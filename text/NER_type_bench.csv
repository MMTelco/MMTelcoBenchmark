"LR and LC have no knowledge about affected NEs when LSA Spectrum Resource Availability information is exchanged from LR to LC (see [5]). Therefore the interaction at the NE level scenario requires input at the LC from MNO about the NEs that belongs to a LSR. This input is part of the mapping but also set to out-of-scope in ETSI RRS. Advantages with interaction at the NE level: No advantage is found. Disadvantages with interaction at the NE level: a) The operator's management systems are bypassed, which might mean that the management systems do not know which cells are using which frequency, if the cells are taken into operation, or if statistic measurements should be subscribed for them, etc. b) Currently the LR doesnât know how the PLMN (MFCN) is organized, i.e. LR has to send LSRAI to all registered LCs.

Differences in UL performances are due to the noise rise criterion that we think inadequate for systems that use JD technique.

If the network perform x+y transmissions, the call drop ratio will be further reduced, e.g. 4.32% for IHR (2) and 2.78 for IHR (2+2). For increased power for HS-DSCH transmission mode, the call drop ratio is lower than the IHR (2) mode, but higher than all other IHR modes.

Tc value is supposed to be known since it corresponds to a system parameter. Due to several impairments, a shift in Tc value may occur, a tracking mechanism must be applied. The most general method for time synchronization is done by fulfilling an auto-correlation over the received signal with a length equal to the cyclic prefix length. Since the cyclic prefix is a copy of the last part of the OFDM symbol, the autocorrelation will present a peak when it is done between the cyclic prefix (which is located at the beginning of the OFDM symbol) and the last part of the same OFDM symbol of the same length. This allows the detection of the beginning of the OFDM symbol. Time synchronization tracking is done by the same technique.

"The Evolved Packet System applies the PCC framework as defined in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6] for QoS policy and charging control. PCC functionality is present in the AF, PCEF and PCRF. An EPS needs to both PCEF and PCRF functionality to enable dynamic policy and charging control by means of installation of PCC rules based on user and service dimensions. However, an EPS may only PCEF functionality in which case it shall static policy and charging control. NOTE: The local configuration of PCEF static policy and charging control functionality is not subject to standardization. The PCEF static policy and control functionality is not based on subscription information. The following applies to the use of dynamic policy and charging control in EPS: - The service level (per SDF) QoS parameters are conveyed in PCC rules (one PCC rule per SDF) over the Gx reference point. The service level QoS parameters consist of a QoS Class Identifier (QCI) Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) and authorised Guaranteed and Maximum Bit Rate values for uplink and downlink. The QCI is a scalar that represents the QoS characteristics that the EPS is expected to provide for the SDF. ARP is an indicator of the priority for the SDF that is used to decide about the assignment of resources due to resource limitations. The service level ARP assigned by PCRF in a PCC rule may be different from the bearer level ARP stored in subscription data; - The set of standardized QCIs and their characteristics that the PCRF in an EPS can select from is provided in TS 23.203[ Policy and charging control architecture ]  [6].

The gNB-DU includes RRCResumeRequest in a non-UE associated INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message and transfer to the gNB-CU. 5. For UE Inactive to UE Active transitions, excluding transitions due to signalling exchange only, the gNB-CU allocates gNB-CU UE F1AP ID and sends UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to gNB-DU, which may include SRB ID(s) and DRB ID(s) to be setup, CellGroupConfig stored in gNB-CU or retrieved from the old NG-RAN node may also be included.

The gNB-CU generates RRCResume/RRCSetup/RRCReject/RRCRelease message or receives RRCRelease message from the old NG-RAN node towards the UE. The RRC message is encapsulated in DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message together with SRB ID. 8. The gNB-DU forwards RRC message to the UE either over SRB0 or SRB1 as indicated by the SRB ID.

If step 5 and 6 are not performed, the gNB-DU deduces the SRB on which to deliver the RRC message in step 7 from the SRB ID, i.e. SRB ID â0â corresponds to SRB0, SRB ID â1â corresponds to SRB1. 9.

"Load balancing is achieved in NR with handover, redirection mechanisms upon RRC release and through the usage of inter-frequency and inter-RAT absolute priorities and inter-frequency Qoffset parameters. Measurements to be performed by a UE for connected mode mobility are classified in at least four measurement types: - Intra-frequency NR measurements; - Inter-frequency NR measurements; - Inter-RAT measurements for E-UTRA; - Inter-RAT measurements for UTRA. For each measurement type one or several measurement objects can be defined (a measurement object defines e.g. the carrier frequency to be monitored). For each measurement object one or several reporting configurations can be defined (a reporting configuration defines the reporting criteria). Three reporting criteria are used: event triggered reporting, periodic reporting and event triggered periodic reporting. The association between a measurement object and a reporting configuration is created by a measurement identity (a measurement identity links together one measurement object and one reporting configuration of the same RAT). By using several measurement identities (one for each measurement object, reporting configuration pair) it is then possible to: - Associate several reporting configurations to one measurement object and; - Associate one reporting configuration to several measurement objects. The measurements identity is used as well when reporting results of the measurements. Measurement quantities are considered separately for each RAT. Measurement commands are used by NG-RAN to order the UE to start, modify or stop measurements. Handover can be performed within the same RAT and/or CN, or it can involve a change of the RAT and/or CN. Inter system fallback towards E-UTRAN is performed when 5GC does not support emergency services, voice services, for load balancing etc. Depending on factors such as CN interface availability, network configuration and radio conditions, the fallback procedure results in either RRC_CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or RRC_IDLE state mobility (redirection), see TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3] and TS 38.331[ NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [12]. SRVCC from 5G to UTRAN, if supported by both the UE and the network, may be performed to handover a UE with an ongoing voice call from NR to UTRAN. The overall procedure is described in TS 23.216[ Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC); Stage 2 ]  [34]. See also TS 38.331[ NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification ]  [12] and TS 38.413[ NG-RAN; NG Application Protocol (NGAP) ]  [26]. In the NG-C signalling procedure, the AMF based on support for emergency services, voice service, any other services or for load balancing etc, may indicate the target CN type as EPC or 5GC to the gNB node. When the target CN type is received by gNB, the target CN type is also conveyed to the UE in RRCRelease Message.

To enable the eNodeB to determine which MME to select when forwarding messages from an UE, this functionality defines a routing mechanism (and other related mechanism). A routing mechanism (and other related mechanism) is defined for the MMEs. The routing mechanism is required to find the correct old MME (from the multiple MMEs that are associated with a pool area). When a UE roams out of the pool area and into the area of one or more MMEs that do not know about the internal structure of the pool area where the UE roamed from, the new MME will send the Identification Request message or the Context Request message to the old MME using the GUTI. The routing mechanism in both the MMEs and the eNodeB utilises the fact that every MME that serves a pool area must have its own unique value range of the GUTI parameter within the pool area.",RAN,"The Radio Access Network (RAN) is a critical component in the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) architecture, responsible for managing radio resources and providing access to the core network.

"A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates its support in the Registration Request message in the Initial Registration and the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability. When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If the HPLMN changes NSSRG information in the subscription information for a UE, the UDM updates the supporting AMF serving the UE with the new NSSRG information and the AMF, possibly after interaction with the NSSF (see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]), updates the UE as necessary with network slicing configuration by means of the UE Configuration Update procedure (this may include changes in the Configured NSSAI (and related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed NSSAI as applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update according to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and that has received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI shall only request S-NSSAIs, across all Access Type(s) regardless of whether the same PLMN or different PLMNs are used, that share one or more common NSSRG. NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG. An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the default S-NSSAI(s). The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI. The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM instructs the supporting AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the UE can be given a Configured NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. If this indication is received from the UDM by the AMF, this is included in the UE context. Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to roaming agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a non-supporting VPLMN with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription information.

The support of this feature is uniform across the SNPN as specified in TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. The following information is broadcast to support SNPN access with subscription of a Credentials Holder: - an indication per SNPN in SIB1 that access using credentials from a Credentials Holder is supported; - optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be assigned to one or more SNPNs); - an optional indication per SNPN in SIB1 that the SNPN allows registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN. The above listed items are forwarded to the UE NAS layer that uses them for SNPN selection. 16.6.6 Support of UE onboarding and remote provisioning An SNPN may offer support for restricted 3GPP connectivity for remote provisioning of credentials. The feature is enabled/disabled per cell. The following information is broadcast to support UE onboarding and remote provisioning: - an indication per onboarding SNPN in SIB1 that UE onboarding is enabled; - optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be assigned to one or more onboarding SNPNs).

For connection failure due to intra-LTE or inter-RAT mobility, three kinds of failures were identified: too late HO, too early HO and HO to a wrong cell. The detection of the events is enabled by the RLF Indication and HO Report procedures. By analysing the report from UE and network side information, HO related parameters could be adjusted to resolve the detected problems. For unnecessary HO to another RAT, the RAN node in the other RAT, may instruct the UE to continue to evaluate the received measurement reports with the coverage/quality condition received during the inter-RAT HO preparation phase and decide if an inter-RAT unnecessary HO report",HO,"Handover (HO) is a procedure in LTE networks that involves the transfer of a user's connection from one cell to another, either within the same Radio Access Technology (RAT) or between different RATs.

3.        The authorization decision is provided in the AAA together with the APN to be used for creation of the MBMS UE context. If the AAA indicates that the UE is not authorized to receive the MBMS data the process terminates with no additional message exchange.
4.        The GGSN sends an MBMS Notification Request (IP multicast address, APN, Linked NSAPI) to the SGSN. Linked NSAPI is set equal to the NSAPI of the PDP context over which the Join request was received. The IP multicast address is the one requested by the UE in the Join request. The APN may be different from the APN to which the default PDP context has been activated. In any case, the APN may resolve to a GGSN that is different from the GGSN receiving the IGMP/MLD Join request. The GGSN starts a MBMS Activation Timer as GGSN may receive no response, e.g. in case SGSN or UE does not support MBMS.

"Diameter is used as the protocol between the P-GW and a Diameter server or proxy for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to the user session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the P-GW to release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular bearer or Resource Allocation Deactivation procedures as defined in TSÂ 23.402Â [78]). For this purpose, the Diameter server or proxy may send a Diameter ASR along with the EPS bearer ID, if available, to identify the particular bearer to be terminated to the P-GW.

If the P-GW deletes the corresponding bearer, it need not wait for the response from the S-GW or trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG before sending the ASA to the server.

The OFF power for LTE is averaged over 70 us. The ON power is averaged over 1 ms. However the transmitted signal quality requirements apply during the ON period which prevents too much variation in the on power. The transient time is 17 us for the OFF to ON transition and 17us for the ON to OFF transition. For UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps option the OFF power is averaged over one timeslot excluding guard periods which is approximately 675 us. The OFF to ON transition is 8 chips which becomes 6.25 us. The ON to OFF transition period is 85 + 3 chips where the last 3 chips allow for a transition from -42 dBm to the OFF power level. The total duration of this period is approximately 68 us. Short transition times results in larger possible cell radius and to avoid replanning of networks the most stringent requirements from LTE and UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps option is adopted.

"This procedure allows for Ethernet PDU Sessions to change the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) while the session remains set up. Originally the Ethernet PDU Session goes via the Source UPF acting as the PSA. The Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) is reported from the Source PSA UPF to the SMF. It is possible to report multiple MAC addresses (with their VLAN tag(s)) if these are reachable via the UE. The SMF determines whether and when a serving PDU Session anchor for an Ethernet PDU Session needs to be changed and selects the Target PSA UPF, establishes the N4 session at the Target PSA UPF. The information within the Ethernet context is sent to the Target UPF. Based on the information in the Ethernet context, the Target PSA UPF may take action to update the Ethernet forwarding in the data network. Figure 4.3.5.8-1: Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation Initially, the Ethernet PDU Session is established with the user data going via the Source UPF. The Source UPF acts as the PSA. 1. The Source UPF reports the Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) that the UPF has learned from the UE side to the SMF. In the case of any changes in the Ethernet context, the change is updated to the SMF so that the SMF maintains an up-to-date state of the Ethernet context. This signalling is realized based on N4 reporting. 2. The UPF's report is acknowledged. 3-5. In the case of handover, the RAN handover preparation and execution is followed by path switch signalling to the AMF and corresponding signalling to SMF, as defined in clause 4.9.1.2. 6. The SMF decides that the PSA is to be changed for the Ethernet PDU Session and selects the Target UPF that will act as the new PSA. The decision may be triggered by a mobility event, such as receiving the message in step 5. 7. The Target UPF N4 session is established. The SMF provides the N3 tunnel endpoint used by RAN. 8. The establishment of the new N4 session is acknowledged from the Target UPF to the SMF. The UPF provides its N3 tunnel endpoint. 9-10. In the case of handover, the SMF signals to the RAN via the AMF to provide the Path Switch Request Ack, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. This signalling is defined in clause 4.9.1.2. In steps 9-10, an indication is sent from the SMF via the AMF to the RAN node indicating that the RAN node should not expect to receive an end marker packet. The RAN node may skip trying to reorder the downlink packets. 11-12. If there is no handover and the UE is in connected mode, the SMF sends PDU Session Modify Request message to the RAN via the AMF, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. The RAN acknowledges the message. The RAN node does not need to to reorder the downlink packets. NOTE 1: Due to the change in the end to end path, packet re-ordering can occur both for the handover and no handover cases. If necessary, upper layer protocols can ensure in sequence delivery. After steps 9-10 or 11-12, uplink Ethernet frames pass via the target UPF. Downlink Ethernet frames may continue to be delivered from the source UPF to the RAN node. In the case of handover, the Ethernet frames are forwarded from the source RAN node to the target RAN node. 13-14. The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Target UPF which includes the information in Ethernet context (i.e. MAC address and VLAN tag(s)) and a trigger for updating the Ethernet forwarding (next step). The Target UPF acknowledges by an N4 Session Modification Response. 15. The Target UPF may assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of Ethernet switches in the DN via a variety of mechanisms, the use of which are specific to the DN and the specification of which are out-of-scope for 3GPP. NOTE 2: The UPF acting as a switch in the DN, can for example issue a Gratuitous ARP (GARP) containing the MAC address(es) of the UE that has switched to the new anchor, or the UPF can send an unsolicited Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Neighbor Advertisement message indicating the UE MAC addresses, or the UPF can generate a uplink Ethernet frame with the UE's MAC addresses as source MAC addresses (and possibly its VLAN tag(s)) and configurable payload which will be dropped by endhosts, or the UPF can send another message or Ethernet frame compatible with DN protocols. In the case of a central controller in the Ethernet network which sets the forwarding tables, the central controller can be instructed that the given MAC address is reachable at the new location. When multiple MAC addresses are present in the Ethernet context, the update of the Ethernet forwarding is performed for each MAC address. 16. The N4 session is released at the Source UPF. The source UPF may wait for a configurable period before it stops delivering downlink Ethernet frames for the given PDU Session. 17.

"In current LAN environments the most commonly used configuration protocol is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, RFC 2131Â [26]) and DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6, IETF RFC 3315Â [46]). It provides a mechanism for passing a large set of configuration parameters to hosts connected to a TCP/IP network (IP address, sub-net mask, domain name, MTU, etc.) in an automatic manner. Moreover DHCP may assign IP addresses to clients for a finite lease time, allowing for sequential reassignment of addresses to different users.
The lease time is chosen by the administrator of the DHCP server (in the external network), and is therefore out of the scope of the present document.
The Packet Domain may obtain IP address via external DHCP server during the packet bearer establishment procedures (e.g. PDP Context activation, default bearer establishment). The GGSN/P-GW acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server.
The Packet Domain offers the end user the possibility to run DHCP end-to-end the same way as he does when connected directly to a LAN (e.g. an enterprise Intranet). No modifications should be required in common implementations of DHCP clients and servers. However in non-EPC based Packet Domain, a DHCP relay agent function is needed in the GGSN so as to allow correct routing of DHCP requests and replies between the TE and the DHCP servers. In EPC based Packet Domain for 3GPP access networks, the P-GW acts a DHCP server towards the UE and it acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server. For trusted non-3GPP access networks, the non-3GPP access network may act as a DHCP relay or DHCP server. In the trusted WLAN access network, the TWAN acts a DHCP server towards the UE and PGW acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server for the GTP/PMIP-based S2a.
In non-EPC based Packet Domain,at PDP context activation no IP address is allocated, this is done afterwards through DHCP. After the TEâs configuration has been completed by DHCP, the PDP context is updated by means of the GGSN-initiated PDP Context Modification Procedure in order to reflect the newly assigned IP address.
In the following cases the bearer associated with the allocated IP address (i.e. IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix) shall be released:
-        if the DHCP lease expires;
-        if the DHCP renewal is rejected by the DHCP server;
-        if the IP address is changed during the renewal process. Usually when the lease is renewed, the IP address remains unchanged. However, if for any reason (e.g. poor configuration of the DHCP server), a different IP address is allocated during the lease renewal process the associated bearer shall be released.",PMIP,The PMIP-based S2a interface involves the use of DHCP relay or DHCP server functions to manage IP address allocation for devices connected to the trusted non-3GPP access network.,Protocol,3GPP TS 29.061

In the case of SFN-SFN, its time derivative (or drift rate) is eventually determined by the clock stabilities of Node Bs between which the SFN-SFN is measured. In the case of TUTRAN-GPS, the additional drift rate is coming from the clock stability of the measured Node B. When the Node B clock stability requirement is 0.05 ppm, it means that in the worst case the SFN-SFN value might change with the drift rate 0.1 ppm (one Node B is drifting 0.05 ppm to one direction while the other is drifting 0.05 ppm to another direction). Thus SFN-SFN drift rate might be as high as 30 m/s. For TUTRAN-GPS the worst case is 0.05 ppm drift rate, i.e. 15 m/s. Expected location accuracy of OTDOA-IPDL can be rather high.

"Figure 4.16.7.3-1: The procedure for BDT warning notification 1. The negotiation for Background Data Transfer (BDT) described in clause 4.16.7.2 is completed. In addition, the PCF has subscribed to analytics on ""Network Performance"" from NWDAF for the area of interest and time window of a background data transfer policy following the procedure and services described in TS 23.288[ Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support network data analytics services ]  [50], including a Reporting Threshold in the Analytics Reporting information. The value for Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF based on operator configuration. 2. The PCF is notified with the network performance analytics in the area of interest from the NWDAF when the NWDAF determines that the network performance goes below the threshold as described for the Network Performance analytics in TS 23.288[ Architecture enhancements for 5G System (5GS) to support network data analytics services ]  [50]. 3. The H-PCF may request from the UDR the stored BDT policies using Nudr_DM_Query (Policy Data, Background Data Transfer) service operation. 4. The UDR provides all the Background Transfer Policies together with the relevant information received from the AF (as defined in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503[ Policy and charging control framework for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 ]  [20]) to the H-PCF. 5. The H-PCF identifies the BDT policies affected by the notification received from NWDAF. For each of them, the H-PCF determines the ASP of which the background traffic will be influenced by the degradation of network performance and which requested the H-PCF to send the notification. The PCF then performs the following steps for each of the determined ASPs, i.e. Steps 6 - 16 can occur multiple times (i.e. once per ASP). 6. The PCF decides based on operator policies, whether a new list of candidate Background Data Transfer policies can be calculated for the ASP. If the PCF does not find any new candidate BDT policy, the previously negotiated BDT policy shall be kept, no interaction with that ASP shall occur and the procedure stops for that BDT policy. NOTE 1: The BDT policies of an ASP which did not request to be notified are kept and no interaction with this ASP occurs. 7. The PCF sets the no longer valid BDT policy in the UDR as invalidated by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, invalidation flag) service. NOTE 2: The BDT policies that are applicable for future sessions are checked by the PCF in step 6. 8. The UDR sends a response to the H-PCF as acknowledgement. 9. The PCF sends the notification to the NEF by invoking Npcf_PolicyControl_Notify (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, list of candidate Background Data Transfer policies) service operation. 10. The NEF sends the BDT warning notification to the AF by invoking Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Notify (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, list of candidate Background Data Transfer policies) service operation. 11. The AF checks the new Background Data Transfer policies included in the candidate list in the BDT warning notification. 12. If the AF selects any of the new Background Data Transfer policies, the steps 8-13 from clause 4.16.7.2 are executed. 13. If the AF doesn't select any of the new Background Data Transfer policies, the steps 8-11 from clause 4.16.7.2 are executed, with the AF indicating that none of the candidate Background Data Transfer policies is acceptable. 14.-15. If the step 13 is executed, the PCF removes the no longer valid BDT policy from UDR for the corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID. NOTE 3: The PCF can also remove the no longer valid BDT policy after an operator configurable time for the case that the AF does not respond. 16. If there is a new Background Data Transfer policy stored in the UDR or a BDT policy removed from the UDR, the PCFs are notified by the UDR accordingly. The PCFs check if the corresponding URSP rules need to be updated or removed and if so, use the procedure defined in clause 4.16.12.2 to update URSP rules for the relevant UEs. The AF can send a Stop notification by invoking Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Update service, when the AF requests not to receive the BDT warning notification anymore.

"A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates its support in the Registration Request message in the Initial Registration and the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability. When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If the HPLMN changes NSSRG information in the subscription information for a UE, the UDM updates the supporting AMF serving the UE with the new NSSRG information and the AMF, possibly after interaction with the NSSF (see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]), updates the UE as necessary with network slicing configuration by means of the UE Configuration Update procedure (this may include changes in the Configured NSSAI (and related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed NSSAI as applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update according to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and that has received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI shall only request S-NSSAIs, across all Access Type(s) regardless of whether the same PLMN or different PLMNs are used, that share one or more common NSSRG. NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG. An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the default S-NSSAI(s). The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI. The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM instructs the supporting AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the UE can be given a Configured NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. If this indication is received from the UDM by the AMF, this is included in the UE context. Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to roaming agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a non-supporting VPLMN with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription information. In this case the AMF provides the UE with a Configured NSSAI including all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information the AMF receives. The AMF provides no NSSRG information to a non-supporting UE.

If the maximum number has not been reached then the NSACF increases the number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection and add an entry for UE ID. If the maximum number of UEs has already been reached, unless operator policy implements a different action, the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDU Session/PDN connection indicating the cause being the number of UEs in the network slice has been exceeded. - When the NSACF receives request to decrease the current number of PDU Session/PDN Connection established for the network slice, the NSACF locates the UE entry, checks whether this is the last PDU Session/PDN Connection associated with the network slice for the UE. If it is the last PDU Session/PDN Connection the NSACF decreases the number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection and remove the associated UE entry. NOTE 1: A PLMN can deploy one of the above two options for a slice when EPS counting is required for a network slice and NSACF is configured with maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection. NSACF is configured with the information of whether the NSAC for number of UEs with at least one PDU session/PDN connection is based on Option1 or Option 2. In both options, the SMF+PGW-C provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a request to increase or decrease or update the number of UEs with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection and/or the number of PDU Sessions for an S-NSSAI. In the case of roaming, same mechanisms in clause 5.15.11.3 are used and number of registered UE is replaced with number of UE with at least one PDU Session/PDN Connection. For home routed PDU Session/PDN Connection only HPLMN admission mode can be used in this case. If hierarchical NSAC architecture is deployed, when the local maximum number or local threshold is reached the NSAC may interact with the Primary NSACF before it returns the response back to the SMF+PGW-C. For more details on handling at the NSACF and Primary NSACF see clause 5.15.11.1.2. NOTE 2: When NSAC for number of UEs with at least one PDU session or one PDN connection is used, the session continuity is guaranteed at inter-system mobility as the admission is granted during the establishment of the PDU Session/PDN Connection.",NSACF,The NSACF keeps track of the current number of UEs with at least one PDU session/PDN connection established on a network slice to ensure it does not exceed the maximum configured number.,Network Function,3GPP TS 23.501
"A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates its support in the Registration Request message in the Initial Registration and the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability. When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If the HPLMN changes NSSRG information in the subscription information for a UE, the UDM updates the supporting AMF serving the UE with the new NSSRG information and the AMF, possibly after interaction with the NSSF (see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]), updates the UE as necessary with network slicing configuration by means of the UE Configuration Update procedure (this may include changes in the Configured NSSAI (and related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed NSSAI as applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update according to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502[ Procedures for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [3]. At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and that has received NSSRG information together with the Configured NSSAI shall only request S-NSSAIs, across all Access Type(s) regardless of whether the same PLMN or different PLMNs are used, that share one or more common NSSRG. NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG. An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM. In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those defined for the default S-NSSAI(s). The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI. The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM instructs the supporting AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the UE can be given a Configured NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. If this indication is received from the UDM by the AMF, this is included in the UE context. Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to roaming agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a non-supporting VPLMN with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription information. In this case the AMF provides the UE with a Configured NSSAI including all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information the AMF receives. The AMF provides no NSSRG information to a non-supporting UE. When an AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature, receives from a UE a Requested NSSAI including S-NSSAIs that are supported in the Tracking Area but do not share a common NSSRG, or the AMF has pending NSSAI stored for the UE, and the S-NSSAI(s) of the requested NSSAI and the pending NSSAI do not share a common NSSRG, the AMF assumes the UE configuration is not up-to-date, and provides the following: - a supporting UE with an updated configuration including the up-to-date NSSRG information for the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI as described above. - a non-supporting UE with an updated Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), only for the case where the UE context does not include an indication to provide all the subscribed S-NSSAIs in the subscription information in the Configured NSSAI for the UE.",AMF,"The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) is a network function that plays a crucial role in managing the access and mobility of User Equipment (UEs) in a 5G network.

For multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, the UE performs PUCCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial relations. For inter-cell multi-TRP operation, for multi-DCI PDSCH transmission, one or more TCI states can be associated with SSB with a PCI different from the serving cell PCI. The activated TCI states can be associated with at most one PCI different from the serving cell PCI at a time. For inter-cell and intra-cell multi-DCI multi-TRP operation, up to two TAGs with associated TAG IDs can be configured per serving cell. Each UL/Joint TCI state is associated with a TAG ID and the UE applies the timing advance of the TAG ID associated with the UL/joint TCI state utilized for UL transmission. For single-DCI multi-TRP Simultaneous Transmission with Multi-Panel (STxMP) Spatial Domain Multiplexing (SDM) PUSCH transmission, different layers of one PUSCH are separately transmitted towards two TRPs. For single-DCI multi-TRP STxMP SFN PUSCH transmission, same layers of one PUSCH are transmitted towards two TRPs.

"This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios. Figure 4.3.4.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for home-routed roaming 1. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events: 1a. (UE initiated release) As in step 1a of clause 4.3.4.2 with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, information from the SM message from the UE e.g. PCO, ""Trigger PDU Session Release"" indication, Timezone, User Location Information) service operation to request the H-SMF to release the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. 1b. (Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates the PDU Session Release during UE or serving network initiated Deregistration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.3. There is no NAS SM message between the UE and the V-SMF in this case. This step is the same as step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU Session at the H-SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request. The serving network also initiates the PDU Session Release where neither N1 nor N2 SM signalling is needed before releasing the SM context as in step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2 if e.g. due to the set of network slices for a UE changes where a network slice instance is no longer available (e.g. as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2], or the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4). 1c. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1d. This step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. 1e. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1e in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - if the H-SMF is notified by the V-SMF that the HPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session with SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 is to be replaced with Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and if the H-SMF determines that a new PDU Session is to be established on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the H-SMF initiates release of the PDU Session, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501[ System architecture for the 5G System (5GS) ]  [2]; - the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic. 1f. This step is the same as step 1f in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and - the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF. If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1c, 1e or 1f, the H-SMF starts PDU Session Release procedure. When a SMF above initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the UPF to stop forwarding traffic this means also to stop taking into account the traffic for usage monitoring. 2a-2b. (UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF. These steps are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.3.4.2. The SMF is the SMF in HPLMN. NOTE 1: This step 2a-2b can correspond to steps 1a, 1b, 1d, 1f. 3a. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF prepares the SM Release PDU Session Command message and initiates the PDU Session Release towards the UE by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request service operation towards the V-SMF. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for example a Release Cause or PCO). For network slice replacement as in step 1e, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 3b. (Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response. If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF. If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session, the steps 4a and 4b are skipped. 4a-4b. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN. 5-13. These steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that: - In step 5c, for network slice replacement, based on information from H-SMF, the PDU Session Release Command message may include Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required. 14. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data. 15a. (UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b and step 3b. 15b-15c. (HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2. 15d. As in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation. NOTE 2: Step 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c. 16. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts associated with the PDU Session: 16a. The H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation. 16b.

"In MR-DC, the UE has a single RRC state, based on the MN RRC and a single C-plane connection towards the Core Network. Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the Control plane architecture for MR-DC. Each radio node has its own RRC entity (E-UTRA version if the node is an eNB or NR version if the node is a gNB) which can generate RRC PDUs to be sent to the UE. RRC PDUs generated by the SN can be transported via the MN to the UE. The MN always sends the initial SN RRC configuration via MCG SRB (SRB1), but subsequent reconfigurations may be transported via MN or SN. When transporting RRC PDU from the SN, the MN does not modify the UE configuration provided by the SN. In E-UTRA connected to EPC, at initial connection establishment SRB1 uses E-UTRA PDCP. If the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-DC is configured or not, after initial connection establishment, MCG SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2) can be configured by the network to use either E-UTRA PDCP or NR PDCP (either SRB1 and SRB2 are both configured with E-UTRA PDCP, or they are both configured with NR PDCP). Change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP (or vice-versa) is supported via a handover procedure (reconfiguration with mobility) or, for the initial change of SRB1 from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP, with a reconfiguration without mobility before the initial security activation. If the SN is a gNB (i.e. for EN-DC, NGEN-DC and NR-DC), the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB3) to enable RRC PDUs for the SN to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. RRC PDUs for the SN can only be transported directly to the UE for SN RRC reconfiguration not requiring any coordination with the MN. Measurement reporting for mobility within the SN can be done directly from the UE to the SN if SRB3 is configured. In NR-DC, the UE can be configured to establish a SRB with the SN (SRB5) to enable RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information to be sent directly between the UE and the SN. The application measurement report can be sent directly from the UE to the SN if SRB5 is configured and indicated by the network for the application measurement reporting. Split SRB is supported for all MR-DC options, allowing duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the MN, via the direct path and via the SN. Split SRB uses NR PDCP. This version of the specification does not support the duplication of RRC PDUs generated by the SN via the MN and SN paths. In EN-DC, the SCG configuration is kept in the UE during suspension. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with EN-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, the UE releases the SCG configuration (but not the radio bearer configuration) during resumption initiation. In MR-DC with 5GC, the UE stores the PDCP/SDAP configuration and the SCG configuration when moving to RRC Inactive. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with MR-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, it releases the SCG configuration.

"In this case:
-        the MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. The address is given either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at PDP context activation in which case it is a dynamic address. This address is used for packet forwarding within the GGSN and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. This requires a link between the GGSN and an address allocation server, such as AAA, or DHCP, belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
-        the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP administrator.
The following description bullet items describe the signal flow.
1)        The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters.
2)        The MT sends the Activate PDP context request message to the SGSN which sends the Create PDP context request message to the chosen GGSN.
3)        The GGSN deduces from the APN:
-        the server(s) to be used for address allocation and authentication;
-        the protocol such as RADIUS, DHCP or L2TP to be used with this / those server(s);
-        the communication and security feature needed to dialogue with this / those server(s) e.g. tunnel ,IPSec security association, dial-up connection (using possibly PPP).
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
-        RADIUS for authentication and IP-address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN;
-        RADIUS for authentication and DHCP for host configuration and address allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN. After a successful authentication, the DHCP client discovers the DHCP server(s) in the ISP/Intranet and receives host configuration data;
-        L2TP for forwarding PPP frames to a L2TP Network Server.
4)        The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message.
5)        Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response the SGSN may either send the Activate PDP Context Accept message or send the Activate PDP Context Reject message to the MS.
6)        The MT responds with an AT-response that may indicate whether the context activation was successful or not. In the case of a non-successful context activation the response may also indicate the cause.
In case of a successful context activation, the TE will start its PPP protocol after the LLC link has been established. The LCP, Authentication and NCP negotiations are then carried out. During these negotiations the GGSN may acknowledge values, for any LCP options related to âL2â framing (e.g. âACCMâ, âACFCâ and âFCS-Alternativesâ), as proposed by the MT, which itself is forwarding these negotiations from the TE.
NOTE:        With the <PDP Type>""PPP"" the MT may provide a PPP relay (or proxy) function between the TE and GGSN. This gives the opportunity for the MT to intercept the âL2â framing end to end negotiations.
EXAMPLE:        In the following example the successful PDP context activation is shown.
