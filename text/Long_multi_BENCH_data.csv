Question,Answer,Proof
Describe the process of CN node selection and attach procedure for a Mobile Station (MS) as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.236.,"The process of CN node selection and attach procedure for a Mobile Station (MS) as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.236 involves several steps and interactions between different network elements. 

Firstly, the new CN node selects the old CN node which was previously serving the MS. This selection is necessary for the new CN node to communicate with the old CN node to retrieve important information such as the IMSI of the MS or the MM and PDP contexts. 

During the attach procedure, the RNC selects an SGSN to serve the MS. The attach request, which includes the old P-TMSI, old RAI, and old P-TMSI Signature, is carried in the Initial Direct Transfer message from the MS to the RNC. The RNC then relays this attach request to the SGSN in the Initial UE message. If the MS identifies itself with P-TMSI and the SGSN has changed since detach, the new SGSN sends an Identification Request to the old SGSN to request the IMSI. The old SGSN responds with the Identification Response, which includes the IMSI and authentication information. If the MS is not known in the old SGSN, an appropriate error cause is returned.

If the MS is unknown in both the old and new SGSN, the SGSN sends an Identity Request to the MS, which responds with the IMSI. Authentication functions are mandatory if no MM context exists anywhere in the network, and ciphering procedures are applied if P-TMSI allocation is going to be done and the network supports ciphering. Equipment checking functions are optional.

If the SGSN number has changed since the GPRS detach or if it is the very first attach, the SGSN informs the HLR by sending an Update Location message. The HLR then sends a Cancel Location message to the old SGSN, which acknowledges and waits for ongoing procedures to finish before removing the MM and PDP contexts. The HLR sends Insert Subscriber Data to the new SGSN, which validates the MS's presence in the new RA. If subscription restrictions apply, the SGSN rejects the attach request with an appropriate cause. If all checks are successful, the SGSN constructs an MM context for the MS and returns an Insert Subscriber Data Ack to the HLR. The HLR acknowledges the Update Location message after the old MM context is cancelled and the new MM context is inserted.

If the attach type indicated GPRS attach while already IMSI attached or combined GPRS/IMSI attached, the VLR is updated if the Gs interface is installed. The SGSN starts the location update procedure towards the new MSC/VLR upon receipt of the first Insert Subscriber Data message from the HLR. The SGSN sends a Location Update Request to the VLR, which creates an association with the SGSN. If the LA update is inter-MSC, the new VLR sends Update Location to the HLR, which sends a Cancel Location to the old VLR. The old VLR acknowledges, and the HLR sends Insert Subscriber Data to the new VLR, which acknowledges. After finishing the inter-MSC location update procedures, the HLR responds with Update Location Ack to the new VLR, which responds with Location Update Accept to the SGSN. The SGSN creates an association with the VLR.

Finally, the SGSN sends an Attach Accept message to the MS, which includes the P-TMSI, VLR TMSI, P-TMSI Signature, and Radio Priority SMS. If P-TMSI or VLR TMSI was changed, the MS acknowledges by returning an Attach Complete message to the SGSN. If VLR TMSI was changed, the SGSN confirms the re-allocation by sending a TMSI Reallocation Complete message to the VLR.","The answer must include the criteria for CN node selection, the process of selecting the old CN node by the new CN node, the detailed steps involved in the attach procedure including signaling flow, identification, authentication, location update, and message exchanges between various network elements. It should also cover the communication requirements between new and old CN nodes and the handling of IMSI, MM, and PDP contexts."

The Service-level-AA server address information element, detailed in 3GPP TS 24.501 clause 9.11.2.12, carries the address of the service level authentication and authorization server. This is also a type 4 information element, with a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 258 octets.

The Service-level-AA payload information element, described in 3GPP TS 24.501 clause 9.11.2.13, carries the upper layer payload for authentication and authorization between the UE and the service-level-AA server. It is a type 6 information element with a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 65538 octets.

The Service-level-AA response information element, as outlined in 3GPP TS 24.501 clause 9.11.2.14, provides information regarding the service level authentication and authorization request, such as indicating whether the request was successful or if the authorization is revoked. This is a type 4 information element with a fixed length of 3 octets.

In 3GPP TS 27.007, the +CUUAAPT parameter command syntax utilizes these information elements as follows:

Describe the conditions under which the RES parameter is included in the Authentication Response Parameter IE and the Remaining Authentication Response Parameter IE in a UMTS authentication challenge according to 3GPP TS 24.008.,"In a UMTS authentication challenge, the RES parameter is included in the Authentication Response Parameter IE and the Remaining Authentication Response Parameter IE under specific conditions. The Authentication Response Parameter IE contains the RES, specifically the 4 most significant octets if the RES is greater than 4 octets in length. This IE is used to convey the initial part of the RES. 

The Remaining Authentication Response Parameter IE is included only if the RES parameter is greater than 4 octets in length and the authentication challenge was UMTS. This IE contains the least significant remaining bits of the RES. It is important to note that the Remaining Authentication Response Parameter IE is not included if a SIM is inserted in the Mobile Station (MS). 

Therefore, the inclusion of these IEs depends on the length of the RES and the type of authentication challenge, with specific rules governing their presence and content.","The answer should explain that the Authentication Response Parameter IE includes the SRES for GSM authentication or the RES for UMTS authentication, specifically the 4 most significant octets if the RES is greater than 4 octets.

Describe the protocol error handling procedures for messages containing a Facility Information Element in 3GPP TS 44.071.,"The protocol error handling procedures for messages containing a Facility Information Element in 3GPP TS 44.071 involve several steps and checks to ensure proper processing and error management. Initially, messages carrying the Facility Information Element (IE) must be checked for protocol errors as specified in subclause 5.7. If a protocol error is found, the procedures outlined in subclause 5.7 apply. Subsequently, the contents of the Facility IE are checked for protocol errors as specified in subclause 4.2.6. If a protocol error is detected in the contents, the procedures in subclause 4.2.6 are followed.

If a location service operation is to be rejected, the operation will be denied, and provided the transaction is still in progress, an appropriate reject component will be returned in a Facility Information Element, as detailed in subclause 4.2.6.

The error handling procedures apply specifically to messages where the protocol discriminator indicates LCS operations according to the rules in 3GPP TS 24.007 and the present document.

"Describe the procedures and mechanisms involved in the recovery and restoration of S-CSCFs as specified in the 3GPP documents TS 23.228, TS 23.380, and TS 29.562.","The recovery and restoration of Serving Call Session Control Functions (S-CSCFs) involve several procedures and mechanisms as outlined in the 3GPP documents TS 23.228, TS 23.380, and TS 29.562.

According to TS 23.228, an Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) that performs recovery of S-CSCFs for registration requests must determine the failure of an S-CSCF either implicitly, through a timeout, or explicitly, via a failure message. Once a failure is detected, the I-CSCF reroutes the registration request to another S-CSCF based on the restoration procedures defined in TS 23.380.

TS 23.380 provides detailed restoration procedures for S-CSCFs, although the specific details are not included in the provided excerpt. These procedures ensure that registration requests are properly rerouted to functioning S-CSCFs to maintain service continuity.

TS 29.562 specifies the process for S-CSCF backup and the update of S-CSCF restoration information in the Home Subscriber Server (HSS). When an S-CSCF needs to update restoration information, it sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE's S-CSCF restoration information.

"What are the criteria and process for sending notifications for supplementary services (ECT, CD, MPTY, CCBS) as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.078 8.3.1?","The criteria for sending notifications for supplementary services such as Explicit Call Transfer (ECT), Call Deflection (CD), Multi-Party (MPTY), and Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) are based on the provisioning and marking of the Supplementary Service Control Information (SS-CSI). Specifically, the subscriber must be provisioned with the SS-CSI, and the particular invoked supplementary service must be marked in the SS-CSI.

For ECT, upon invocation, the Visitor Location Register (VLR) checks the SS-CSI criteria. If fulfilled, a notification is sent to the gsmSCF using the gsmSCF address in the SS-CSI, and the SS-CSI is included in the Invoke ECT response message to the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The processing of the ECT invocation is not suspended.

For CD, the VLR includes the SS-CSI in the Send Info For Incoming Call acknowledgment information flow to the MSC if applicable. The notification criteria are checked, and if fulfilled, a notification is sent to the gsmSCF, with the processing continuing without suspension.

For MPTY, the VLR includes the SS-CSI in the Process MPTY message to the MSC if applicable. Similar to ECT and CD, the notification criteria are checked, and if fulfilled, a notification is sent to the gsmSCF, with the processing continuing without suspension.

For CCBS, the Home Location Register (HLR) checks the SS-CSI criteria upon activation of a CCBS request. If the criteria are fulfilled, a notification is sent to the gsmSCF, and the processing of the CCBS request continues. Additionally, whenever the state of the CCBS request changes, another notification is sent to the gsmSCF, and the processing continues.

The sending of notifications for these supplementary services is independent of call-related CAMEL processing, which includes processing indicated by Originating, Destination, Terminating, and Visiting CAMEL Subscription Information (O/D/T/VT-CSI). Specific message flows for each service are referenced in other 3GPP TS documents, such as TS 23.091 for ECT, TS 23.084 for MPTY, TS 23.072 for CD, and TS 23.093 for CCBS.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of SS-CSI provisioning and marking criteria for notifications
  - Detailed notification process for each supplementary service (ECT, CD, MPTY, CCBS)
  - Clarification that notification sending is independent of call-related CAMEL processing
  - Specific message flows and references to other 3GPP TS documents for each service"
"Describe the procedures and requirements for routing S-NSSAI, local authentication, AAA-S authorization, and counter check in 3GPP specifications.","The procedures and requirements for routing S-NSSAI, local authentication, AAA-S authorization, and counter check in 3GPP specifications are as follows:

1. **Routing S-NSSAI to the Correct AAA-S or AAA-P**:
   - **Requirement**: The NSSAAF forwards the EAP ID Response message to the AAA-P if present, otherwise directly to the AAA-S based on the S-NSSAI.
   - **Test Environment**: Includes AMF, AAA-S, and AAA-P, which may be simulated. The NSSAAF under test is connected with AMF, AAA-S, and AAA-P.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     1. The AMF sends Nssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Req to the NSSAAF including one of the S-NSSAI.
     2. The NSSAAF sends AAA message to an AAA-P.
     3. Repeat step 1 and 2 with the other S-NSSAI, and the NSSAAF sends AAA message to an AAA-S.
   - **Expected Results**: The NSSAAF forwards the NSSAA request to the correct AAA-S or AAA-P based on the S-NSSAI.
   - **Evidence**: Logs and communication flow saved in a .pcap file.

2. **gNB Periodic Local Authentication and PDCP COUNT Check**:
   - **Procedure**: The gNB periodically performs local authentication and checks the amount of data sent during the AS connection. The PDCP COUNT check is used to detect maliciously inserted packets.
   - **Steps**:
     1. When a checking value is reached, a Counter Check message is sent by the gNB containing the most significant parts of the PDCP COUNT values from each active radio bearer.
     2. The UE compares the PDCP COUNT values received in the Counter Check message with its radio bearers and responds with a Counter Check Response message.
     3. If the response contains PDCP COUNT values, the gNB may release the connection or report the difference for further traffic analysis.
   - **Note**: The PDCP COUNT check procedure is superfluous for integrity protected bearers.

3. **AAA-S Authorization in Re-authentication and Revocation Scenarios**:
   - **Requirement**: The NSSAAF checks whether the AAA-S is authorized to request re-authentication and re-authorization by checking the local configuration of AAA-S address per S-NSSAI.
   - **Test Environment**: Includes AAA-S and AAA-P, which may be simulated. The NSSAAF under test is connected with AAA-S and AAA-P.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     1. The AAA-S sends Re-authentication or revocation message to the NSSAAF including the S-NSSAI and the GPSI.
     2. The NSSAAF checks whether the AAA-S can be matched against the S-NSSAI based on the mapping table.
   - **Expected Results**: The NSSAAF either rejects or passes the re-authentication or revocation request.
   - **Evidence**: Logs and communication flow saved in a .pcap file.

4. **Counter Check Procedure Between SN and MN**:
   - **Procedure**: The SN may request the MN to execute a counter check procedure to verify the PDCP COUNT values associated with DRBs offloaded to the SN.
   - **Steps**:
     1. The SN communicates the request, including expected PDCP COUNT values and associated radio bearer identities, to the MN over the Xn-C.
     2. If the MN receives a counter check response from the UE containing PDCP COUNT values, it may release the connection or report the difference for further traffic analysis.
   - **Actions**: Based on the counter check response, the MN may take actions such as releasing the connection or reporting the difference to the serving AMF or O&M server.

These procedures ensure proper routing, authentication, authorization, and security checks within the network as specified in the 3GPP documents.","The answer must include details on how the NSSAAF routes S-NSSAI to the correct AAA-S or AAA-P, the procedure for gNB periodic local authentication and PDCP COUNT check, the authorization process for AAA-S in re-authentication and revocation scenarios, and the counter check procedure between SN and MN. It should cover the test environments, execution steps, and expected results for each requirement."
What are the key issues and proposed solutions for interworking between SSO frameworks and 3GPP authentication mechanisms as outlined in TS 33.995?,"The key issues and proposed solutions for interworking between Single Sign-On (SSO) frameworks and 3GPP authentication mechanisms as outlined in TS 33.995 are as follows:

1. **GBA-lite Implementation (Clause 7.2)**: This issue discusses an implementation option for co-locating the Network Application Function (NAF) and Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) to simplify some Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) functionalities. This approach aims to enable a step-wise introduction of GBA, making it easier to implement and manage.

2. **Presence of the Registered User (Clause 7.3)**: The study focused on confirming the presence of the registered user, as current 3GPP defined SSO mechanisms authenticate the USIM and not the human user. Proposed solutions include performing two-factor authentication using a combination of username/password and GBA-OpenID. These solutions allow either 3GPP or non-3GPP entities to control the second factor credentials, and some can be implemented without impacting 3GPP specifications.

3. **Authorization Function in the UE (Clause 7.4)**: A proposal for a functional architecture of an authorization function within the User Equipment (UE) to perform local user authentication was discussed. This function would handle authentication or authorization policies from the Service Provider/NAF and negotiate local user authentication capabilities. Such local credentials could be provisioned by the operator, similar to UICC credentials.

4. **Third Party User Identities (Clause 7.5)**: The requirement for transparency of 3GPP SSO service when using third party user identities was investigated. The current 3GPP SSO mechanisms, especially GBA-OpenID, meet this requirement. A proposed solution involves mapping third party user identities to User Security Settings (USS) instead of using configuration, which would require changes to TS 33.220.

5. **Negotiation of Authentication Method**: SA1 has a requirement for the 3GPP SSO Service to support negotiation and use of an agreed authentication method between the UE and the 3GPP SSO Identity Provider. This requirement is met by existing standardized mechanisms between the NAF and UE to negotiate which GBA variant to use.

**Conclusion**: The study recommends that no further 3GPP work is conducted for Single Sign-On in the context of the present study. However, the findings could be useful for other 3GPP activities, such as Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT).","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of GBA-lite and its implementation as described in clause 7.2.
  - Discussion on the presence of the registered user and the proposed two-factor authentication solutions from clause 7.3.
  - Description of the authorization function within the UE for local user authentication as proposed in clause 7.4.
  - Analysis of the transparency of 3GPP SSO service when using third party user identities and the proposed mapping solution from clause 7.5.
  - Summary of the overall evaluation and recommendations for future 3GPP work, including the relevance to other 3GPP activities like MCPTT."
"Describe the initial cell search procedure for 1.28Mcps TDD, including the steps involved and their specific functions, as well as the Dedicated Carrier MBSFN initial SFN cell search procedure.","The initial cell search procedure for 1.28Mcps TDD involves four steps, each with specific functions:

Step 1: Search for DwPTS
During the first step, the User Equipment (UE) uses the SYNC-DL in DwPTS to acquire synchronization to a cell. This is typically done using one or more matched filters matched to the received SYNC-DL, which is chosen from a set of PN sequences. The UE needs to identify which of the 32 possible SYNC-DL sequences is used.

Step 2: Scrambling and basic midamble code identification
In the second step, the UE receives the midamble of the P-CCPCH, which is followed by the DwPTS. Each DwPTS code corresponds to a group of four different basic midamble codes, totaling 128 non-overlapping midamble codes. The basic midamble code number divided by four gives the SYNC-DL code number. Once the SYNC-DL is detected, the UE can determine the four basic midamble codes used and identify the correct basic midamble code through a trial and error technique. The same basic midamble code is used throughout the frame, and each basic midamble code is associated with a scrambling code.

Step 3: Control multi-frame synchronisation
In the third step, the UE searches for the Master Indication Block (MIB) of the multi-frame of the BCH in the P-CCPCH, indicated by QPSK phase modulation of the DwPTS with respect to the P-CCPCH midamble. The control multi-frame is positioned by a sequence of QPSK symbols modulated on the DwPTS. A sufficient number of consecutive DwPTS are needed to detect the current position in the control multi-frame.

Step 4: Read the BCH
In the final step, the UE reads the broadcast information of the found cell in one or several BCHs. Depending on the result, the UE may move back to previous steps or complete the initial cell search.

For Dedicated Carrier MBSFN, the initial SFN cell search procedure also involves four steps:

Step 1: Search for PP,even
The UE uses the PP,even in the MS burst to acquire synchronization to an SFN cell.

Step 2: Multi-frame synchronization
The UE searches for the PP,odd in the MS burst to determine the beginning position of the multi-frame of the PCCPCH. Based on the result, the UE may proceed to the next step or return to step 1.

Step 3: Read the BCCH
The UE reads the MIB of the multi-frame P-CCPCHs in the BCH to obtain the system information of the found SFN cell. Depending on the result, the UE may proceed to the next step or return to step 2.

Step 4: Read the MCCH
The UE reads the MCCH indicated by the BCCH information. Depending on the result, the UE may move back to previous steps or complete the initial cell search.","The answer must include:
  - A clear and concise overview of the initial cell search procedure for 1.28Mcps TDD.
  - Detailed descriptions of each of the four steps in the initial cell search procedure, explaining the purpose and actions taken in each step.
  - An explanation of the Dedicated Carrier MBSFN initial SFN cell search procedure, including the four steps involved and their specific functions."
"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the GLR handles the Message-Waiting service element, including the setting and clearing of MNRF and MNRG flags, and the initiation of Alert-SC operations.","The Message-Waiting service element is defined to manage notifications for mobile terminated short messages when the mobile station (MS) is temporarily unavailable or has memory capacity issues. The GLR (Gateway Location Register) plays a crucial role in handling this service element by managing the MNRF (Mobile Not Reachable Flag) and MNRG (Mobile Not Reachable for GPRS Flag) flags.

The setting of MNRF and MNRG flags in the GLR is mandatory, similar to their setting in the VLR (Visitor Location Register) and SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node). These flags are updated under specific conditions:
- MNRF is set when a mobile terminated short message delivery fails due to the MS being temporarily absent (e.g., IMSI DETACH flag is set or no response to a paging request via the MSC).
- MNRG is set when a mobile terminated short message delivery fails due to the MS being temporarily absent (e.g., GPRS DETACH flag is set or no response to a paging request via the SGSN).
- MNRF is cleared when a mobile terminated short message delivery fails due to the MS memory capacity via the MSC being exceeded.
- MNRG is cleared when a mobile terminated short message delivery fails due to the MS memory capacity via the SGSN being exceeded.

When the MS becomes active, the VLR or SGSN sends the 'MS Reachable' message to the HLR (Home Location Register) via the GLR, and the GLR then clears the MNRF or MNRG flags. The GLR must relay the 'MS Reachable' message to the HLR and clear the flags accordingly.

The initiation of Alert-SC (Service Center) operations by the HLR occurs when the HLR detects that the MS has recovered operation or has memory capacity available to receive short messages. Upon receiving the 'MS Reachable' message from the GLR, the HLR invokes operations to alert the SCs within the Message-Waiting Data (MWD). Once these operations are invoked, the MNRF and MNRG flags are cleared in the VLR, SGSN, and GLR.

Specific procedures related to the GLR introduction include sending 'MS Reachable' messages to the HLR when the GLR receives Update Location or Update GPRS Location messages from the VLR or SGSN, provided the MNRF or MNRG flags are set in the GLR. This enables the HLR to initiate Alert-SC operations.

In summary, the GLR handles the Message-Waiting service element by managing the MNRF and MNRG flags, relaying 'MS Reachable' messages to the HLR, and facilitating the initiation of Alert-SC operations to ensure timely delivery of short messages to the MS.","The answer should include:
- The definition and role of the Message-Waiting service element.
- The mandatory setting of MNRF and MNRG flags in the GLR.
- The conditions under which MNRF and MNRG flags are set or cleared.
- The procedure for sending 'MS Reachable' messages from the GLR to the HLR.
- The initiation of Alert-SC operations by the HLR upon receiving 'MS Reachable' messages.
- Specific procedures related to the GLR introduction."
Describe the priority handling and multiple frame operation procedures for data links in 3GPP TS 44.005.,"In 3GPP TS 44.005, the priority handling and multiple frame operation procedures for data links are detailed as follows:

1. **Priority Handling**:
   - **On SDCCH (Standalone Dedicated Control Channel)**:
     - The highest priority is assigned to SAPI (Service Access Point Identifier) = 0.
     - The lowest priority is assigned to SAPI = 3.
   - **On SACCH (Slow Associated Control Channel)**:
     - The priority arrangement ensures that if a SAPI = 3 frame is awaiting transmission, two SAPI = 0 frames are not sent consecutively. An exception is made when Repeated SACCH is supported, allowing a SACCH block containing a SAPI = 0 frame to be repeated in the next SACCH period.
     - For the mobile to network direction, it must be ensured that any SAPI = 3 frame is followed by at least one SAPI = 0 frame.

2. **Multiple Frame Operation**:
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Provides a data link connection for acknowledged information transfer of layer 3 message units.
     - Identifies data link connection endpoints for layer 3 entities.
     - Maintains sequence integrity of data link layer message units.
     - Notifies the peer entity in case of errors, such as loss of sequence.
     - Notifies the layer 3 entity of unrecoverable errors detected by the data link layer.
     - Implements flow control.
     - Sends frames according to the indicated SAPI value.
     - Manages segmentation and concatenation control functions.
     - Suspends service during channel changes and resumes service on the new channel without message loss (SAPI = 0 only).
     - Allows prioritization of messages with preemption of low priority messages by high priority messages (SAPI = 0 only).

   - **Primitives**:
     - **Data Transfer**: DL-DATA-REQUEST/INDICATION for sending and receiving message units.
     - **Establishment**: DL-ESTABLISH-REQUEST/INDICATION/CONFIRM for establishing multiple frame operation.
     - **Suspension**: DL-SUSPEND-REQUEST/CONFIRM for suspending multiple frame operation during channel changes.
     - **Resumption**: DL-RESUME-REQUEST/CONFIRM for resuming multiple frame operation after suspension.
     - **Restoration**: DL-RECONNECT-REQUEST/CONFIRM for restoring multiple frame operation after a failed channel change.
     - **Termination**: DL-RELEASE-REQUEST/INDICATION/CONFIRM for terminating multiple frame operation.

3. **Handling Multiple SAPIs on a Channel**:
   - This procedure is required if more than one SAPI is supported on a channel associated with a specific MS (Mobile Station).
   - It analyzes the address field of a received frame and the type of physical channel, then distributes the frames to the appropriate data link procedure block.
   - On frame transmission, it delivers the frames to the required channel after layer 3 establishes the association between the channel and its physical parameters.
   - It resolves conflicts between various data link procedure blocks on the same physical channel based on the SAPI and the priority requested by layer 3.

These procedures ensure efficient and prioritized handling of data links, maintaining the integrity and reliability of information transfer in mobile communication systems.","The answer should include the priority rules for data links on SDCCH and SACCH, the characteristics of acknowledged multiple frame operation, and the associated primitives. It should also cover the procedure for handling multiple SAPIs on a channel, including how frames are distributed and conflicts resolved based on SAPI and priority."
"Describe the procedure for updating the ACR status using the ACR Status Update Request in 3GPP TS 29.558, including the handling of redirection and the data structures involved.","The ACR Status Update Request procedure in 3GPP TS 29.558 enables a service consumer, either S-EAS or T-EAS, to request an update to the EES regarding the ACR status. The service consumer initiates this process by sending an HTTP POST request to the UAE Server. The request URI is formatted as '{apiRoot}/eees-acrstatus-update/<apiVersion>/request-acrupdate', and the request body includes the ACRUpdateData data structure defined in clause 8.9.6.2.2.

Upon receiving the HTTP POST request, the EES checks whether the service consumer is authorized to update the ACR status. If the authorization is successful, the EES responds with an HTTP '200 OK' status code, including the feedback within the ACRDataStatus data structure defined in clause 8.9.6.2.3, or an HTTP '204 No Content' status code. If the authorization fails, the EES returns an appropriate HTTP error status code along with additional error information in the response body.

In cases where the EES determines that the HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, it may respond with an HTTP '307 Temporary Redirect' or '308 Permanent Redirect' status code. The response includes a 'Location' header containing the URI of an alternative EES endpoint where the message should be redirected. The handling of redirection is further detailed in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122, which specifies that upon receipt of a redirect response, the service consumer should send the HTTP request to the new target URI provided in the 'Location' header.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The role of the service consumer (S-EAS or T-EAS) in initiating the ACR Status Update Request.
  - The specific HTTP POST request format, including the URI and the ACRUpdateData data structure.
  - The authorization check performed by the EES upon receiving the request.
  - The possible HTTP response codes and their meanings (200 OK, 204 No Content, error codes).
  - The definition and role of the ACRDataStatus data structure in the response body.
  - The conditions under which redirection occurs and the handling of '307 Temporary Redirect' and '308 Permanent Redirect' responses, including the use of the 'Location' header field."
"Describe the assistance provided by the GNSS receiver in calculating satellite position and clock offsets, including the role of SSR Orbit and Clock Corrections.","The GNSS receiver receives assistance in calculating satellite position and clock offsets through various models and corrections. Ephemeris and Clock Models assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters necessary to calculate the GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. These models support different parameters and formats as defined by individual GNSSs, ensuring compatibility with various GNSS systems.

SSR Orbit Corrections play a crucial role by providing parameters for orbit corrections in radial, along-track, and cross-track components. These corrections help compute a satellite position correction that is combined with the satellite position calculated from broadcast ephemeris. The orbit corrections define an offset between the broadcast ephemeris orbit and a satellite antenna reference point (ARP), ensuring a consistent solution when all corrections are used together. For integrity purposes, SSR Orbit Corrections also provide the correlation time for orbit error and orbit error rate, along with the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Orbit Error and its associated error rate. Additionally, SSR Orbit Corrections include the satellite and constellation residual risks, which aggregate residual risks for the satellite or constellation Signal in Space, excluding atmospheric effects.

SSR Clock Corrections provide the GNSS receiver with parameters to compute the GNSS satellite clock correction applied to the broadcast satellite clock. These corrections are described by a polynomial of order 2, which includes clock offset, drift, and drift rate for a certain time period. For integrity purposes, SSR Clock Corrections also provide the correlation time for clock error and clock error rate, along with the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Clock Error and its associated error rate.

Overall, the assistance provided by Ephemeris and Clock Models, SSR Orbit Corrections, and SSR Clock Corrections ensures accurate calculation of satellite position and clock offsets, while maintaining integrity through defined bounds and residual risk assessments.","The answer should include details on how Ephemeris and Clock Models assistance helps in calculating satellite position and clock offsets, the role of SSR Orbit Corrections in providing orbit correction parameters and integrity bounds, and the role of SSR Clock Corrections in providing clock correction parameters and integrity bounds. It should also mention the correlation time, mean, and standard deviation for both orbit and clock errors."
Describe the process and requirements for service authorization in MCPTT as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 and TS 33.180.,"The process and requirements for service authorization in Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 and TS 33.180 involve several key steps and elements. 

Firstly, the MCPTT server obtains service authorization information from SIP REGISTER requests sent by the MCPTT client. This information is included in the body of a third-party SIP REGISTER request. The SIP REGISTER request contains important elements such as <mcptt-access-token> and <mcptt-client-id> within a message/sip MIME body.

Upon receiving a third-party SIP REGISTER request, the MCPTT server follows these steps:
1. Identifies the IMS public user identity from the third-party SIP REGISTER request.
2. Identifies the MCPTT ID from the SIP REGISTER request sent by the MCPTT client, following procedures outlined in clause 7.3.1A.
3. Checks if the maximum number of simultaneous authorizations for the MCPTT user is specified in the <user-max-simultaneous-authorizations> element of the <anyExt> element in the <OnNetwork> element of the MCPTT user profile. If this limit is reached, the server does not proceed with further steps.
4. If the <user-max-simultaneous-authorizations> element is not present, the server checks the <max-simultaneous-authorizations> element in the MCPTT service configuration document. If this limit is reached, the server does not proceed with further steps.
5. Performs service authorization for the identified MCPTT ID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180.
6. If service authorization is successful, binds the MCPTT ID and the MCPTT client ID to the IMS public user identity. If the user is already authorized on another MCPTT client, the server keeps the current bindings and creates a new binding.
7. Stores the binding information (MCPTT ID, MCPTT client ID, IMS public user identity, and server identifier) in an external database.
8. If a Resource-Share header field with the value ","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how the MCPTT server obtains service authorization information from SIP REGISTER and SIP PUBLISH requests.

  - Reference to TS 33.180 for detailed service authorization procedures."
"Describe the roles and interactions of the Short Message Transfer Layer (SM-TL) and Short Message Relay Layer (SM-RL) in the context of short message services, including the key protocols and identifiers involved.","The Short Message Transfer Layer (SM-TL) and Short Message Relay Layer (SM-RL) play crucial roles in the architecture of short message services. The SM-TL provides services to the Short Message Application Layer (SM-AL), enabling it to transfer short messages to its peer entity, receive short messages from its peer entity, and receive reports about earlier requests for short messages to be transferred. To keep track of these messages and reports, the SM-TL uses a Short Message Identifier (SMI), which is a reference number for the message associated with the primitive. This SMI is mapped to and from the Short Message Identifier used between the SM-TL and the SM-RL, although it is not carried between entities, meaning a given message may have different SMIs at the Mobile Station (MS) and Short Message Service Center (SC) sides.

The SM-RL provides services to the SM-TL, enabling it to send Transfer Protocol Data Units (TPDUs) to its peer entity, receive TPDUs from its peer entity, and receive reports about earlier requests for TPDUs to be transferred. Similar to the SM-TL, the SM-RL uses a Short Message Identifier (SMI) to keep track of TPDUs and reports. This SMI is carried via the relay layer service between the SC and Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) and between the visited Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and MS, but it is mapped to and from the TCAP dialogue Identifier at the GMSC and the visited MSC.

The SM-RL comprises several protocol elements, each serving specific functions in the context of short message services. These include:
- RP-MO-DATA: for transferring a TPDU from MS to SC
- RP-MT-DATA: for transferring a TPDU from SC to MS
- RP-ACK: for acknowledging an RP-MO-DATA, an RP-MT-DATA, or an RP-SM-MEMORY-AVAILABLE
- RP-ERROR: for informing of an unsuccessful RP-MO-DATA or RP-MT-DATA transfer attempt
- RP-ALERT-SC: for alerting the SC that the MS has recovered operation (information sent from the Home Location Register (HLR) to the SC)
- RP-SM-MEMORY-AVAILABLE: for notifying the network that the MS has memory available to accept one or more short messages (information sent from the MS to the HLR)

These protocols ensure the efficient transfer and management of short messages within the network, facilitating communication between different entities and layers involved in the short message service architecture.","The answer should cover the roles of SM-TL and SM-RL in the short message service architecture, including their interactions with other layers and entities. It should explain the use of Short Message Identifier (SMI) for tracking messages and reports, and how it is mapped between different layers and entities. Additionally, the answer should detail the specific protocols used by SM-RL, including their functions and the types of information they convey."
How is bidding down prevented during X2-handovers and how are AS protection algorithms selected in eNB changes according to 3GPP specifications?,"Bidding down prevention during X2-handovers and the selection of AS protection algorithms in eNB changes are critical processes defined by 3GPP specifications to ensure secure and efficient handovers.

1. **Role of MME in Verifying UE EPS Security Capabilities**:
   During an X2-handover, the Mobility Management Entity (MME) plays a crucial role in verifying the UE EPS security capabilities. The MME must ensure that the security capabilities received from the target eNB match those stored in the MME. This verification helps prevent bidding down attacks, where an attacker might attempt to downgrade the security algorithms used.

2. **Process of Transferring UE EPS Security Capabilities**:
   The process begins with the source eNB including the UE EPS security capabilities and the ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source cell in the handover request message. The target eNB then selects the highest priority algorithm from the UE EPS security capabilities based on its locally configured list. These selected algorithms are indicated to the UE in the handover command if they differ from those used by the source eNB.

3. **Actions Taken by MME in Case of Mismatch**:
   If the MME detects a mismatch between the received UE EPS security capabilities and those stored, it sends its locally stored capabilities to the target eNB in response to the path-switch message. Additionally, the MME may log the event and take further measures, such as raising an alarm. The target eNB then updates the AS security context of the UE with the capabilities received from the MME and selects the highest priority algorithm from these capabilities.

4. **Selection of AS Protection Algorithms by Target eNB**:
   The target eNB selects the AS protection algorithms with the highest priority from the UE EPS security capabilities according to its locally configured prioritized list. This selection applies to both integrity and ciphering algorithms. If the selected algorithms differ from those currently used, the target eNB may take appropriate actions to switch to the new algorithms.

5. **Indication of Selected Algorithms to UE**:
   The chosen algorithms are indicated to the UE in the handover command if they differ from those used by the source eNB. This ensures that the UE is aware of the new security algorithms to be used post-handover.

6. **Verification Steps and Expected Results**:
   Verification involves several steps:
   - The target eNB sends the path-switch message to the MME, including the UE EPS security capabilities.
   - The MME logs any mismatch events.
   - The target eNB selects the highest priority AS algorithms and includes them in the handover command.
   - The UE verifies the message authentication code on the handover command and the MAC in the handover complete message.
   - The AS integrity protection algorithm is selected and applied correctly.

   Expected results include successful logging of mismatches by the MME, correct selection and indication of AS algorithms by the target eNB, and proper verification and application of these algorithms by the UE.

These procedures ensure that bidding down is prevented and that the most secure algorithms are selected and applied during eNB changes, maintaining the integrity and security of the handover process.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The role of MME in verifying UE EPS security capabilities during X2-handovers.
2. The process of transferring UE EPS security capabilities from source eNB to target eNB and then to MME.
3. The actions taken by MME in case of a mismatch in UE EPS security capabilities.
4. The selection of AS protection algorithms by the target eNB based on locally configured prioritized lists.
5. The indication of selected algorithms to the UE in the handover command.
6. Verification steps and expected results for ensuring correct algorithm selection and application."
What are the key performance metrics and results for SAIC gain in configuration 1 under both asynchronous and synchronous operations as described in TS 45.903?,"The key performance metrics and results for SAIC gain in configuration 1 under both asynchronous and synchronous operations are detailed in TS 45.903. Under asynchronous operation, configuration 1 is blocking-limited, and the voice performance metric used to characterize the SAIC gain is the satisfied user percentage for the load associated with 2% blocking. The satisfied user percentages for 100% conventional mobiles and 100% SAIC mobiles are shown in Table 7.1, with the percentage gain also indicated as the ratio of the respective satisfied user percentages. Although the SAIC gain is relatively small in blocking-limited conditions, it still provides some improvement in overall user experience.

For synchronous operation, the SAIC gain for configuration 1 is defined differently due to the change in the FER threshold from 2% to 0.6%, which makes the configuration interference-limited for certain loads. The increase in load can then be used to quantify SAIC gain. Figure 7.15 illustrates the percentage of bad quality calls as a function of effective frequency load for three levels of SAIC penetration: 0%, 50%, and 100%. The performance becomes blocking-limited as the load increases, but extrapolating the linear region of each curve to the 2% point provides load estimates for each penetration level: 0% = 6.25 EFL, 50% = 7.3 EFL, and 100% = 8.4 EFL. The resulting gains for 50% and 100% penetrations are 17% and 34%, respectively. Adjusting these gains for asynchronous operation, considering a 24% decrease in performance, the gains are approximately 13% and 26%, respectively. Thus, SAIC provides modest gain even for configuration 1 at this different QoS point.","The answer should include the satisfied user percentage for configuration 1 under asynchronous operation, the SAIC gain in blocking-limited conditions, and the results shown in Table 7.1. It should also cover the different perspective on SAIC gain for configuration 1 under synchronous operation, including the performance metrics shown in Figure 7.15, the percentage decrease in performance from synchronous to asynchronous operation, and the adjusted gains for asynchronous operation."
Explain the considerations and challenges in modeling power variation and phase discontinuity in an asynchronous link level model as described in 3GPP TS 45.903.,"When designing an asynchronous link level model, it is crucial to consider the power variation between different interfering bursts, such as the main and adjacent interferer. These bursts, assuming they are located within a frame and not at a frame boundary, are sent from the same BTS and thus are affected by nearly the same channel conditions, including pathloss, shadowing, and multipath fading. Despite these similar fading conditions, the received power levels of the interfering bursts can differ due to power control and Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) operation. Power control is specifically modeled for the adjacent burst by multiplying it with a coefficient A, which has a distribution given in Table 5-3 and an expected value of 1 in the linear domain to maintain a constant average power level.

Additionally, the relative phase between bursts transmitted from a BTS on a physical channel is not specified, meaning phase continuity cannot be guaranteed. Timeslot durations can vary, being either 156, 156.25, or 157 symbols, which results in phase discontinuities perceived by the mobile device. To model these effects, a random phase change is introduced, modeled as a random process uniformly distributed within a certain range. The complex scaling formed by the phase transition and power control can be seen as a change in channel conditions, posing challenges for some Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) receivers. These combined effects of power variation and phase discontinuity must be carefully considered to ensure accurate modeling and performance evaluation of the asynchronous link level model.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of the importance of modeling power variation and the assumption about bursts being within a frame.
  - Description of how power control is modeled for adjacent bursts using coefficient A and its distribution.
  - Discussion on the lack of phase continuity specification and the impact of varying timeslot durations.
  - Explanation of the random phase change model and its combined effect with power control on channel conditions.

Describe the process and requirements for a UE to decode PSCCH and PSSCH in different sidelink transmission modes according to 3GPP TS 36.213 and TS 36.321 specifications.,"The process and requirements for a User Equipment (UE) to decode Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH) and Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) in different sidelink transmission modes are detailed in the 3GPP TS 36.213 and TS 36.321 specifications.

According to TS 36.213, there are four sidelink transmission modes, each with specific requirements for decoding PSCCH and PSSCH:

1. **Sidelink Transmission Mode 1**:
   - The UE detects SCI format 0 on PSCCH.
   - The UE decodes PSSCH according to the detected SCI format 0.

If the 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth is not defined for the operating band under test, as per TS 36.101 clause 5.6.1, this part of the test is omitted.

The setup involves connecting the SS and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connector(s) as shown in Annex A, Figure A.3a for 4RX capable UE without any 2RX bands, or Figure A.3 otherwise. General test parameter settings are outlined in Table 9.1.3.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to clause 4.7.2.1. The message contents are defined in clause 9.1.3.4.3.

All cells are on the same carrier frequency, with Cell 1 being the serving cell and OTDOA assistance data reference cell, and Cell 2 being the neighbour cell. The assistance data neighbour cell list includes a total of 15 cells, with 14 being dummy cells as defined in TS 37.571-5 clause 7.2.2. The true RSTD values, which represent the receive time difference for frame 0 between cell 2 and cell 1 at the UE antenna connector, are set as follows:

"Describe the ATF measurement procedure, including the accuracy requirements for RSAP and RSARP, the client application for access to the ATF, and the message definitions and contents used for communication between the UE and the test platform.","The ATF measurement procedure is designed for dual antenna single carrier systems, with the intention to extend to quad and octo antenna systems, including carrier aggregation (CA) in the future. The use case for these measurements involves establishing conditions defined in subclause 5.1 of TR 36.978. The test system can request measurements for any arbitrary orientation of the UE relative to the probe antenna, and the UE can be repositioned to sample the required number of points on the sphere. Typically, a 2D cut of the UE is measured at both horizontal and vertical polarizations, and the complex antenna pattern is derived from the reported RSAP and RSARP values, including calibration procedures not covered in the document.

The accuracy requirements for RSAP and RSARP measurements are defined in subclause 5.9.2. The two-stage test method includes validation and linearization of RSAP and RSARP results prior to calibration against known radiated metrology standards. The requirement for RSAP and RSARP is that they are monotonic over a given range and resolution, making their absolute accuracies irrelevant. However, an upper bound limit on accuracy is defined for RSAP to guide its implementation, ensuring it does not increase demands on existing receiver designs.

The client application for access to the ATF, defined in clause 9.1, allows the UE to receive the ANTENNA INFORMATION REQUEST from the Test Platform and respond with the ANTENNA INFORMATION RESPONSE. The application must support the underlying RSAP and RSARP ATF measurements in the device chipset. For data-centric devices, the ATF test application runs on a host laptop, while for phones, notebooks, and tablets, it is embedded by the vendor. Upon launch, the DUT listens on the configured IP address and UDP port, waiting for the test platform to initiate communication. The application includes a user interface for configuring the IP address and port number, which is stored across DUT power cycles. The ANTENNA INFORMATION RESPONSE must be sent within 1 second of the ANTENNA INFORMATION REQUEST.

The message definitions and contents used for communication between the UE and the test platform are outlined in clause 9.1.2. The messages include encoding of date, time, RSAP, and RSARP values. The date is encoded with binary-coded year, month, and day values, while the time is encoded with binary-coded hour, minutes, and seconds values. The RSAP value is encoded in -xxx.xx dBm, multiplied by -100, and binary coded, while the RSARP value is encoded in xxx.xx degrees, multiplied by 100, and binary coded. These definitions ensure accurate and standardized communication between the UE and the test platform.","The answer should cover the ATF measurement procedure, including the conditions for measurements and the derivation of the complex antenna pattern.

   - Upon receiving the request, the VAE-S must check the V2X user authorization to update the group information. If the authorization fails or the updated group information is not valid, the VAE-S must respond with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) response and skip the rest of the steps.

3. **Consent Requirement**:
   - If the update requires consent from other group members, the VAE-S must obtain this consent as specified in clause 6.8.5. This involves generating an HTTP POST request to the VAE-C (Vehicle Application Client) with a Request-URI set to the URI corresponding to the identity of the VAE-C, a Content-Type header set to 'application/vnd.3gpp.vae-info+xml', and a MIME body containing a <dynamic-group-info-update-indication> element within the <VAE-info> root element. This element must include a <dynamic-group-info> element with a <dynamic-group-id>, <group-definition>, and <group-leader-id>.

4. **Generating an HTTP 200 Response**:
   - If the authorization is successful and consent is obtained, the VAE-S must generate an HTTP 200 (OK) response according to IETF RFC 7231. The response must include a Content-Type header set to 'application/vnd.3gpp.vae-info+xml' and a MIME body containing a <dynamic-group-update-info> element within the <VAE-info> root element. This element must include a <result> child element set to 'success' or 'failure' and may include a <suggestion> child element with a <group-leader-id>.

5. **Updating the Group Document**:
   - Finally, the VAE-S must update the group document as specified in clause 6.2.5.1 of TS 24.544.

By following these steps, the VAE-S ensures that dynamic group information in a V2X network is updated in compliance with 3GPP specifications.","The answer must include:
  - The initial conditions for receiving an HTTP POST request and the required headers and MIME body elements.
  - The authorization check process and the handling of failed authorization.

"Describe the process and requirements for deleting a 5GLAN parameters provision subscription and a VAL group document, including the interactions between different network functions and the necessary HTTP methods and responses.","To delete an existing subscription to 5GLAN provision parameters, the Application Function (AF) must initiate an HTTP DELETE request to the Network Exposure Function (NEF) for the 'Individual 5GLAN Parameters Provision Subscription' resource. Upon receiving the HTTP DELETE message, the NEF verifies if the AF is authorized. If authorized, the NEF interacts with the Unified Data Management (UDM) using the Nudm_ParameterProvision service to delete the subscription at the UDM. If the UDM accepts the request and responds successfully, the NEF deletes the subscription and sends an HTTP '204 No Content' response to the AF.

For deleting a VAL group document, the VAL server sends an HTTP DELETE message to the Group Management server targeting its resource representation. The Group Management server first verifies the identity of the VAL server and checks its authorization to delete the VAL group document. If authorized, and if the group communication type is 5GLAN communication, the Group Management server invokes the 5GLANParameterProvision API towards the NEF via an HTTP DELETE message. Subsequently, the Group Management server deletes the resource representation pointed by the group document resource identifier.

The DELETE method for the VAL group document must support specific URI query parameters, request data structures, response data structures, and response codes as outlined in the relevant tables.

Compare the two options for provisioning the operator root certificate in the base station during the CMPv2 protocol run. Discuss the security implications and the preferred option from a Plug and Connect (PnC) perspective.,"There are two options for provisioning the operator root certificate in the base station during the CMPv2 protocol run:

Option 1: The operator root certificate is provisioned in the network element (NE) prior to the CMPv2 protocol run. This method avoids the 'time window of vulnerability' during the CMP initialization, as the certificate is already in place. However, it requires pre-provisioning either in the factory or on-site by service personnel, which introduces the risk of a security leak during the provisioning process within the vendor or commissioning environment.

Option 2: The operator root certificate is provisioned in the NE during the CMPv2 protocol run, as part of the Initialization Response. This method aligns with the Plug and Connect (PnC) principle of minimizing pre-provisioning. However, it carries the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack during the CMP initialization. Such an attack would need to occur timely during the actual CMP initialization run, with the attacker having access to the access network between the NE and the RA/CA. Despite this risk, it is considered acceptable due to the short time window of vulnerability, the closed access networks of many operators, and the fact that most attacks would only lead to the NE's inability to connect to the network or misuse of the new NE by the attacker, which the operator would likely notice and investigate.

From a PnC perspective, Option 2 is more interesting as it minimizes pre-provisioning. However, it is questionable to allow Option 2 in public Internet environments without operator-trusted access networks, where attacks are more probable, and an attacker may install static catching or spoofing equipment to capture initialization requests.

The CMPv2 protocol, as specified in RFC 4210 and RFC 4211, is used for base station enrolment, requiring proof-of-possession methods. The general deployment architecture involves the base station being pre-provisioned with a public-private key pair and a vendor-signed certificate of its public key. Upon initial contact with the operator network, the base station establishes a communication channel to the RA/CA, sends a certificate request using CMPv2, and authenticates messages based on the vendor-signed certificate and the vendor root certificate pre-installed in the network. The base station checks the integrity protection on messages from the RA/CA based on the operator root certificate provisioned in the base station. The operator root certificate can be provisioned prior to or during the CMPv2 protocol run, with the protection of the certificate during provisioning decided by the operator's security policy.

Ultimately, the choice between the two options depends on the network operator's risk assessment and the importance of Plug and Connect.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of the two options for provisioning the operator root certificate (prior to CMPv2 protocol run and during CMPv2 protocol run).
  - Security risks associated with each option, including potential man-in-the-middle attacks and security leaks during provisioning.
  - The importance of minimizing pre-provisioning from a Plug and Connect perspective.
  - The role of CMPv2 protocol in base station enrolment and the proof-of-possession methods.

"Describe the new burst format for Evolved GERAN as proposed in TS 45.912, including the removal of training sequences and guard times, and discuss the implications for RLC/MAC layer and coding schemes.","The new burst format for Evolved GERAN, as proposed in TS 45.912, involves two fundamental changes: the removal of training sequences and the removal of guard times. In a multislot allocation, training sequences are removed from all slots except one, allowing for more efficient use of the available space. For example, in a 3-slot allocation, the training sequence could be retained in the second slot and removed from the first and third slots. Additionally, the stealing flags are removed whenever the training sequence is removed, with the assumption that the remaining stealing flag will apply to the other slots.

Further efficiency is gained by allowing data transmission during the guard period when it falls within two timeslots allocated to the same user. This means the receiver only ramps up before the first slot and ramps down at the end of the last slot, eliminating intermediate ramps and tail bits. This new slot format aggregates the slots of a multislot allocation, resulting in uninterrupted data streams with only one training sequence.

The introduction of this new, larger slot format allows for additional gains at the RLC/MAC layer. Larger radio blocks can be defined, spanning four TDMA frames but consisting of four aggregated slots instead of four ordinary slots. This reduces the need for RLC/MAC headers in every slot, allowing multiple RLC/MAC blocks to be multiplexed in one radio block, similar to the existing MCS7-9 principle.

In the downlink, the removal of RLC/MAC headers from certain timeslots includes the removal of the USF, reducing scheduling opportunities in the uplink. However, in the uplink, there are no USF or RRBP, so these drawbacks do not exist, and the new burst formats can be used whenever at least two adjacent timeslots are allocated to a mobile station.

The new burst format also introduces turbo codes in the aggregated RLC data block, making longer data block lengths before channel coding realistic. New coding schemes, MB3MCS10 and MB3MCS11, are added to reach peak data rates. In MB3MCS1 to MB3MCS9, redundancy bits from burst and RLC aggregation are used as protection bits in coding. The head length and coding schemes of the new MCS types are the same as the legacy MCS in simulations, which include scenarios like co-channel interference and various equalizer types (GMSK: MLSE + PSP (LMS), 8PSK: RSSE + PSP (LMS)).

Simulations have shown that the data throughput gains of new coding schemes with turbo codes are very close to the theoretical gains with aggregated formats at Layer 1 and Layer 2. The average data throughput gains are listed in Table 202, indicating significant improvements with the new coding schemes.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - Explanation of the new burst format including the removal of training sequences and guard times.

Describe the procedures and reference points for using pre-established and dynamic MBMS bearers in MCVideo service as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281.,"The MCVideo service supports the use of both pre-established and dynamic MBMS bearers for group calls, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281.

For pre-established MBMS bearers, the MCVideo service uses the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-8, and MCVideo-9 reference points. The MC service client is the MCVideo client, the MC service server is the MCVideo server, and the MC service ID is the MCVideo ID. Pre-established MBMS bearers can be used for different types of MCVideo group calls, including pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls. These bearers can distribute media packets and transmission control messages to receiving MCVideo clients. Optionally, a separate MBMS bearer may be used for transmission control messages due to different bearer characteristic requirements. The procedure for call connect and disconnect over MBMS is performed by the MCVideo server during the group communication session establishment step.

"What are the key measurements provided in TS 32.426 for monitoring the performance of non-virtualized and virtualized EPC NFs, and how are these measurements obtained and represented?","TS 32.426 provides several key measurements for monitoring the performance of non-virtualized and virtualized EPC Network Functions (NFs). These measurements include:

1. **GTP Data PDUs**: This measurement provides the number of GTP data PDUs on the S1-U interface generated by the GTP-U protocol entity. It involves the transmission by the S-GW of a GTP-U data PDU on the S1-U interface to the eNodeB. The measurement is represented as a single integer value and is valid for packet switching traffic.

2. **Mean Processor Usage**: This measurement provides the mean usage of processors during the granularity period. For non-virtualized Network Elements (NE), it is split into subcounters per key processor, while for virtualized EPC NFs, it provides the mean composite virtual CPU usage of the underlying virtualized compute resources. The measurement is obtained by sampling at predefined intervals and taking the arithmetic mean for non-virtualized NE, and by receiving and mapping measurements from VNFC instances for virtualized EPC NFs. The measurement is represented as an integer value (Unit: %) and the name format is EQPT.MeanProcessorUsage.ProcessorID. It is valid for both circuit switched and packet switched traffic.

3. **Mean Memory Usage**: This measurement provides the mean memory usage during the granularity period. For non-virtualized NE, it is split into subcounters per key memory, while for virtualized EPC NFs, it provides the mean composite virtual memory usage of the underlying virtualized compute resources. The measurement is obtained similarly to processor usage, by sampling at predefined intervals and taking the arithmetic mean for non-virtualized NE, and by receiving and mapping measurements from VNFC instances for virtualized EPC NFs. The measurement is represented as a real value (Unit: %) and the name format is EQPT.MemMeanUsage.MemID. It is valid for packet switched traffic.

4. **Mean Disk Usage**: This measurement provides the mean disk usage during the granularity period. For non-virtualized NE, it is split into subcounters per key disk, while for virtualized EPC NFs, it provides the mean composite virtual disk usage of the underlying virtualized compute resources. The measurement is obtained by sampling at predefined intervals and taking the arithmetic mean for non-virtualized NE, and by receiving and mapping measurements from VNFC instances for virtualized EPC NFs. The measurement is represented as a real value (Unit: %) and the name format is EQPT.DiskMeanUsage.DiskId. It is valid for packet switched traffic.

Describe the procedure for updating traffic steering control information at the TSSF as outlined in TS 29.213 section 4.9.2.,"The procedure for updating traffic steering control information at the Traffic Steering Function (TSSF) involves several steps initiated by the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF). The PCRF determines that the traffic steering control information needs to be updated for the IP-CAN session, which may be due to changes in subscription or the allocation/release of an IPv4 address. The PCRF then sends a Diameter Traffic Steering Request (TSR) command to the TSSF. This command includes the Request-Type Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) set to the value '1' and other necessary parameters as defined in subclauses 4c.4.1 or 4c.4.4 of TS 29.212. Upon receiving the TSR command, the TSSF installs, modifies, or removes the Application Detection and Control (ADC) rules accordingly. Additionally, the TSSF may activate or deactivate these ADC rules. After completing these actions, the TSSF acknowledges the changes by sending a Diameter Traffic Steering Answer (TSA) command back to the PCRF.","The answer should include the conditions under which the PCRF updates traffic steering control information, the type of command sent by the PCRF (Diameter TSR), the specific AVP and its value, the role of the TSSF in installing/modifying/removing ADC rules, and the acknowledgment process via the Diameter TSA command."
"Describe the different session transfer and conference scenarios as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.228, including Blind Transfer, Assured Transfer, and Three-way session.","3GPP TS 23.228 outlines various session transfer and conference scenarios, including Blind Transfer, Assured Transfer, and Three-way session.

Blind Transfer starts with an existing session between the Initiator (I) and the Recipient (R). Typically, this session was initiated by R. The goal is for R to establish a session with the Target (T). I sends a Refer message to R, who then initiates a session with T. Immediately after sending the Refer message, I issues a BYE message to terminate its connection with R.

Assured Transfer is similar to Blind Transfer, but with a key difference: I waits until the Refer message successfully completes before issuing the BYE message to terminate its connection with R. If the new session from R to T fails, R still maintains the session with I.

A Three-way session begins with an existing session between the Initiator (I) and party (A). I places this session on hold and establishes a second session with party (B). To create an ad-hoc conference, I establishes another session with a third-party conference bridge service. The existing sessions, I->A and I->B, are then transferred to the bridge. The conference bridge service controls the termination sequence. Upon termination of one of the three sessions, the bridge may either terminate the other two sessions or use the procedures of Blind Transfer to transfer one of the remaining endpoints to the other, resulting in a simple two-party session.

These scenarios illustrate the flexibility and control mechanisms available for managing session transfers and conferences in a telecommunications network.","The answer should include:
  - Definitions and differences between Blind Transfer and Assured Transfer.

"Explain the interleaving process for coded bits in the context of 3GPP TS 45.003, including the conversion of bits into symbols and the specific interleaving rules applied.","The interleaving process for coded bits in the context of 3GPP TS 45.003 involves two main steps: the conversion of bits into symbols and the application of specific interleaving rules.

Firstly, before interleaving, the bits {PC'(0) … PC'(1367)} are converted into 3-bit symbols {c(0) … c(455)}. This conversion is done according to table 1 in 3GPP TS 45.004. The symbol c(k) consists of three bits: d3k=PC'(k), d3k+1=PC'(k+456), and d3k+2=PC'(k+912) for k=0,1,…,456. This step ensures that the bits are grouped into symbols, which are then interleaved using the existing interleaving tables, but with symbols instead of single bits.

Secondly, the interleaving of the coded bits follows a specific rule as detailed in TS 45.003 3.1.3. The coded bits are reordered and interleaved according to the formula:
i(B,j) = c(n,k), for k = 0,1,...,455
n = 0,1,...,N,N+1,...
B = B0 + 4n + (k mod 8)
j = 2((49k) mod 57) + ((k mod 8) div 4)

This rule results in the distribution of the reordered 456 bits of a given data block, n = N, over 8 blocks using the even numbered bits of the first 4 blocks (B = B0 + 4N + 0, 1, 2, 3) and odd numbered bits of the last 4 blocks (B = B0 + 4N + 4, 5, 6, 7). The reordered bits of the following data block, n = N+1, use the even numbered bits of the blocks B = B0 + 4N + 4, 5, 6, 7 (B = B0 + 4(N+1) + 0, 1, 2, 3) and the odd numbered bits of the blocks B = B0 + 4(N+1) + 4, 5, 6, 7. This method, known as block diagonal interleaving, ensures that one block always carries 57 bits of data from one data block (n = N) and 57 bits of data from the next block (n = N+1), with the bits from the data block with the higher number being the even numbered data bits, and those from the data block with the lower number being the odd numbered bits.

Describe the scenarios studied regarding GSM backwards compatibility issues due to the deployment of CTS-FPs in the PLMN coverage area.,"The study of GSM backwards compatibility issues due to the deployment of CTS-FPs in the PLMN coverage area is divided into three scenarios:

1. Scenario 1: In this scenario, CTS is not operated by the PLMN operator, or CTS and GSM are operated in separate frequency bands.

As a result, there is no interference between the two systems, and the GSM-MS behavior remains unaffected by the presence of CTS-FPs.

2. Scenario 2: Here, CTS and GSM are operated in a shared frequency band with an optimal GFL (Guard Frequency List) definition for the considered area. This means that at every given location within the overlapping coverage area, the PLMN and CTS-GFL do not share any common frequencies. This optimal frequency planning ensures minimal interference, allowing the GSM-MS to function properly without significant impact from CTS-FPs.

3. Scenario 3: In this scenario, CTS and GSM are operated in a shared frequency band with a sub-optimal GFL definition for some areas. This implies that at certain locations within the overlapping coverage area, the PLMN and CTS-GFL (and possibly FPs) share common frequencies. This can lead to potential interference, affecting the GSM-MS behavior. The GSM-MS may experience issues such as degraded signal quality or connectivity problems due to the overlapping frequencies.

These scenarios highlight the importance of frequency planning and management to ensure compatibility and minimize interference between GSM and CTS systems within a PLMN coverage area.","The answer should include a detailed description of each scenario: Scenario 1 where CTS and GSM are operated in separate bands, Scenario 2 where CTS and GSM share a band with optimal GFL definition, and Scenario 3 where CTS and GSM share a band with sub-optimal GFL definition. Additionally, it should explain the implications of these scenarios on GSM-MS behavior in a PLMN coverage area."
"Describe the procedures for group call setup and management between the MCPTT system and the LMR system as defined in 3GPP TS 23.283, including encryption techniques and late entry procedures.","The procedures for group call setup and management between the MCPTT (Mission Critical Push-To-Talk) system and the LMR (Land Mobile Radio) system as defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 involve several key aspects:

1. **Group Call Setup**:
   - The setup of group calls between the MCPTT system and the LMR system can occur on interworking groups defined in either the MCPTT system or the LMR system. Specifically, subclauses 10.3.3.2 and 10.3.3.3 describe the setup for interworking groups defined in the MCPTT system, while subclauses 10.3.3.4 and 10.3.3.5 cover the setup for interworking groups defined in the LMR system.

2. **Types of Group Calls**:
   - The procedures are applicable to non-broadcast group call types, including pre-configured group regroup calls, pre-configured user regroup calls, and group regroup calls.

3. **Encryption Techniques**:
   - Group calls can utilize MC media encryption between the Interworking Function (IWF) and the MCPTT clients, as described in 3GPP TS 33.180. Additionally, calls using an LMR vocoder may employ LMR End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) if the calling and called parties have been provisioned with the appropriate LMR E2EE keys. It is important to note that MC media encryption is independent of LMR E2EE techniques, and both encryption methods can be applied simultaneously.

4. **Late Entry Procedures**:
   - Subclause 10.3.3.7 details the procedures for late entry into an ongoing group call. This allows users who were not initially part of the call to join it after it has started.

5. **Group Call Release Procedures**:
   - Subclause 10.3.3.8 describes the procedures for releasing a group call, ensuring that the call is properly terminated and resources are freed.

These procedures ensure seamless interworking and secure communication between MCPTT and LMR systems, accommodating various types of group calls and providing robust encryption options.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The process of setting up group calls between the MCPTT system and the LMR system, including the distinction between interworking groups defined in the MCPTT system and those defined in the LMR system.
  - The types of group calls that the procedures apply to (pre-configured group regroup calls, pre-configured user regroup calls, group regroup calls).
  - The use of MC media encryption and its independence from LMR E2EE techniques, including the possibility of using both encryption methods simultaneously.
  - The procedures for late entry into an ongoing group call.
  - The procedures for releasing a group call."
Describe the configuration and usage of URIs and numbers for session transfer in 3GPP specifications.,"In 3GPP specifications, the configuration and usage of URIs and numbers for session transfer are detailed across several documents. 

The SC Transfer URI (STI) is defined in TS 24.216 5.11 as the URI that the user includes in SIP INVITE requests to initiate session transfer. It occurs once, is in character format, and can be accessed for getting or replacing. The format of the SC STI is defined by 3GPP TS 23.003, and an example is sip:domain.xfer@dtf1.home1.net.

The SC Transfer Number (STN) is specified in TS 24.216 5.12 as the number included in a circuit-switched call setup to initiate session transfer. Similar to the STI, it occurs once, is in character format, and can be accessed for getting or replacing. The format of the SC STN is also defined by 3GPP TS 23.003, with an example being +12125555555.

The PS to PS STI URI, as described in TS 24.216 5.30, is used in 3GPP TS 24.237. It occurs once, is in character format, and can be accessed for getting or replacing. The value is a SIP URI.

TS 24.237 4.3 outlines the configuration for session transfer, including:
- The SC UE (User Equipment) is configured with a static STI and STN for access transfer, as per TS 24.216 5.11 and 5.12, respectively. The static STI is used for CS to PS access transfer when no dynamically assigned STI is available, and the static STN is used for PS to CS access transfer when no service control signaling path is available.
- The SC UE is reachable in both the IM CN subsystem and the CS domain by one or more public telecommunication numbers, which should be correlated between the two domains.
- The SCC AS (Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server) is configured with various URIs and numbers for session transfer, including STN-SR, additional transferred session SCC AS URIs, ATU-STI for PS to CS and CS to PS SRVCC, PS to PS STI, and dynamic STN.
- The ATCF (Access Transfer Control Function) is configured with STN-SR, ATCF URIs for originating and terminating requests, ATCF management URI, and ATCF URI for anchoring additionally transferred calls.
- The MSC server enhanced for ICS and supporting CS to PS SRVCC is configured with MSC URIs for redirected terminating sessions and MSC server management URI.

These configurations ensure that session transfer can be effectively managed across different network domains and scenarios, providing seamless service continuity for users.","The answer should include the definitions and formats of SC Transfer URI (STI) and SC Transfer Number (STN) as specified in TS 24.216. It should also cover the PS to PS STI URI usage as per TS 24.237. Additionally, the configuration details for SC UE, SCC AS, ATCF, and MSC server for session transfer, including the static and dynamic URIs and numbers, should be explained comprehensively."
Explain the process and requirements for packet header information reporting in 5G networks as described in the 3GPP TS 33.128 and TS 33.127 documents.,"The process and requirements for packet header information reporting in 5G networks are detailed in the 3GPP TS 33.128 and TS 33.127 documents. Packet header information reporting involves two types of Intercept Related Information (IRI) messages: Packet Data Header Reporting (PDHR) and Packet Data Summary Reporting (PDSR). These messages are generated using two approaches.

In approach 1, the IRI-POI present in the User Plane (UP) Entity constructs and delivers the packet header information reporting related xIRIs to the MDF2. In approach 2, the CC-POI present in the UP Entity intercepts, constructs, and delivers the xCC to the MDF3, which then forwards the xCC to the MDF2 over the LI_MDF interface. The MDF2 generates the IRI messages containing the packet header information reporting related records from the xCC. The payload of the PDHR and PDSR records are described in specific clauses and tables within the documents.

The CC-POI in the UPF sends xCC over LI_X3 for each IP packet matching the criteria specified in the Triggering message received over LI_T3 from the CC-TF in the SMF. The payload format types include IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, and GTP-U, with mandatory support for GTP-U packet delivery.

The IRI-TF in the SMF plays a crucial role in sending activation, modification, and deactivation messages to the IRI-POI in the UPF. When a PDU session is established, modified, or released, the IRI-TF sends the appropriate message over the LI_T2 interface, using a correlation ID to ensure proper tracking and reporting.

The selection of UPF to provide the IRI-POI functions is done similarly to the selection for CC-POI functions. The completeness and non-duplication requirements are referenced in TS 33.127 clause 7.12.2, ensuring that all necessary packet header information is accurately reported without redundancy.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of the two approaches for generating IRI messages (approach 1 and approach 2)
  - Description of PDHR and PDSR IRI messages and their payload details
  - Role and actions of MDF2 and MDF3 in packet header information reporting
  - Criteria and process for sending xCC over LI_X3 by CC-POI in UPF
  - Different payload format types and mandatory support for GTP-U packet delivery
  - Role of IRI-TF in SMF and the process for sending activation, modification, and deactivation messages to IRI-POI in UPF

Describe the actions a UE must take upon receiving various GANSS-related IEs in idle or connected mode according to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications.,"According to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications, when a UE (User Equipment) is in idle or connected mode and supports GANSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) location services, it must store and act upon various GANSS-related Information Elements (IEs) included in the system information block. The specific actions for each IE are as follows:

1. **Reference Position**: The UE must act upon the received IE 'Reference position' as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.7.8. This involves storing the IE in the variable UE_POSITIONING_GANSS_DATA and using it as a priori knowledge of the approximate location of the UE.

2. **GANSS Reference Time**: The UE must act upon the received IE 'GANSS reference time' as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.7.7. This includes storing various sub-IEs such as 'GANSS Day', 'GANSS Day Cycle Number', 'GANSS TOD', 'GANSS TOD Uncertainty', 'GANSS Time ID', 'SFN', 'UTRAN GANSS timing of cell frames', 'Primary CPICH Info', 'cell parameters id', and 'TUTRAN-GANSS drift rate' in the variable UE_POSITIONING_GANSS_DATA. The UE uses these sub-IEs for time-related estimations and calculations, such as determining the current GANSS day, estimating GANSS Time-of-Day, and estimating the relationship between GANSS time and air-interface timing of the NODE B transmission.

3. **GANSS Ionospheric Model**: If the IE 'GANSS ionospheric model' is included, the UE must act upon it as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.7.5. This involves storing the IE in the variable UE_POSITIONING_GANSS_DATA and acting on the ionospheric model parameters as specified.

4. **GANSS Additional Ionospheric Model**: If the IE 'GANSS additional ionospheric model' is included, the UE must act upon it as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.7.12. This involves storing the IE in the variable UE_POSITIONING_GANSS_DATA and acting on the additional ionospheric model parameters as specified.

5. **GANSS Earth Orientation Parameters**: If the IE 'GANSS Earth orientation parameters' is included, the UE must act upon it as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.7.13. This involves storing the IE in the variable UE_POSITIONING_GANSS_DATA and acting on the Earth orientation parameters as specified.

The UE must perform these actions to ensure accurate positioning and timing estimations based on the received GANSS-related IEs, taking into account any conditional actions based on the inclusion of sub-IEs and the UE's state (idle or connected).","The answer should comprehensively cover the specific actions the UE must take for each GANSS-related IE mentioned in the documents. This includes storing the IEs in the appropriate variables, acting on the parameters as specified, and using the information for positioning and timing estimations. The answer should also highlight any conditional actions based on the inclusion of sub-IEs and the UE's state (idle or connected)."
"How does the 3GPP TS 46.021 standard handle unreliable frames in speech transmission, and what mechanisms are used to improve the subjective quality of speech?","The 3GPP TS 46.021 standard addresses the handling of unreliable frames in speech transmission through several mechanisms. Firstly, the usability of a frame is determined by investigating its parameter properties. If a frame is deemed unusable, the BFI (Bad Frame Indicator) flag is set, and substitution and muting are performed to mitigate the impact of the unusable frame (Document 1). 

When the BFI flag is set (BFI='1'), it indicates a lost speech or SID (Silence Descriptor) frame. Normal decoding of these frames would degrade the subjective quality of speech. To improve the subjective quality, the frame parameters are modified before the speech decoder functions are executed (Document 2).

For error detection, the parameter R0, which represents the average signal energy, is used. This parameter typically shows smooth behavior from frame to frame, except at the beginning or end of a talk spurt. The difference between the R0 value of the current frame and the last good frame is computed. If this difference exceeds a threshold, the frame is marked as unreliable and declared unusable by setting the BFI flag to '1' (Document 3).

In summary, the standard employs a combination of frame parameter investigation, BFI flag setting, parameter modification, and threshold-based error detection using the R0 parameter to handle unreliable frames and enhance the subjective quality of speech.","The answer should include the criteria for determining frame usability, the role of the BFI flag in identifying unusable frames, the impact of lost frames on speech quality, and the methods used to modify frame parameters to enhance speech quality. Additionally, it should cover the use of the R0 parameter for error detection and the threshold mechanism for marking frames as unreliable."
Describe the procedures and attributes involved in media plane optimization for WebRTC as specified in 3GPP documents.,"Media plane optimization procedures for WebRTC are designed to convey media between WebRTC clients without bearer level protocol conversion. When both ends are WebRTC IMS clients (WIC), the eIMS-AGWs remain allocated but media plane interworking is disabled, except when lawful interception (LI) is needed. Depending on the configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG), the eIMS-AGW forwards all protocol layers either including DTLS or on top of DTLS transparently. Terminating the DTLS protocol layer for all calls can improve the transparency of LI. In Rel-13, the procedure supports transparent forwarding of all protocol layers including DTLS, and no related configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG) is required. The configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG) needs to consider if the eIMS-AGW supports media plane optimization procedures with DTLS layer termination added in Rel-14.

The SDP attributes associated with WebRTC media plane optimization procedures include ","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The purpose and procedures of media plane optimization for WebRTC as described in TS 23.334.
- The role of eIMS-AGWs and DTLS protocol layer handling in media plane optimization.

"Explain the conditions under which a HARQ Failure Indication is sent by the serving Node B to the SRNC, and describe the relevant information elements involved in this process, including the UL Mux Info IE.","The serving Node B sends a HARQ Failure Indication to the SRNC under specific conditions related to the unsuccessful decoding of the E-DCH payload. These conditions include:
- When a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not been successfully decoded, and the RSN (and HARQ process ID for TDD) indicates the transmission of a new MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for the same HARQ process, and the number of HARQ retransmissions is equal to or higher than the lowest of the maximum HARQ retransmissions values for the UE’s configured MAC-d flows.
- When a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not been successfully decoded, and the maximum retransmissions for the MAC-d flow with the highest maximum HARQ retransmissions value valid for the UE connection have occurred, or should have occurred if the HARQ related outband signalling (RSN) on the E-DPCCH (FDD) or E-UCCH (TDD) could not be decoded.
- When a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not been successfully decoded during the MAC-e or MAC-i Reset performed in the UE, with the Node B knowing the timing of the reset via higher layer signaling.

The HARQ Failure Indication is sent on only one transport bearer, which the Node B may select from any of the transport bearers associated with the UE for which the HARQ failure relates to. In Multi Cell E-DCH operation, the Node B may select any transport bearer associated with the UE and include UL Mux Info to indicate the frequency (primary or secondary UL frequency) where the HARQ failure occurred.

The relevant information elements (IEs) involved in the HARQ Failure Indication include:
- CFN and Subframe Number IE values, which reflect the time when the failure was detected.
- Number of MAC-es PDUs IE, set to zero, resulting in no DDI and N IEs in the header and 4 bits padding for octet alignment, with no MAC-es PDUs IEs in the payload.
- Number of MAC-is PDUs IE, set to zero, resulting in no MAC-is PDU descriptor IE and no MAC-is PDUs IEs in the payload.
- Number of HARQ Retransmissions IE, set to the number of HARQ retransmissions that occurred when the failure was detected, coded as described for a correctly decoded payload.
- UL Mux Info IE, indicating the frequency (primary UL frequency = 0, secondary UL frequency = 1) in which the failure was detected in Multi Cell E-DCH operation, as described in subclause 6.2.4.21.

The UL Mux Info IE is particularly significant in Multi Cell E-DCH operation, as it differentiates between the primary and secondary UL frequencies, ensuring accurate identification of the frequency where the HARQ failure occurred.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The specific conditions under which the serving Node B sends a HARQ Failure Indication to the SRNC.
  - The selection criteria for the transport bearer used to send the HARQ Failure Indication.
  - The values and descriptions of the relevant information elements (IEs) involved in the HARQ Failure Indication, including CFN, Subframe Number, Number of MAC-es PDUs, Number of MAC-is PDUs, Number of HARQ Retransmissions, and UL Mux Info.

What are the requirements and conditions for TDD RSRP measurements as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and related documents?,"The requirements and conditions for TDD RSRP measurements are defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and related documents. The intra frequency absolute accuracy requirements for TDD RSRP measurements are specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.3. These requirements are valid under several conditions: the cell-specific reference signals in the measured cell must be transmitted from one, two, or four antenna ports; the conditions defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity must be fulfilled; the RSRP must be measured according to Annex I.3.9 for the corresponding band; the time domain measurement resource restriction pattern configured for the measured cell must indicate at least one subframe per radio frame for performing the RSRP measurement; and four symbols containing CRS must be available in all subframes indicated by the time domain measurement resource restriction pattern.

The reporting range of RSRP is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with 1 dB resolution, and the mapping of the measured quantity is defined in Table 9.1.15.1.3-2. The range in the signaling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range. The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.3, clause 9.1.4, and A.9.1.15.

Additionally, the reference sensitivity power level (REFSENS) conditions are defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3. The REFSENS is the minimum mean power applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories except category 0, category M1, category M2, and category 1bis, or to the single antenna port for UE category 0, UE category M1, category M2, and UE category 1bis, at which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. The throughput for the REFSENS test is measured based on Transmission Mode 1 unless specified otherwise.","The answer must include the intra frequency absolute accuracy requirements for TDD RSRP measurements, the conditions under which these measurements are valid, the reporting range and mapping of measured quantity, and the normative references. Additionally, it should cover the reference sensitivity power level conditions, throughput requirements, and applicable UE categories as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101."
"Describe the procedures and conditions for semi-static channel occupancy in 3GPP TS 37.213, including the roles of gNB and UE, and the actions taken in case of channel access failure.","In 3GPP TS 37.213, the procedures and conditions for semi-static channel occupancy are outlined with specific roles for the gNB and UE, and actions taken in case of channel access failure. 

When semiStaticChannelAccessConfigUE is absent, the procedures in Clause 4.3.1.1 are followed. These procedures involve the gNB initiating channel occupancy and sharing it with UEs. The gNB must transmit a DL transmission burst starting at the beginning of a period after sensing the channel to be idle for at least a sensing slot duration. If the channel is busy, no transmission occurs during that period. The gNB can transmit DL bursts within the channel occupancy time after sensing the channel to be idle, provided the gap between bursts is more than a specified duration. Additionally, the gNB can transmit DL bursts after UL bursts without sensing the channel if the gap between them is at most a specified duration. UEs can transmit UL bursts after detecting DL bursts within the channel occupancy time, either without sensing the channel if the gap is at most a specified duration, or after sensing the channel to be idle if the gap is more than the specified duration. The gNB can also indicate to UEs to transmit UL bursts without sensing the channel or after sensing it to be idle. Both gNB and UEs must refrain from transmitting for a duration of at least a specified time before the start of the next period.

When semiStaticChannelAccessConfigUE is present, the procedures in Clause 4.3.1.2 are applicable. Although the specific details of Clause 4.3.1.2 are not provided, it generally involves different configurations and conditions for channel access.

In case a UE fails to access the channel(s) prior to an intended UL transmission to a gNB, Layer 1 notifies higher layers about the channel access failure.

For semi-static channel occupancy involving transmission on a set of channels, the gNB/UE must perform channel access on each channel according to the procedures described in Clauses 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. If the transmission is a UL transmission, the UE may not transmit if it fails to access any of the channels within the carrier bandwidth or if configured without intra-cell guard bands. For nominal repetitions of configured PUSCH transmissions with repetition type B, the transmission is dropped if the nominal repetition is not associated with the same channel occupancy for all channels and would overlap with an idle duration. For DL transmissions, the gNB may not transmit if it fails to access any of the channels within the DL bandwidth part or if configured without intra-cell guard bands.

Overall, the procedures ensure efficient and coordinated channel occupancy between gNB and UEs, with specific actions taken in case of channel access failures to maintain communication integrity.","The answer should include:
  - The distinction between procedures when semiStaticChannelAccessConfigUE is absent or present.
  - The role of Layer 1 in notifying higher layers about channel access failure.
  - Detailed steps for gNB-initiated channel occupancy, including sensing requirements and transmission burst conditions.
  - Conditions under which a UE can transmit UL bursts after DL bursts.

"Describe the security procedures an MCVideo client must follow upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing specific headers and MIME body, as outlined in 3GPP TS 24.281 and TS 33.180.","When an MCVideo client receives a SIP MESSAGE request containing a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcvideo' and an application/mikey MIME body, it must follow specific security procedures if the key identifier within the CSB-ID of the MIKEY payload is a CSK-ID (with the 4 most-significant bits having the value '2'). 

Firstly, the client must follow the security procedures outlined in clause 9.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.180 to extract the CSK. If the initiator field (IDRi) has type 'URI' (identity hiding is not used), the client must extract the initiator URI from the IDRi field of the I_MESSAGE as described in TS 33.180. If the initiator URI deviates from the public service identity of the participating MCVideo function serving the MCVideo user, the client must reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response, including warning text set to '136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed' in a Warning header field, and must not continue with the rest of the steps. If the initiator field (IDRi) has type 'UID' (identity hiding in use), the client must convert the public service identity of the participating MCVideo function serving the MCVideo user to a UID as described in TS 33.180, compare the generated UID with the UID in the IDRi field of the I_MESSAGE, and if the two UIDs deviate, reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 response, including the same warning text, and not continue with the rest of the steps.

The client must then use the UID to validate the signature of the I_MESSAGE as described in TS 33.180. If authentication verification of the I_MESSAGE fails, the client must reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 response, including the warning text '136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed' in a Warning header field, and not continue with the rest of the steps. Upon successful authentication, the client must extract and decrypt the encapsulated CSK using the participating MCVideo function's UID key as described in TS 33.180, and extract the CSK-ID from the payload.

Finally, upon successful extraction, the client must replace the existing CSK and CSK-ID associated with the participating MCVideo function with the extracted CSK and CSK-ID in the 'key download' message.","Key details the answer must include:
  - The conditions under which the MCVideo client must follow the security procedures.
  - Detailed steps for extracting and validating the CSK and CSK-ID, including handling of the initiator field based on its type.

"Explain the classification and error protection of bits in AMR-WB codec frames, including the handling of comfort noise bits and the significance of the CRC field.","In AMR-WB codec frames, bits are classified into three classes based on their importance and sensitivity to errors: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A bits are the most sensitive to errors, and any error in these bits typically results in a corrupted speech frame. These bits are protected by an 8-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) field, which is computed using the polynomial G(x)=D8 + D6 + D5 + D4 + 1 over all Class A bits of the AMR-WB Core Frame. The CRC value is included in the Codec CRC field of the AMR-WB Auxiliary Information.

Class B and Class C bits are less sensitive to errors compared to Class A bits. Errors in Class B bits gradually reduce speech quality, while errors in Class C bits have the least impact on speech quality. The number of bits in each class for different AMR-WB modes is specified in a table, ensuring that all speech bits are correctly assigned to their respective classes.

For comfort noise bits, which are associated with Frame Type Index 9, all bits are mapped to Class A, and Classes B and C are not used. This classification is a notation convention and does not have any practical significance for comfort noise bits. The comfort noise bits are produced by the AMR-WB speech encoder and include the SID Type Indicator (STI) and Mode Indication bits.

In the case of no transmission frame types (Frame Type Indices 14 and 15), the CRC field is not included in the AMR-WB frame. These frames contain only the AMR-WB Header information, which includes the corresponding Frame Type and the Frame Quality Indicator, while the AMR-WB Auxiliary Information and AMR-WB Core frame are omitted.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role and computation of the CRC field in AMR-WB codec frames, including the cyclic generator polynomial used.
  - The classification of bits into Class A, B, and C, their importance, and error sensitivity.
  - The specific handling and classification of comfort noise bits in Frame Type Index 9.
  - The omission of the CRC field in no transmission frame types (14 and 15) and the inclusion of header information."
"Describe the encoding schemes for different access bursts in the 3GPP TS 45.003 specification, including the specific procedures and bit configurations for each type of burst.","The 3GPP TS 45.003 specification outlines three coding schemes for access bursts used in random access uplink messages: bursts containing 8 information bits, 11 information bits, and 30 information bits.

1. **Access Burst Containing 8 Information Bits**:
   - The encoding process for the 8-bit access burst is detailed in subclause 4.6.1. It involves 8 information bits (d(0) to d(7)), six parity bits (p(0) to p(5)), and six colour bits (C(0) to C(5)) derived from the BSIC of the intended base station. The bits are then encoded using a convolutional code of rate ½, defined by the polynomials G0 = 1 + D3 + D4 and G1 = 1 + D + D3 + D4.

2. **Access Burst Containing 11 Information Bits**:
   - The encoding for the 11-bit access burst is specified in subclause 5.3.2. This burst is used for the packet random access channel (PRACH, CPRACH, and MPRACH). The detailed encoding process involves generating a block of 36 coded bits from the 11 information bits.

3. **Access Burst Containing 30 Information Bits**:
   - The encoding for the 30-bit access burst is defined in subclause 4.6.2. This burst is used in the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure when the Extended Access Burst method is employed. Initially, the mobile station sends a random access message with 11 information bits, encoded as per subclause 5.3.2. After receiving access grant from the network, it sends a subsequent message with 30 information bits, encoded as specified in subclause 4.6.2.1. The first 11 bits are encoded similarly to the 11-bit burst, and the remaining 19 bits are encoded as per the subsequent subclauses.

Additionally, subclauses 4.8 and 4.9 provide guidelines for encoding the 8-bit access burst on the random access channel (RACH), using the BSIC of the intended BTS or as indicated by network signalling.

In summary, the 3GPP TS 45.003 specification provides detailed encoding schemes for different types of access bursts, ensuring proper transmission and reception of random access messages in various network scenarios.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The three types of access bursts (8 bits, 11 bits, 30 bits) and their respective encoding subclauses.

"Describe the procedures for adding a video media flow to an ongoing speech session for both ICS and non-ICS UEs, considering different server enhancements and reference points.","The procedures for adding a video media flow to an ongoing speech session vary depending on whether the UE is ICS or non-ICS and the type of server enhancement and reference point used. 

For non-ICS UE via MSC Server enhanced for ICS:
1. The non-ICS UE A sends a MODIFY message requesting a service change from speech to multimedia (video and voice).
2. The MSC Server interacts with the MGW to modify bearer characteristics.
3. The MSC Server sends a re-INVITE message to the S-CSCF to add the video media to the ongoing speech session.
4. The S-CSCF forwards the re-INVITE to the SCC AS.
5. The SCC AS sends the re-INVITE back to the S-CSCF.
6. The S-CSCF forwards the re-INVITE to UE B.
7. Upon completion of the session and bearer setup procedures, the MSC Server performs video codec negotiation and sets up the multimedia bearer.

For non-ICS UE via MSC Server not enhanced for ICS:
1. The non-ICS UE A sends a MODIFY message requesting a service change from speech to multimedia (video and voice).
2. The MSC Server sends a Modify Codec message to the MGCF indicating the change.
3. The MGCF interacts with the IMS-MGW to modify bearer characteristics.
4. The MGCF sends a re-INVITE to the S-CSCF to add the video media to the ongoing speech session.
5-7. Steps 5-7 are identical to steps 4-6 in the procedure for MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
8. Upon completion of the session and bearer setup procedures, the MGCF/IMS-MGW sets up the multimedia bearer.

For ICS UE through SCUDIF using Gm reference point:
1. The ICS UE A sends a re-INVITE message to the S-CSCF to add the video media to the ongoing speech session.
2. The S-CSCF forwards the re-INVITE to the SCC AS.
3. The SCC AS sends a 200 OK message to the S-CSCF.
4. The S-CSCF forwards the 200 OK to the ICS UE A.
5. The service change is completed as specified in the relevant clauses depending on the type of MSC Server (enhanced or not enhanced for ICS).

For ICS UE through SCUDIF using I1 reference point:
1. The ICS UE A sends a Call MODIFY message to the SCC AS requesting a service change from speech to multimedia (video and voice).
2. The SCC AS sends a Call MODIFY Response message to the ICS UE A.
3. The service change is completed as specified in the relevant clauses depending on the type of MSC Server (enhanced or not enhanced for ICS).

These procedures involve specific message exchanges and interactions with network elements such as MGW, MGCF, IMS-MGW, and SCC AS, culminating in the setup of multimedia bearers and codec negotiation.","The answer should cover the detailed steps for each scenario: non-ICS UE with MSC Server enhanced for ICS, non-ICS UE with MSC Server not enhanced for ICS, ICS UE using Gm reference point, and ICS UE using I1 reference point. It should include the specific messages exchanged, interactions with network elements (MGW, MGCF, IMS-MGW, SCC AS), and the final steps for multimedia bearer setup and codec negotiation."
Explain the use and procedures associated with ACK and SACK supervisory frames in the context of Logical Link Entities (LLEs) as defined in 3GPP TS 44.064.,"In the context of Logical Link Entities (LLEs) as defined in 3GPP TS 44.064, ACK and SACK supervisory frames play crucial roles in the acknowledgment process of I frames. 

The ACK supervisory frame is used by an LLE to acknowledge the receipt of single or multiple I frames. Specifically, it acknowledges frames up to and including N(R) - 1, and frame N(R) + 1, indicating that these frames have been received correctly. Additionally, the ACK frame with the A bit set to 1 can be used by the LLE to request an acknowledgment from its peer LLE. The transmission of an ACK frame also signifies the clearance of any busy condition within the sending LLE that was previously reported by the transmission of an RNR frame by the same LLE. The procedures associated with the ACK control field are detailed in subclause 8.6.3.

Similarly, the SACK supervisory frame is used by an LLE to acknowledge the receipt of single or multiple I frames. It acknowledges frames up to and including N(R) - 1, and frames indicated by the SACK bitmap, confirming that these frames have been received correctly. Like the ACK frame, the SACK frame with the A bit set to 1 can be used by the LLE to request an acknowledgment from its peer LLE. The transmission of a SACK frame also indicates the clearance of any busy condition within the sending LLE that was previously reported by the transmission of an RNR frame by the same LLE. The procedures associated with the SACK control field are also defined in subclause 8.6.3.

In summary, both ACK and SACK supervisory frames are essential for acknowledging the receipt of I frames, requesting acknowledgments, and indicating the clearance of busy conditions within LLEs, with their associated procedures detailed in subclause 8.6.3 of 3GPP TS 44.064.","The answer must include the purpose of ACK and SACK supervisory frames, how they acknowledge I frames, the role of the A bit in requesting acknowledgments, and the indication of clearance of busy conditions. Additionally, it should reference the procedures associated with the ACK and SACK control fields as defined in subclause 8.6.3."
"Describe the network slice adaptation procedure for VAL applications as outlined in TS 23.434, and explain how DNS resolution is handled for applications using EAS according to TS 23.548.","The network slice adaptation procedure for VAL applications, as outlined in TS 23.434, involves several steps and key roles. Initially, the VAL client provides a new application requirement to the NSCE client, indicating a new service profile for the VAL application. This requirement may involve changes in application QoS, service operation, or other application-related parameters. The NSCE client then sends a network slice adaptation trigger to the NSCE server, which may specify the exact requested network slice or indicate the need for remapping to a different network slice.

The NSCE server processes this request and triggers the network slice configuration for each VAL UE within the VAL application. The server, acting as an Application Function (AF), provides the updated S-NSSAI and DNN per VAL UE to the Policy Control Function (PCF) via the Network Exposure Function (NEF). This guidance may update the route selection parameters to indicate different sets of PDU Session information that can be associated with applications matching the application traffic. It is important to note that the NSCE server provides the updated S-NSSAI/DNN as a suggestion, and it is up to the PCF to decide whether to perform the slice/DNN remapping. Finally, the NSCE server may send a notification to the NSCE client indicating the success or failure of the adaptation process.

Regarding DNS resolution for applications using EAS, as specified in TS 23.548, there are two methods to ensure that the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) requested by the application is resolved by the DNS server indicated by the Session Management Function (SMF). The first method involves sending a DNS query to the DNS server. The consumer in the UE provides the domain name to the EDC functionality, which then sends the DNS query to the DNS server. Once the DNS response is received, the EDC functionality forwards the IP address provided by the DNS resolver to the consumer.

The second method involves obtaining the IP address of the DNS server indicated by the SMF. The consumer in the UE requests the IP address from the EDC functionality, which then sends the IP address to the consumer and notifies them of any updates. The consumer then generates and sends a DNS query to the DNS server indicated by the EDC functionality. Both methods ensure that the DNS resolution process is handled efficiently for applications using EAS.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the network slice adaptation procedure for VAL applications, including the roles of VAL client, NSCE client, and NSCE server

Describe the procedures and functionalities related to the Policy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) in managing spending limit reporting and Sy sessions as specified in 3GPP TS 29.219.,"The Policy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) is a critical component in managing policy control decisions and flow-based charging control functionalities. One of its key roles involves handling spending limit reporting for subscribers. To initiate spending limit reporting, the PCRF must have at least one active IP-CAN session. The PCRF can request spending limit reporting from the Online Charging System (OCS) using the Initial or Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request procedures.

The Initial Spending Limit Report Request procedure is used when the PCRF needs the status of policy counters for which it does not have an existing subscription or when it no longer requires the status of some policy counters it previously subscribed to. In this procedure, the PCRF sets the SL-Request-Type AVP to INITIAL_REQUEST (0) for the first request and INTERMEDIATE_REQUEST (1) for subsequent requests.

The Final Spending Limit Report Request procedure is used to cancel all subscriptions for policy counters. This procedure is invoked when the PCRF needs to terminate the Sy session, which occurs when the last IP-CAN session for a subscriber is terminated or no IP-CAN session depends on the spending status information.

Upon receiving a request from the PCRF, the OCS checks for an ongoing Sy session associated with the received Session-Id AVP. If no Sy session exists and the SL-Request-Type AVP is set to INITIAL_REQUEST (0), the OCS creates a new Sy session. If the SL-Request-Type AVP is not set correctly, the OCS returns an error response. The OCS also handles known and unknown policy counter identifiers, returning appropriate status or error codes based on its configuration.

If the OCS decides to terminate a Sy session, it sends a Spending-Status-Notification-Request (SNR) to the PCRF, which then acknowledges the request and sends a Final Spending Limit Report Request to terminate the session. This termination may affect other interfaces like Rx or Gx, depending on the policy decision.

Overall, the PCRF's functionalities in managing spending limit reporting and Sy sessions are crucial for maintaining accurate and effective policy control and charging mechanisms.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role and functionalities of the PCRF in policy control and spending limit reporting.
  - The requirement of an active IP-CAN session for initiating Sy sessions.
  - The procedures for Initial and Intermediate Spending Limit Report Requests, including the SL-Request-Type AVP values.
  - The Final Spending Limit Report Request procedure for removing all subscriptions.
  - The OCS's handling of PCRF requests, including the creation of Sy sessions, response to known and unknown policy counter identifiers, and the result codes for different scenarios.

Describe the structure and components of the API URI for the Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization Service as defined in relevant documents.,"The API URI for the Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization Service is structured according to specific guidelines. The general format of the API URI is:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>

The components are defined as follows:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts including the scheme ('http' or 'https'), a fixed string '://', and the authority (host and optional port) as defined in IETF RFC 3986. The host should be represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). An optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character may also be included.

- <apiVersion>: The version of the API, which is 'v1' for this service.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 6.2.3 of the relevant document.

An example of an API URI from another 3GPP document is:
url: '{apiRoot}/nsmf-pdusession/v1'

What are the blocking requirements for Base Stations (BS) in different operating bands as specified in 3GPP TS 25.142 and TS 25.105?,"The blocking requirements for Base Stations (BS) in different operating bands are specified in 3GPP TS 25.142 and TS 25.105. The static reference performance must be met with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input using the parameters specified in various tables. For Wide Area BS, Local Area BS, and Home BS, the blocking requirements are detailed in tables 7.6A-1 to 7.9A-1 and 7.6A-2 to 7.9A-2 in TS 25.142, and tables 7.4A1(a) to 7.4A1(f) and 7.4A2(a) to 7.4A2(f) in TS 25.105.

The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF bandwidth or maximum radio bandwidth edges. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the in-band blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band, and the requirement also applies inside any inter RF bandwidth gap of at least 4.8MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper RF bandwidth edges inside the inter RF bandwidth gap and is equal to -2.4MHz/+2.4MHz, respectively. The out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each supported operating band, excluding the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands.

UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in various frequency bands, including:
a) 1900 - 1920 MHz and 2010 - 2025 MHz
b) 1850 - 1910 MHz and 1930 - 1990 MHz
c) 1910 - 1930 MHz
d) 2570 - 2620 MHz

"Explain the behavior of the receiving UM RLC entity in handling UMD PDUs, including the reordering window, t-Reordering timer, and state variables.","The receiving UM RLC entity handles UMD PDUs by maintaining a reordering window defined by the state variable VR(UH). A sequence number (SN) falls within the reordering window if (VR(UH) – UM_Window_Size) <= SN < VR(UH); otherwise, it falls outside the window. Upon receiving a UMD PDU from the lower layer, the entity either discards it or places it in the reception buffer. If placed in the buffer, the entity updates state variables, reassembles and delivers RLC SDUs to the upper layer, and starts or stops the t-Reordering timer as needed.

When t-Reordering expires, the entity updates VR(UR) to the SN of the first UMD PDU with SN >= VR(UX) that has not been received, reassembles RLC SDUs from any UMD PDUs with SN < updated VR(UR), removes RLC headers, and delivers the reassembled RLC SDUs to the upper layer in ascending order of the RLC SN if not delivered before. If VR(UH) > VR(UR), the entity starts t-Reordering and sets VR(UX) to VR(UH).

When a UMD PDU with SN = x is placed in the reception buffer, if rlc-OutOfOrderDelivery is configured and all byte segments of the UMD PDU are received, the entity reassembles the RLC SDU, removes RLC headers, and delivers the reassembled RLC SDU to the upper layer if not delivered before. If x falls outside the reordering window, VR(UH) is updated to x + 1, and the entity reassembles and delivers RLC SDUs from any UMD PDUs with SN that falls outside the reordering window. If VR(UR) falls outside the reordering window, VR(UR) is set to (VR(UH) – UM_Window_Size). If a UMD PDU with SN = VR(UR) has already been received, VR(UR) is updated to the SN of the first UMD PDU with SN > current VR(UR) that has not been received, and the entity reassembles and delivers RLC SDUs from any UMD PDUs with SN < updated VR(UR).

If t-Reordering is running and VR(UX) <= VR(UR) or VR(UX) falls outside the reordering window and is not equal to VR(UH), t-Reordering is stopped and reset. If t-Reordering is not running and VR(UH) > VR(UR), the entity starts t-Reordering and sets VR(UX) to VR(UH).

For NB-IoT, the receiving side of an RLC entity behaves such that the timer value of t-Reordering is 0 if not configured.

When a UMD PDU with SN = x is received from the lower layer, if VR(UR) < x < VR(UH) and the UMD PDU with SN = x has been received before, or if (VR(UH) – UM_Window_Size) <= x < VR(UR), the entity discards the received UMD PDU. Otherwise, it places the received UMD PDU in the reception buffer.","The answer should cover the definition and conditions of the reordering window, the actions taken upon receiving a UMD PDU, including discarding or placing it in the reception buffer, the behavior and conditions for starting and stopping the t-Reordering timer, and the specific actions when t-Reordering expires. It should also include the handling of state variables VR(UH), VR(UR), and VR(UX), and any specific behavior for NB-IoT."
What are the requirements for the UE to transmit PRACH preamble towards PSCell upon receiving PSCell addition and release commands according to 3GPP TS 36.521?,"Upon receiving a PSCell addition command in subframe n, the UE must be capable of transmitting the PRACH preamble towards the PSCell no later than in subframe n + Tconfig_PSCell. The calculation for Tconfig_PSCell is as follows: Tconfig_PSCell = 20ms + Tactivation_time + 50ms + TPCell_DU + TPSCell_DU. 

Tactivation_time represents the PSCell activation delay, which is 20ms if the PSCell is known and 30ms if the PSCell is unknown, provided the PSCell can be successfully detected on the first attempt. TPCell_DU is the delay uncertainty due to PCell PRACH preamble transmission, which can be up to 20ms if PSCell activation is interrupted by a PCell PRACH preamble transmission; otherwise, it is 0. TPSCell_DU is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the PSCell, which can be up to 30ms.

A PSCell is considered known if, during the last 5 seconds before the reception of the PSCell configuration command, the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the PSCell being configured, and the PSCell remains detectable according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 8.8. Additionally, the PSCell must remain detectable during the PSCell configuration delay according to the same conditions. If these criteria are not met, the PSCell is considered unknown.

The PCell interruption specified in clause 7.12 of 3GPP TS 36.133 is allowed only during the RRC reconfiguration procedure. The PSCell addition delay can be extended if SRS carrier-based switching occurs during the PSCell addition procedure.

Upon receiving a PSCell release command in subframe n, the UE must accomplish the release actions specified in clause 7.14 of 3GPP TS 36.133 no later than in subframe n + 20. Similar to the addition procedure, the PSCell release delay can be extended if SRS carrier-based switching occurs during the PSCell release procedure. The normative references for these requirements are found in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.14 and the respective annexes.","The answer must include the calculation of Tconfig_PSCell, the conditions under which Tactivation_time varies, the impact of TPCell_DU and TPSCell_DU, the criteria for PSCell being known or unknown, and the allowed PCell interruption during RRC reconfiguration. Additionally, it should mention the extension of PSCell addition and release delays due to SRS carrier-based switching and reference the normative requirements from 3GPP TS 36.133."
What are the manufacturer declaration requirements for a BS under test according to TS 25.142 5.7.4?,"According to TS 25.142 5.7.4, the manufacturer must declare two key aspects for a BS under test: 1) Whether the BS is intended to operate in geographic areas where UTRA FDD is deployed. If this is the case, compliance with the conformance requirement specified in subclause 6.6.3.2.4.1 is mandatory. 2) Whether the BS is intended to operate co-located with a UTRA FDD BS. If this is the case, compliance with the conformance requirement specified in subclause 6.6.3.2.4.2 is mandatory. If the declarations are negative, these requirements do not need to be tested.","The answer should include the two key declarations the manufacturer must make: 1) Whether the BS is intended to operate in areas where UTRA FDD is deployed, and 2) Whether the BS is intended to operate co-located with a UTRA FDD BS.

"What are the minimum conformance requirements for UE initial transmission timing error as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521, and how do they relate to the timing error limit value Te and the timing advance adjustments?","The minimum conformance requirements for UE initial transmission timing error are specified in clause 7.1.21.3 of 3GPP TS 36.521. According to this clause, the UE initial transmission timing error must be less than or equal to the timing error limit value Te, which is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.26.2 and shown in Table 7.1.21.3-1. This requirement applies to the first transmission in a DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, the first transmission in a repetition period (R>1) for PUCCH, PUSCH, and SRS, or the PRACH transmission.

The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control is the downlink timing of the reference cell. The downlink timing is defined as the time when the first detected path of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference cell. For PRACH, NTA_Ref is defined as 0, while for other channels, it is the difference between UE transmission timing and the downlink timing immediately after the last timing advance was applied. NTA_Ref for other channels remains unchanged until the next timing advance is received.

When it is not the first transmission in a DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, or there is no DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, and when it is the transmission for PUCCH, PUSCH, and SRS, the UE must be capable of adjusting the transmission timing according to the received downlink frame of the reference cell, except when the timing advance is applied. The UE transmission timing error must be less than or equal to Te as specified in Table 7.1.21.3-1.

For adjustments to UE uplink timing, the following rules apply:
1) The maximum magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment is Tq seconds.
2) The minimum aggregate adjustment rate is 7 * TS per second.
3) The maximum aggregate adjustment rate is Tq per 200 ms.

The maximum autonomous time adjustment step Tq is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24.2 and shown in Table 7.1.21.3-2. When a repetition period is configured on the uplink, the UE must not adjust the uplink transmission timing autonomously during an ongoing repetition period for which R>1.

The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.26 and A.7.1.21.","The answer should include the minimum conformance requirements for UE initial transmission timing error as specified in clause 7.1.21.3 of 3GPP TS 36.521.

The answer should also detail the timing error limit value Te as shown in Table 7.1.21.3-1, the rules for adjustments to UE uplink timing, and the maximum autonomous time adjustment step Tq as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24.2. Finally, the normative references to 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.26 and A.7.1.21 should be mentioned."

"Explain the roaming and access restriction information for a UE in the context of 5G networks, including how it is managed and propagated across different network nodes and scenarios.","In the context of 5G networks, roaming and access restriction information for a User Equipment (UE) includes various components that dictate the restrictions to be applied during subsequent mobility actions while the UE is in the CM-CONNECTED state. This information is provided and may be updated by the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). The components of this information include forbidden Radio Access Technologies (RATs), forbidden areas, service area restrictions, serving Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or Standalone Non-Public Network (SNPN), and potentially a list of equivalent PLMNs. Additionally, it may include Public Network Identifier (PNI)-NPN mobility restrictions, such as a list of Closed Access Groups (CAGs) allowed for the UE and whether the UE can access non-CAG cells.

Upon receiving this information, the gNB (next-generation NodeB) uses it to determine whether to apply restriction handling for subsequent mobility actions, such as handover or redirection. If the roaming and access restriction information is not available for a UE at the gNB, the gNB assumes there are no restrictions for subsequent mobility actions, except for PNI-NPN mobility restrictions.

When the roaming and access restriction information is received over NG or Xn signaling, it is propagated over Xn by the source gNB during Xn handover. If the handover results in a change of serving PLMN to an equivalent PLMN, the source gNB updates the serving PLMN to the target PLMN and moves the original serving PLMN to the equivalent PLMN list before propagating the information.

In scenarios where NG-RAN nodes with different versions of the XnAP or NGAP protocol are deployed, there is a risk of losing information provided by the 5GC within the NGAP Mobility Restriction List during Xn mobility. To mitigate this, the source NG-RAN node or an old NG-RAN node may provide a 5GC Mobility Restriction List Container to the target NG-RAN node or the new NG-RAN node, which contains the Mobility Restriction List as received from the 5GC. The target NG-RAN node or the new NG-RAN node uses the information from this container, except for the Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs, which are taken from the XnAP Mobility Restriction List.

For UEs operating in SNPN access mode, they only (re)select cells within the selected/registered SNPN, and a cell is considered suitable if the PLMN and Network Identifier (NID) broadcast by the cell match the selected/registered SNPN. Manual selection of SNPNs is supported, and Home Routing Network Names (HRNNs) can be optionally provided.

Regarding CAG cells, cell selection/reselection may be based on a UE autonomous search function, which determines when and where to search, but cannot contradict dedicated cell reselection priority information if stored. A range of Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) values reserved by the network for CAG cells may be broadcast. A CAG Member Cell for a UE is a cell broadcasting the identity of the selected PLMN, registered PLMN, or equivalent PLMN, and for that PLMN, a CAG identifier belonging to the Allowed CAG list of the UE. The UE checks the suitability of CAG cells based on the Allowed CAG list provided by upper layers. Manual selection of CAG cells is supported, and HRNNs can be optionally provided.

The roaming and access restrictions applicable to SNPN and PNI-NPN are described in detail in clause 9.4 of TS 38.300.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Definition and components of roaming and access restriction information for a UE.
  - How this information is provided and updated by the AMF.
  - The role of gNBs in using and propagating this information during mobility actions.

  - Specific rules for SNPN access mode, including cell reselection and manual selection.
  - Specific rules for CAG cells, including cell selection/reselection, PCI values, and manual selection.
  - References to relevant clauses in TS 38.300 for detailed descriptions."
"Explain the DTMF procedure in mobile stations, including the roles of START DTMF and STOP DTMF messages, and the associated timers.","The DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency) procedure in mobile stations involves the generation and transmission of DTMF tones, which are used for telecommunication signaling over analog telephone lines. The process is governed by specific messages and timers as outlined in the specifications.

When a user wants to generate a DTMF tone, they may press a key on the mobile station. This action is interpreted by the mobile station as a requirement to send a DTMF digit in a START DTMF message over an established FACCH (Fast Associated Control Channel). The START DTMF message contains the value of the digit to be transmitted, which can be any of the following: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, *, or #. Only a single digit is transferred in each START DTMF message. Upon sending this message, the mobile station starts timer T336.

The network, upon receiving the START DTMF message, can either convert the received digit into a DTMF tone and apply it toward the remote user or send the DTMF digit as an out-of-band message. The network then returns a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station, which can be used to generate an indication of successful transmission. If the network cannot accept the START DTMF message, it sends a START DTMF REJECT message instead. Upon receiving either the START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE or START DTMF REJECT message, the mobile station stops timer T336.

If timer T336 expires before receiving an acknowledgment or rejection, the mobile station terminates the ongoing DTMF procedure without any retransmissions and is free to begin another DTMF procedure.

When the user indicates that the DTMF sending should cease, for example by releasing the key, the mobile station sends a STOP DTMF message to the network and starts timer T337. The mobile station only sends a STOP DTMF message if a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message has been received from the network. If timer T337 expires, the mobile station terminates the ongoing DTMF procedure without any retransmissions and can start a new DTMF procedure.

Upon receiving the STOP DTMF message, the network either stops sending the DTMF tone if it was applied by the network or initiates a suitable out-of-band message. The network then returns a STOP DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station, which stops timer T337.

In summary, the DTMF procedure in mobile stations involves the use of START DTMF and STOP DTMF messages, with timers T336 and T337 ensuring proper timing and handling of these messages. The network's responses and the conditions for sending these messages are crucial for the successful transmission and termination of DTMF tones.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - How a user generates a DTMF tone and the role of the START DTMF message.
  - The digit values that can be transmitted in a START DTMF message.
  - The role of timer T336 in the START DTMF procedure.
  - Network actions upon receiving a START DTMF message, including conversion to DTMF tone or sending as an out-of-band message.

  - How the STOP DTMF message is triggered by the user and the role of timer T337.
  - Network actions upon receiving a STOP DTMF message.
  - The requirement for a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message before sending a STOP DTMF message.
  - The conditions under which the MS can terminate the ongoing DTMF procedure and start a new one."
Describe the interleaving process for the header and data bits in MCS-5 DL and MCS-5 UL as specified in the 3GPP TS 45.003 document.,"The interleaving process for the header and data bits in MCS-5 DL and MCS-5 UL is specified in the 3GPP TS 45.003 document as follows:

For MCS-5 DL:
1. Header Interleaving:
   The 100 coded bits of the header, {hc(0), hc(1), ..., hc(99)}, are interleaved according to the rule:
   hi(j) = hc(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 99
   j = 25(k mod 4) + ((17k) mod 25)

2. Data Interleaving:
   The data interleaving process does not have a closed expression but follows a block interleaver approach with a 1392 bit block size. The steps are:
   - The kth input data bit is mapped to the jth bit of the Bth burst, where k = 0, ..., 1391, B = mod(k,4), d = mod(k,464), and j = 3*(2mod(25d,58) + div(mod(d,8),4) + 2(-1)Bdiv(d,232)) + mod(k,3).
   - Data bit positions mapped onto header positions in the interleaved block are removed, leaving 1248 bits.
   - The bits are renumbered to fill out the gaps without changing the relative order.
   - The resulting interleaver transforms the block of 1248 coded bits, {dc(0), dc(1), ..., dc(1247)}, into a block of 1248 interleaved bits, {di(0), di(1), ..., di(1247)}.

For MCS-5 UL:
1. Header Interleaving:
   The 136 coded bits of the header, {hc(0), hc(1), ..., hc(135)}, are interleaved according to the rule:
   hi(j) = hc(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 135
   j = 34(k mod 4) + 2((11k) mod 17) + [(k mod 8)/4]

2. Data Interleaving:
   The data interleaving process for MCS-5 UL is the same as for MCS-5 DL, as specified in subclause 5.1.9.1.5.

In summary, the interleaving process for MCS-5 DL involves specific formulas for header bits and a detailed block interleaver approach for data bits, while MCS-5 UL uses a different formula for header bits but follows the same data interleaving process as MCS-5 DL.","The answer should include the specific interleaving formulas for the header bits in both MCS-5 DL and MCS-5 UL. It should also describe the block interleaver approach for the data bits in MCS-5 DL, including the mapping and renumbering process. Additionally, it should confirm that the data interleaving process for MCS-5 UL is the same as for MCS-5 DL."
How does the presence of the starting time information element affect the handling of frequency parameters in channel descriptions according to 3GPP TS 44.018?,"The starting time information element plays a crucial role in managing the frequency parameters of channels during a change of channel in mobile networks. When the starting time IE is included, it indicates the moment at which the network wants the mobile station to change the frequency parameters of the channels.

If the starting time IE is present and none of the information elements referring to before the starting time are included, the mobile station waits and accesses the channels at the indicated time. Conversely, if the starting time IE is present and at least one of the information elements referring to before the starting time is included, the mobile station does not wait for the indicated time and uses the frequency parameters for before the starting time.

When the starting time IE is not present, any information elements referring to before the starting time are considered unnecessary in the message. Additionally, if the description of the first channel before time IE is not present, the channel description for before the time is derived from the description of the first channel after time IE.

In cases where frequency hopping is indicated in the channel descriptions, specific information elements must be present. If at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements may be present and applies to all assigned channels before the starting time:
- Mobile Allocation, before time IE;
- Frequency list, before time IE;
- Frequency channel sequence, before time IE.

If none of these information elements are present, a frequency list for after the starting time must be included, which will also apply to the channels before the starting time.

Overall, the presence of the starting time IE dictates whether the mobile station waits for the indicated time or uses the frequency parameters immediately, and it ensures the correct handling of frequency hopping and necessary information elements before and after the starting time.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of the starting time information element's role in changing frequency parameters.
  - Conditions under which the mobile station waits or does not wait for the indicated time.
  - Requirements for frequency hopping and the necessary information elements before and after the starting time.
  - Handling of unnecessary information elements when certain conditions are not met.
  - Any specific differences or additional details provided in the documents."
Describe the process of Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision in a roaming scenario as per 3GPP TS 29.213.,"In a roaming scenario, the process of Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision involves several steps and interactions between the Home Policy and Charging Rules Function (H-PCRF), Visited Policy and Charging Rules Function (V-PCRF), and Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF). The steps are as follows:

1. The H-PCRF receives a trigger to update QoS Rules and event triggers for a gateway control session. This trigger can be internal or external, such as from the Application Function (AF). If the trigger is from the AF and requests access network information, the H-PCRF follows the procedure defined in clause 4a.5.16 to request this information. If the AF provides Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP, the H-PCRF may follow the procedures in clause 4a.5.10.6 to request resource sharing.

2. Instead of directly sending a Diameter Re-Auth-Request (RAR) to the BBERF, the H-PCRF sends the RAR to the V-PCRF to provision updated QoS Rules and event triggers. The V-PCRF then identifies the gateway control session if needed and performs local authorization of the updated QoS rules when necessary.

3. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the BBERF to provision the updated QoS rules and event triggers.

4. The BBERF installs, modifies, or removes the identified QoS Rules, enforces the authorized QoS, and enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the corresponding QoS Rules.

5. The BBERF sends a Diameter Re-Auth-Answer (RAA) to the V-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation. If network-initiated resource allocation procedures apply and the corresponding IP-CAN bearer cannot be established or modified to satisfy the bearer binding, the BBERF rejects the activation of a PCC rule.

6. The V-PCRF forwards the RAA to the H-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation.

7. If needed, the BBERF initiates access-specific procedures to create or modify existing IP-CAN bearers. When these procedures are completed and require notifications from the BBERF to the PCRF, additional steps described in clause 4.4.2 are executed.

This detailed process ensures that QoS rules are properly aligned and enforced across different network elements, even when the User Equipment (UE) is roaming.","The answer must include a detailed description of the steps involved in Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision when the UE is roaming. It should cover the roles and interactions between H-PCRF, V-PCRF, and BBERF, including the initiation of QoS rules update, the sending and acknowledgment of Diameter RAR and RAA messages, and the enforcement and modification of QoS rules. Additionally, it should mention any access-specific procedures that may be initiated by the BBERF and reference clause 4.4.2 for further details."
"Describe the process and significance of generating comfort noise in the FD-CNG encoder, including the role of spectral partitions and the combination of SID and shaping parameters.","The process of generating comfort noise in the FD-CNG (Frequency Domain Comfort Noise Generation) encoder involves several key steps and components. Firstly, noise estimates encoded in the SID (Silence Insertion Descriptor) frame are used to locally generate comfort noise (CNG) and update the encoder memories. The number of partitions used for generating CNG and their upper boundaries are determined based on bandwidths and bit-rates, with FD-CNG generating comfort noise above 50Hz.

The decoded SID parameters describe the energy of the background noise in spectral partitions. These parameters capture the spectral energy of the noise in FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) bins covering the core bandwidth, as well as in CLDFB (Complex Low Delay Filter Bank) bands above the core bandwidth.

Shaping parameters computed directly at the decoder differ from the SID parameters transmitted via SID frames. While both sets are computed from FFT partitions covering the core bandwidth, the decoder benefits from a higher number of spectral partitions, capturing the fine spectral structure of the background noise. However, the decoder-side noise estimates cannot adapt to changes in the actual background noise during inactive phases. In contrast, SID frames deliver new information about the spectral envelope at regular intervals during inactive phases. The FD-CNG combines these two sources of information to reproduce the fine spectral structure captured from the background noise during active phases, while updating the spectral envelope of the comfort noise during inactive parts with the help of SID information.

Interpolation is applied to the shaping parameters to obtain a full-resolution FFT power spectrum. This full-resolution spectrum is then converted to a lower resolution based on SID spectral partitions. By combining the low-resolution noise estimates obtained from the encoder (via SID frames) and the decoder, the full-resolution noise power spectrum can be scaled to yield a full-resolution noise power spectrum. This allows for accurate adjustment of the comfort noise level in each FFT bin during SID frames or zero frames, ensuring a consistent and realistic background noise experience.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The role of SID frames in generating comfort noise and updating encoder memories.
  - The significance of spectral partitions and their configurations based on bandwidths and bit-rates.
  - The difference between shaping parameters at the decoder and SID parameters transmitted via SID frames.
  - The process of combining SID and shaping parameters to reproduce fine spectral structure and adjust comfort noise levels.
  - The interpolation and conversion process to achieve full-resolution noise power spectrum."
What are the key specifications and requirements for UTRA/TDD as defined in 3GPP TS 25.105?,"The key specifications and requirements for UTRA/TDD as defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 include the following:

1. **Frequency Bands for UTRA/TDD Operation**:
   UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in several frequency bands:
   - 1900 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
   - 2010 - 2025 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

   - 1910 - 1930 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
   - 2570 - 2620 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
   - 2300 - 2400 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
   - 1880 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
   Note that deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not precluded, and in China, Band a only includes 2010 - 2025 MHz for the 1.28 Mcps TDD option. The co-existence of TDD and FDD in the same bands is still under study.

2. **Carrier Frequency Designation (UARFCN)**:
   The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA absolute radio frequency channel number (UARFCN). The value of the UARFCN in the IMT2000 band is defined as:
   - Nt = 5 * F (where F is the carrier frequency in MHz)
   Additional channels for operation in the frequency band 2570 - 2620 MHz for 3.84 Mcps are defined as:
   - Nt = 5 * (F - 2150.1 MHz) for 2572.5 MHz ≤ F ≤ 2617.5 MHz
   The 10 additional UARFCN for this band are: 2112, 2137, 2162, 2187, 2212, 2237, 2262, 2287, 2312, 2337.

3. **Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)**:
   EVM measures the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform, known as the error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine filter with bandwidth corresponding to the chip rate and roll-off α = 0.22. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage. The measurement interval is one timeslot, and the requirement is valid over the total power dynamic range.

4. **Code Domain Error (CDE) and Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)**:
   CDE is computed by projecting the error vector power onto the code domain at a specific spreading factor. The error power for each code is defined as the ratio to the mean power of the reference waveform, expressed in dB. The Peak Code Domain Error is the maximum value for CDE. The measurement interval is one timeslot.

5. **Minimum Requirements for Modulation Quality**:

"Describe the instantiation procedures for ECS and EES as defined in 3GPP TS 28.538, including the key steps and requirements involved.","The instantiation procedures for ECS (Edge Computing System) and EES (Edge Enabler Server) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.538 involve several key steps and specific requirements.

For ECS instantiation:
1. The PLMN operator or ECSP requests the ECS instantiation via the provisioning MnS. This request uses the createMOI operation defined in 3GPP TS 28.532 and includes ECS-related requirements such as ecsAddress (URLs and/or IP addresses of ECS) and providerIdentifier (identifying the ECSP providing the ECS).
2. The Provisioning MnS Producer returns a response indicating that the instantiation operation is in progress.
3. The NF instance creation procedure described in clause 7.10 of 3GPP TS 28.532 is reused to instantiate the ECS VNF instance with the requirements captured in the ECSFunction IOC.
4. If the ECS VNF instantiation fails, a notification is sent to indicate the failure.
5. If the ECS VNF instantiation succeeds, the producer creates the MOI (Managed Object Instance) for ECSFunction IOC, which contains attributes defined in ECSFunction IOC. A notification is sent to indicate the successful creation of the ECSFunction instance.

For EES instantiation:
1. The PLMN operator or ECSP requests the EES instantiation via the provisioning MnS. This request uses the createMOI operation defined in 3GPP TS 28.532 and includes EES-related requirements such as EDN identifier (identifying the EDN to contain the EES) and EAS identifier (identifying the list of EAS registered with the EES, which is optional depending on the availability of the EAS).
2. The Provisioning MnS Producer returns a response indicating that the instantiation operation is in progress.
3. The NF instance creation procedure described in clause 7.10 of 3GPP TS 28.532 is reused to instantiate the EES VNF instance with the requirements provided in the instantiation request.
4. If the EES VNF instantiation fails, a notification is sent to indicate the failure.
5. If the EES VNF instantiation succeeds, the producer creates the MOI (Managed Object Instance) for EESFunction IOC, which contains attributes defined in EESFunction IOC. A notification is sent to indicate the successful creation of the EESFunction instance.

Both procedures ensure that the instantiation process is systematically handled, with clear steps for managing success and failure, and the creation of the necessary Managed Object Instances.","The answer must include a detailed description of the instantiation procedures for both ECS and EES. It should cover the steps involved in the instantiation process, the specific requirements that need to be provided in the request, how the instantiation success and failure are handled, and the creation of the Managed Object Instance (MOI) for ECSFunction IOC and EESFunction IOC respectively."
Describe the power-saving mechanism and wake-up procedure in the 3GPP TS 27.010 standard.,"The 3GPP TS 27.010 standard outlines a detailed power-saving mechanism and wake-up procedure to minimize power consumption in User Equipment (UE) and Terminal Equipment (TE). 

The time between frames should be filled with continuous stop-polarity, except during the wake-up procedure. Alternatively, the receiver can operate correctly if the time between frames is filled with flag characters. If a receiver receives more than three consecutive flags, it should begin to transmit continuous flags at the first available time.

To minimize power consumption, the multiplexer system must be able to close down cleanly if either the TE or UE wishes to enter a low-power state. This is achieved using the multiplexer control channel. When either station wishes to enter a low-power state, it sends a power saving control command message to the other station. The receiving station completes any ongoing frame transmissions, reports a busy or power-down condition to higher layers, freezes all timers, and sends a power saving control response message. Upon receiving the acknowledgment, the initiating station can enter the reduced-power state.

Either station can request the other to enter a low-power state by sending a power saving control command, which must be acknowledged with a power saving control response message. The responding station may choose not to enter the low-power state. If no response is received, the commanding station may repeat the command but must first use the wake-up procedure.

The wake-up procedure involves the transmission of continuous flag characters. When the other station receives these flag characters, it wakes up (if necessary) and starts sending flag characters. The initiating station then stops sending flags and starts transmitting the first frame. Upon detecting a valid frame, the second station stops sending flags, unfreezes its timers, and resumes normal operation. If no response is received within a specified time (T3), an alarm is raised to higher layers, and the transmission of flags stops.

The power saving control messages use a specific type field octet, with the length byte containing the value 0 and no value octets. This ensures efficient communication and control during the power-saving process.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The method for filling time between frames and the receiver's response to consecutive flags.
  - The significance of power-saving in UE and TE, and the process for entering a low-power state using the multiplexer control channel.
  - The procedure for sending and acknowledging power saving control messages.
  - The wake-up procedure involving continuous flag characters and the steps taken by both stations during this process."
"Describe the key considerations and requirements for MTSI MGWs in optimizing speech communication over the NNI, including codec preferences, packetization, and dynamic media handling.","To optimize speech communication over the Network-to-Network Interface (NNI), MTSI Media Gateways (MGWs) must adhere to several key considerations and requirements:

1. **Codec Preferences**:
   - The preferred codec order is crucial for balancing quality and bandwidth. The best option is to use a codec end-to-end, such as AMR or AMR-WB, which avoids transcoding through G.711 or G.722.
   - If end-to-end codec usage is not possible, the next best solution is to use G.711 for narrow-band speech and G.722 for wide-band speech as inter-connection codecs, as they offer good quality at reasonable bit rates.
   - The linear 16-bit PCM format should only be used as a last resort when other solutions are not feasible.
   - Avoid falling back to narrow-band speech if wide-band speech is possible, unless bit rate constraints or other conditions necessitate it to prevent session setup failure.

2. **Packetization**:
   - For G.711, G.722, and linear 16-bit PCM formats, the frame length must be 20 ms, with 160 samples for narrow-band and 320 samples for wide-band speech per frame.
   - MTSI MGWs should support encapsulating up to 4 non-redundant speech frames into RTP packets and may support up to 8 redundant frames, allowing a maximum of 12 frames per RTP packet.
   - Packetization schemes indicated by the ptime value in the SDP offer and answer should be used. If no ptime value is present, encapsulate 1 frame per packet or follow the packetization used by end-point clients.
   - Align packetization between networks to ensure consistent end-to-end packetization, even when transcoding is involved. Adjust packetization to match the end-point clients to minimize jitter-induced buffering times.
   - If packet size exceeds the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of the network, encapsulate fewer frames per packet to avoid fragmentation.

3. **Dynamic Media Handling**:
   - MTSI MGWs must be capable of dynamically adding and dropping speech media during sessions.
   - When creating an SDP offer to send to the remote network, the MGW may use the original SDP offer from the MTSI client in the terminal. If codecs are added, follow the recommendations for codec preference order.
   - Maintain the ptime and maxptime values indicated by the MTSI client in the terminal. If generating an SDP offer without the client's offer, define ptime and maxptime values as 20 and 80 respectively.
   - If AVPF or SDPCapNeg is not supported, do not include corresponding lines in the SDP offer sent to the remote network.

By adhering to these guidelines, MTSI MGWs can ensure efficient and high-quality speech communication over the NNI.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The preferred codec order for MTSI MGWs to optimize quality-bandwidth compromise, including the use of AMR/AMR-WB, G.711/G.722, and linear 16-bit PCM.
  - Frame length requirements for G.711, G.722, and PCM formats, and the encapsulation of speech frames into RTP packets.

  - The capability of MTSI MGWs to dynamically add and drop speech media during sessions, and the handling of SDP offers and answers, including maintaining ptime and maxptime values."
Describe the process and information flow involved in fetching the group list for a VAL UE/VAL User.,"The process of fetching the group list for a VAL UE/VAL User involves several steps and specific information flows between the VAL client, group management client, and group management server. 

Pre-conditions for the group list fetch operation include:
1) The list of groups to which a VAL UE/VAL User belongs is known to the group management server for each VAL UE/VAL User.
2) The VAL user has not received the group announcement message as it was offline previously.

The steps involved in the group list fetch process are as follows:
1) The VAL client requests the group management client to provide the list of groups in which the VAL UE or VAL User is a member.
2) The group management client initiates the group list fetch request towards the group management server. The information elements described in the relevant documentation are included in the group list fetch request.
3) The group management server checks the authorization of the group list fetch request and, if authorized, sends the group list fetch response containing the list of groups in which the VAL user is a member. The information elements described in the relevant documentation are included in the group list fetch response.
4) The group management client notifies the list of groups to the VAL client.

The information elements included in the group list fetch request from the group management client to the group management server are detailed in Table 10.3.2.36-1. Similarly, the information elements included in the group list fetch response from the group management server to the group management client are detailed in Table 10.3.2.37-1.

Overall, the roles of the VAL client, group management client, and group management server are crucial in ensuring the successful fetching of the group list for a VAL UE/VAL User.","The answer must include the pre-conditions for the group list fetch operation, the steps involved in the process, and the specific information elements included in both the group list fetch request and response. It should clearly outline the roles of the VAL client, group management client, and group management server in the process."
How are independent units signaled and handled in MBMS as per 3GPP TS 26.346 specifications?,"Independent units in MBMS are signaled in the File entry of an FDT Instance using the attribute mbms2015: IndependentUnitPositions. This signaling is defined in clause 7.9.3.2 of the specification. Independent units represent a non-empty list of byte locations, each indicating the position of the first byte of an independent unit. An independent unit is the chunk of bytes between two consecutive entries in the IndependentUnitPositions list, except for the last independent unit, which ranges from the last entry in the list to the end of the file. The position of an independent unit is the byte position in the file where the handler assigned to the Content-Type for the file may access the file.

MBMS clients that support partial file handling may also support the handling of independent units, as detailed in clause 7.9.2. These clients can manage independent units by accessing the specified byte positions and processing the chunks of data accordingly.

However, there are restrictions on the use of independent units in the FDT Instance. The attribute mbms2015: IndependentUnitPositions shall not be used in combination with the Content-Encoding attribute. Additionally, the generation of the IndependentUnitPositions values is outside the scope of the specification.","The answer should cover the signaling of independent units using the mbms2015: IndependentUnitPositions attribute, the handling of independent units by MBMS clients, the definition and byte locations of independent units, and any restrictions on their use in the FDT Instance."
Describe the procedures for handling SIP INVITE and SIP REFER requests for private calls or first-to-answer calls without floor control in MCPTT as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 and TS 24.380.,"The procedures for handling SIP INVITE and SIP REFER requests for private calls or first-to-answer calls without floor control in MCPTT are detailed in 3GPP TS 24.379 and TS 24.380. 

Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request for originating participating MCPTT function for a private call or first-to-answer call with an SDP offer that does not include a media-level section for media plane control messages, the participating MCPTT function will treat it as a request for a private call or first-to-answer call without floor control. The function will then follow the procedures specified in clause 11.1.1.3.1.1 for an on-demand session.

What are the requirements and considerations for LTE operation in very large cell sizes?,"The requirements and considerations for LTE operation in very large cell sizes are detailed in several aspects. Firstly, LTE operation should be possible with cell sizes up to 100 km, although high performance is not expected in such extreme cases. System performance at larger cell sizes, including spectral efficiency and user throughput, has been evaluated for cell sizes up to an inter-site distance of 7500 m and a cell radius of 5000 m. These evaluations indicate that the relative gains in LTE system performance for larger cell ranges are similar to or slightly lower than those for smaller cell ranges.

One critical function that may limit the cell size is the random-access procedure. To support very large cell sizes, an adjustable random-access-burst length is implemented. Additionally, in TDD mode, timing advance at the transmitter side is crucial to ensure time-aligned reception/transmission at the receiver side. This is facilitated by allowing a variable number of idle symbols at the downlink/uplink switching point. In very large cells, a larger number of idle symbols may be needed, which can lead to efficiency loss if frequent downlink/uplink switching points are used. However, in scenarios with very large cells, low round-trip time is less critical, allowing for less frequent switching points and thus reducing overhead due to idle symbols. Therefore, LTE TDD can support very large cell sizes with these considerations.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The maximum cell size for LTE operation as specified in TS 25.912.
  - The impact of larger cell sizes on system performance, including spectral efficiency and user throughput.
  - Specific considerations for random-access procedures in large cells.
  - Timing advance requirements in TDD mode for large cells.
  - Any potential efficiency losses and how they can be mitigated in very large cell scenarios."
"Describe the procedures and authorization requirements for AF interactions with the NEF in the context of MBS TMGI allocation, deallocation, and expiry notifications.","The authorization process for AF interactions with the 5GC via the NEF is defined in TS 23.247. The AF must be authorized by the 5GC to deliver MBS data or interact with the 5GC. The NEF performs authorization to determine whether the interaction with the 5GC is allowed.

For requesting the allocation or refresh of MBS TMGI(s), the AF sends a Nnef_MBSTMGI_Allocation request message to the NEF using the HTTP POST method. The request body includes the TmgiAllocRequest data structure with attributes such as 'afId' (identifier of the AF), 'tmgiParams' (parameters for TMGI allocation or refresh), 'suppFeat' (features supported by the AF), and optional attributes like 'notificationUri', 'requestTestNotification', 'websockNotifConfig', and 'mbsServiceArea' or 'extMbsServiceArea'. The NEF checks the authorization of the AF as per TS 23.247. If authorized, the NEF translates the MBS service area information, determines the target MB-SMF, and conveys the request to the MB-SMF using the Nmbsmf_TMGI service API. Upon successful response from the MB-SMF, the NEF forwards the information to the AF with an HTTP '200 OK' status code. In case of failure, the NEF handles errors as specified in TS 29.522 5.19.7 and responds with an appropriate error status code.

For requesting the deallocation of previously allocated MBS TMGI(s), the AF sends a Nnef_MBSTMGI_Deallocation request message to the NEF using the HTTP POST method. The request body includes the TmgiDeallocRequest data structure with attributes 'afId' (identifier of the AF) and 'tmgis' (list of MBS TMGI(s) for deallocation). The NEF checks the authorization of the AF as per TS 23.247. If authorized, the NEF conveys the deallocation request to the MB-SMF using the Nmbsmf_TMGI service API. Upon successful response from the MB-SMF, the NEF forwards the confirmation to the AF with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code. In case of failure, the NEF handles errors as specified in TS 29.522 5.19.7 and responds with an appropriate error status code.

For notifying an AF of timer expiry for previously allocated MBS TMGI(s), the NEF sends a Nnef_MBSTMGI_ExpiryNotify request message to the AF using the HTTP POST method. The request body includes the ExpiryNotif data structure with the 'tmgis' attribute (list of MBS TMGI(s) for which the timer has expired). The AF acknowledges the successful reception by sending a Nnef_MBSTMGI_ExpiryNotify response message with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code.

"Describe the test procedure for verifying RRC connection release with redirection from NR to NR, including the initial conditions, test steps, and performance requirements.","The test procedure for verifying RRC connection release with redirection from NR to NR involves several key steps and conditions. 

Firstly, the purpose of the test is to verify the RRC connection release with redirection from NR to NR. This test is applicable to all types of NR UE from Release 15 onwards. The minimum conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.133.

The initial conditions for the test include configuring the test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) according to the parameters defined in the relevant tables. Specifically, the general test parameters for PCell and neighbor cell are provided, and the message contents are defined in TS 38.508-1. The test involves two carriers and two NR cells, Cell 1 and Cell 2, which are configured according to specific annexes.

The test procedure consists of two successive time periods, T1 and T2. During T1, the “RRCRelease” message is sent to the UE, and T2 starts when the last Transmission Time Interval (TTI) containing the RRC message is sent to the UE. Prior to T2, the UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2, which is powered up at the beginning of T2. Cell 1 and Cell 2 belong to different tracking areas.

The detailed steps of the test procedure are as follows:
1. Ensure the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific parameters set according to TS 38.508-1, with Cell 1 as the active cell.
2. Set the parameters according to the defined table and start T1.
3. Transmit an RRCRelease message during T1.
4. Switch the power setting from T1 to T2 as specified, and start T2 when the last TTI containing the RRCRelease message is sent to the UE.
5. If the UE transmits the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) to Cell 2 within 2240 ms from the beginning of T2, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it is considered a failure.
6. After T2 expires, switch off the UE and ensure it is in the RRC_CONNECTED state again with Cell 1 as the active cell and Cell 2 powered off.
7. Set Cell 2's physical cell identity for the next iteration of the test procedure loop.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until the confidence level is achieved.

The message contents for the test are according to TS 38.508-1 with specific exceptions. The primary level settings for the test case are defined, and the UE must start transmitting the PRACH to Cell 2 within 2240 ms from the beginning of T2. The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed during repeated tests must be at least 90%.

The redirection delay can be expressed as the sum of several components: TRRC_procedure_delay, Tidentify-NR, TSI-NR, and TRACH, which together total 2240 ms. The UE performance requirements for procedures are specified in TS 38.331, which defines the RRC procedure delay and other relevant performance metrics.","The answer should include the following key details:

Compare the test requirements for PSCell addition and release delays under fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells for E-UTRAN FDD and TDD as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The test requirements for PSCell addition and release delays under fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells for E-UTRAN FDD and TDD as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 are largely similar, with some differences in the specific configurations.

For both E-UTRAN FDD and TDD:
- The UE shall transmit the PRACH to PSCell at latest 115 ms into T3.
- The UE shall send at least one CSI report for PSCell with non-zero CQI index during T4.
- The UE shall periodically send CSI reports for PSCell after the UE has sent the first CQI report with non-zero CQI index during T4.
- The UE shall stop sending CSI reports for PSCell at latest 16 ms into T5.
- All of the above test requirements must be fulfilled for the observed PSCell addition delay and PSCell release delay to be counted as correct.
- The rate of correct observed PSCell addition delay and PSCell release delay during repeated tests must be at least 90%.
- The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The calculation of PSCell addition delay is also identical for both FDD and TDD, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.14.2:
Tconfig_PSCell = 15 ms + Tactivation_time + 50 ms + TPCell_DU + TPSCell_DU
Where:
- Tactivation_time = 20 ms (cell2 is known to the UE)
- TPCell_DU = 0 (due to PRACH configurations in cell1 and cell2 being orthogonal in time, i.e., non-overlapping in time)
- TPSCell_DU = 30 ms (delay due to PRACH transmission to cell2)
This gives a total of 115 ms.

The primary difference between the documents lies in the specific test parameters for E-UTRAN FDD (Documents 1 and 2) and E-UTRAN TDD (Document 3), but the overall requirements and calculations remain consistent across both technologies.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The similarities and differences in the test requirements for PSCell addition and release delays between E-UTRAN FDD and TDD.
- The specific timings for PRACH transmission to PSCell, CSI reporting requirements, and the stopping of CSI reports.
- The calculation of PSCell addition delay as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.14.2.
- The requirement for the rate of correct observed PSCell addition delay and PSCell release delay during repeated tests to be at least 90%.
- The condition that the UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled."
"Describe the priority levels and conditions for processing location requests in 3GPP networks, including the handling of barred users and lawful access requirements.","In 3GPP networks, location requests are processed with varying levels of priority depending on the type of service. For Value Added Services and PLMN Operator Services, location requests can be assigned different priority levels, with higher priority requests receiving faster access to resources and potentially more accurate location estimates. Emergency Services location requests, as required by local regulatory requirements, are processed with the highest priority level.

Operators have the ability to bar the Location Service for specific users at any time, which means any location requests towards the user's Target UE and their own location requests towards their own Target UE are barred. If a location request fails due to barring, an error cause is returned to the LCS Requestor. However, for Emergency Services, other services required by local regulatory requirements, and PLMN Operator Services, location requests are processed with the highest priority level regardless of the barring status.

Regarding lawful access requirements, depending on national regulations, the CSP may be required to report the location of the target at the beginning and end of CS calls and PS and IMS sessions, during ongoing communications, and for any mobility management event detected in the 3GPP core network. The location information reported must be trusted by the 3GPP network and may include the access point's identity in the access network or the entry point into the 3GPP core network for non-3GPP access networks. Additional requirements may include reporting third-party provided location information and geographic or civic address information.

Lawful Access Location Services (LALS) must ensure that any UE served by the PLMN can be targeted, report reasons for location positioning failures, and suppress notifications to the target UE user. LALS must support location requests for both active and idle UEs, provide the most recent location information if available, and accommodate evolving LCS mechanisms and service requirements. Only authorized network functions and resources can provide LALS information, and LALS must support location requests in both circuit-switched and packet-switched domains. National regulations may impose additional requirements, such as higher accuracy and security for LALS compared to commercial LCS services, and support for multiple requests from different LEAs. The load from LALS requests may impact network and UE performance, potentially requiring operator-imposed limits.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Different priority levels for location requests based on the type of service (Value Added Services, PLMN Operator Services, Emergency Services).
- The ability of operators to bar location services for specific users and the exceptions to this rule.
- Reporting requirements for the location of the target during communications and mobility events, including the types of location information that must be reported.
- Lawful access requirements for location services, including targetability, failure reporting, notification suppression, support for different domains and identifiers, and the impact on network and UE performance."
"Explain the procedures and conditions under which a Super-Charged HLR sends or does not send a cancel location message during location updating in a Super-Charged network, referencing the relevant 3GPP specifications.","In a Super-Charged network, the Home Location Register (HLR) plays a crucial role in determining whether to send a cancel location message during location updating. The decision is primarily based on whether the previous network entity supports the Super-Charger functionality.

1. **Role of the HLR**: When a subscriber performs location updating, the HLR must determine if the previous network entity supports the Super-Charger functionality. If it does not, the HLR will cancel the subscription information at the previous network entity. If it does support Super-Charger, the HLR will retain the subscription data unless specific conditions necessitate cancellation.

2. **Conditions for Sending Cancel Location Message**: According to clause 5.2.3.0, the cancel location procedures are generally not used within and between Super-Charged networks. However, they are required for interworking with GSM and UMTS networks that do not support Super-Charger functionality. Additionally, the cancel location message is sent to notify the previous network entity to release connections when the subscriber moves to another network entity.

3. **Subscription Data Consistency**: The HLR must check if the subscription data retained by the serving network entity is consistent with the data stored in the HLR. If the data is consistent, the HLR will not send subscription data to the serving network entity. If it is inconsistent, the HLR will update the subscription data as per the procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.012.

4. **Location Updating Procedures**:
   - **No Record of Subscriber**: If there is no record of the subscriber, the network entity initiates location updating procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.012. The HLR will respond based on whether the previous network entity supports Super-Charger functionality.
   - **Retained Subscription Data**: If subscription data has been retained, the HLR will determine the consistency of the data. If consistent, no new subscription data is sent; if inconsistent, the HLR updates the data accordingly.

5. **Mechanisms for Notification**: It is recommended that the HLR store an indication of whether the serving network entity supports Super-Charger functionality. Mechanisms should be in place to decide when to notify the previous network entity. Without these mechanisms, the cancel location message is always sent.

6. **Mobile Terminating Roaming Features**: For HLRs supporting mobile terminating roaming forwarding and retry features, a MAP Cancel Location message is always sent to the old Visitor Location Register (VLR) upon receipt of the MAP Update Location from the new VLR, regardless of Super-Charger support.

In summary, the procedures and conditions under which a Super-Charged HLR sends or does not send a cancel location message during location updating are determined by the support of Super-Charger functionality by the previous network entity, the consistency of subscription data, and specific interworking requirements with non-Super-Charged networks.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of the HLR in determining whether to send a cancel location message based on the support of Super-Charger functionality by the previous network entity.
  - The conditions described in clause 5.2.3.0 that necessitate sending a cancel location message.
  - The handling of subscription data consistency between the HLR and the serving network entity.
  - The specific procedures for location updating when there is no record of the subscriber or when subscription data has been retained.
  - The mechanisms recommended for HLRs to decide when to notify the previous network entity and the implications of mobile terminating roaming forwarding and retry features."
"Describe the CRC generation process for Frame Control Part and Frame Payload Part in TS 25.446, including the generator polynomials and error detection capabilities.","The CRC generation process for both the Frame Control Part and Frame Payload Part in TS 25.446 involves using specific generator polynomials and systematic encoding to ensure error detection capabilities.

For the Frame Control Part, the CRC is a 6-bit checksum based on the generator polynomial G(D) = D6 + D5 + D3 + D2 + D1 + 1. This polynomial ensures that all error bursts shorter than 7 bits are detected, as well as all odd number of bits faulty (and two-bit faults) when the protected area is shorter than 24 bits (maximum 3 octets).

For the Frame Payload Part, the CRC is a 10-bit checksum based on the generator polynomial G(D) = D10 + D9 + D5 + D4 + D1 + 1. This polynomial ensures that all error bursts shorter than 11 bits are detected, as well as all odd number of bits faulty (and two-bit faults) when the protected area is shorter than 500 bits (maximum 62 octets).

The encoding process is performed in a systematic form, meaning that in GF(2), the polynomial yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by the respective generator polynomial (gCRC6(D) for the 6-bit CRC and gCRC10(D) for the 10-bit CRC). This systematic encoding ensures that the parity bits are generated correctly and the error detection capabilities are maintained.","The answer should include the CRC generation process for both Frame Control Part and Frame Payload Part, specifying the generator polynomials used (G(D) = D6+D5+D3+D2+D1+1 for Frame Control Part and G(D) = D10+D9+D5+D4+D1+1 for Frame Payload Part). It should explain the systematic encoding process and the error detection capabilities, highlighting the detection of error bursts and odd number of bits faulty for the respective protected areas."
"Explain the interaction and connection maintenance between V-PCRF and H-PCRF as per 3GPP specifications, including the handling of specific AVPs and the role of session binding.","The interaction between the V-PCRF (Visited Policy and Charging Rules Function) and the H-PCRF (Home Policy and Charging Rules Function) is governed by several 3GPP specifications. The V-PCRF may act as a Diameter Proxy or client/server to send Rx messages between the V-AF (Visited Application Function) and the H-PCRF. If the Subscription-Id AVP is received in the AAR (Authorization and Authentication Request) command and the IMSI cannot be extracted, or if the Subscription-ID AVP is not received, the V-PCRF may determine the Destination-Realm based on session binding within the V-PCRF. Session binding allows the V-PCRF to find the UE Identity received from Gx/Gxx reference points and use it to construct the EPC Home Network Realm/Domain, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.003, clause 19.2.

If the IP-Domain-Id is received in the AAR command from the V-AF, the V-PCRF may remove it before forwarding the AAR command to the H-PCRF if session binding is performed. Additionally, the V-PCRF may add Subscription-Id AVP and Called-Station-Id AVP received over Gx/Gxx reference points to the AAR command before sending it to the H-PCRF to assist in session binding.

The V-PCRF processes the initial or modified Service Information received from the V-AF according to operator policy to decide whether the request is accepted. If the service information is rejected, the V-PCRF sends an AAA (Authorization and Authentication Answer) to reject the request with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED and does not forward the AAR to the H-PCRF. The V-PCRF also does not forward the AAR message if the processing results in specific values of the ","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of V-PCRF and H-PCRF in the interaction and message forwarding.
  - How Subscription-Id AVP and IP-Domain-Id are handled in AAR commands.

Describe the procedures and performance criteria for testing immunity and emissions in E-UTRA devices according to 3GPP TS 36.124.,"The procedures and performance criteria for testing immunity and emissions in E-UTRA devices according to 3GPP TS 36.124 are detailed as follows:

1. **Communication Link Setup and Conditions**:
   - The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency is selected by setting the E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) to an appropriate number.
   - A communication link must be established with a suitable base station simulator located outside the test environment.
   - For traffic mode, a call is set up according to the Generic call set-up procedure, with conditions such as continuously sending positive TPC commands to the UE, disabling DTX, enabling uplink power control, and setting the transmitting/receiving bit rate for the reference test channel as specified in Annex C of TS 36.101.
   - For idle mode, the UE must be camped on a cell, perform Location Registration before the test, have an empty neighbour cell list, and set the paging repetition period and DRX cycle to the minimum.

2. **Immunity Testing**:
   - During immunity tests, responses at discrete frequencies (narrow band responses) are identified by adjusting the unwanted signal frequency by BWChannel MHz or 2 x BWChannel MHz. If the deviation persists, it is considered a wide band EMC phenomenon, and the equipment fails the test.
   - The test method follows IEC 61000-4-3, with a test level of 3 V/m amplitude modulated to a depth of 80% by a sinusoidal audio signal of 1 kHz, and stepped frequency increments of 1% of the momentary frequency over the range 80 MHz to 6000 MHz.

3. **Emission Testing**:
   - For emission testing, the wanted input signal level should be no more than 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level to avoid limiting the performance of the measuring receiver by strong signal effects.

4. **Performance Criteria**:
   - In data transfer mode, the throughput must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex C of TS 36.101.
   - In speech mode, the uplink and downlink speech output levels must be at least 35 dB less than the recorded reference levels when measured through an audio band pass filter of width 200 Hz centered on 1 kHz.
   - At the conclusion of the test, the EUT must operate as intended with no loss of user control functions or stored data, and the communication link must be maintained.

5. **Conducted Immunity Testing**:
   - The test method follows IEC 61000-4-6, with the test signal amplitude modulated to a depth of 80% by a sinusoidal audio signal of 1 kHz, and stepped frequency increments of either 50 kHz or 1% frequency increment over the range 150 kHz to 80 MHz.
   - The test level is severity level 2, corresponding to 3 V rms at a transfer impedance of 150 Ω.

6. **References**:
   - Specific subclauses and tables in TS 36.101 are referenced for measurement parameters, including Table 7.3.1-1 and Table 7.3.1-2 for reference test channels.

These procedures ensure that E-UTRA devices meet the required standards for immunity and emissions, maintaining reliable performance and user control functions during and after testing.","The answer should cover the setup and conditions for communication links in traffic and idle modes, methods for identifying and disregarding narrow band responses, performance criteria for data transfer and speech modes, and detailed test methods for immunity and emissions testing according to IEC standards.

  - They must also support multipart MIME content.
  - The MIME type for Tariff Information is 'application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml', and this information must be transported as a SIP MIME body. Any SIP message carrying Tariff Information must identify the payload with this MIME type.
  - If the User Equipment (UE) does not indicate support for the MIME type associated with Tariff Information in the Accept header, the CDP should assume that the UE supports version 1.0 of this MIME type.
  - When both 'sv' and 'schemaversion' parameters are present, the CDP should ignore the 'schemaversion' parameter.
  - If the CDP includes the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body, it must set the Content-Type header field to the MIME type associated with Tariff Information and include the versions of the XML schema that can validate the body in the 'sv' or 'schemaversion' parameter.
  - The CGP must include the Accept header field with 'application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml' and indicate the versions of the XML Schema for SIP Transfer of Tariff Information it supports. Additionally, it should list any other MIME types it is willing and capable of accepting.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the structure and components of the URI used in HTTP requests for 5GC SBI APIs, specifically focusing on the Nudr-dr API.","The URI used in HTTP requests for 5GC SBI APIs, particularly for the Nudr-dr API, follows a specific structure defined in 3GPP TS 29.504 and TS 29.501. The general format of the URI is:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>

Each component of the URI is defined as follows:

1. {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts:
   - Scheme: Either 'http' or 'https'. Both are allowed, but security considerations for using 'https' are detailed in clause 13.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501.
   - Fixed string '://'
   - Authority: This includes the host and optional port, as defined in IETF RFC 3986. The host should be represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

Describe the test purposes and procedures for PDCP Data PDU handling in different scenarios as specified in TS 38.523 section 14.2.3.2.,"The test purposes and procedures for PDCP Data PDU handling in different scenarios as specified in TS 38.523 section 14.2.3.2 involve several key conditions and expected behaviors of the User Equipment (UE). 

Firstly, when the UE is in the RRC_Connected state with a Multicast MRB established and PDCP configured for 18-bit Sequence Number (SN), the handling of PDCP Data PDU is based on the RCVD_COUNT and initialRX-DELIV values. Specifically:
1. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT less than initialRX-DELIV, the UE is expected to discard the PDCP Data PDU.
2. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT equal to initialRX-DELIV, the UE should deliver the PDCP Data PDU to the upper layers.

Additionally, during non-lossless handover scenarios with PDCP re-establishment, the handling of PDCP Data PDU is similarly based on the RCVD_COUNT and initialRX-DELIV values:
1. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT less than initialRX-DELIV, the UE should discard the PDCP Data PDU.
2. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT equal to initialRX-DELIV, the UE should deliver the PDCP Data PDU to the upper layers.

In cases where initialRX-DELIV-r17 in PDCP-Config is not configured, the UE's behavior is based on the RX_DELIV value:
1. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT less than RX_DELIV, the UE should discard the PDCP Data PDU.
2. If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT equal to RX_DELIV, the UE should deliver the PDCP Data PDU to the upper layers.

The conformance requirements, pre-test conditions, test procedure sequence, and specific message contents for these tests are consistent with those outlined in clause 14.2.3.1.2, 14.2.3.1.3.1, 14.2.3.1.3.2, and 14.2.3.1.3.3 respectively, with specific exceptions noted in Tables 14.2.3.2.3.3-6 and 14.2.3.2.3.3-11.","Key details the answer must include:

Explain the handling of criticality information in SABP messages as defined in 3GPP TS 25.419.,"In SABP messages, criticality information is used to instruct the receiver on how to act when receiving an Information Element (IE) or an IE group that is not comprehended. This criticality information is crucial for ensuring proper message handling and error management. The three possible values of criticality information for an IE or IE group are: Reject IE, Ignore IE and Notify Sender, and Ignore IE.

1. **Reject IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE', none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information received is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the procedure shall be terminated, and the Error Indication procedure initiated. Similarly, if a response message is missing IEs/IE groups with 'Reject IE' criticality, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

2. **Ignore IE and Notify Sender**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The missing IEs/IE groups shall be reported in the response message. If the initiating message lacks sufficient information for all required IEs, the procedure shall be terminated, and the Error Indication procedure initiated. For response messages, the missing IEs/IE groups shall be ignored, and the Error Indication procedure initiated to report the missing elements.

3. **Ignore IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The same applies to response messages.

Additional rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group, or an EP not comprehended and when action based on criticality information is applicable. For instance, if one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity, although some may remain unsupported. The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated, and any unsupported EP may be considered not comprehended, with action based on criticality applied.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE' or 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. The Repetition Number IE and, if applicable, the Message Structure IE shall also be included.

Overall, the handling of criticality information ensures that SABP messages are processed correctly, with appropriate actions taken for missing or uncomprehended elements, thereby maintaining the integrity and functionality of communication procedures.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Definition and purpose of criticality information in SABP messages.

"How does the UDM store the authentication status of the UE according to TS 33.514, and what are the steps to verify this process?","According to TS 33.514, the UDM is required to store the authentication status of the UE, which includes the SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier), authentication result, timestamp, and the serving network name. This requirement is referenced in TS 33.501, clause 6.1.4.1a.

To verify this process, the test case TC_AUTH_STATUS_STORE_UDM is used. The purpose of this test case is to ensure that the UDM under test accurately stores the authentication status of the UE, which should match the authentication information exchanged between the AUSF (Authentication Server Function) and the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function).

The pre-conditions for this test include:
- The UDM network product must be connected with an AUSF in a simulated or real network environment involving an AMF and eNB (evolved Node B).
- The tester must have access to all authentication-specific data sent over the N1, N12, and N13 interfaces.
- The tester must have access to the UDM under test.

The execution steps are as follows:
1. Capture the entire authentication procedure and authentication confirmation procedure over the N12 and N13 interfaces using a network analyzer.
2. Filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message sent over the N13 interface to retrieve the serving network name.
3. Filter the Nudm_Authentication_Get Response message sent over the N13 interface to find the SUPI.
4. Filter the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message sent over the N12 interface to retrieve the authentication result (EAP success/failure for EAP-AKA' or Result for 5G AKA).
5. Filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message to retrieve the authentication result and timestamp sent from the AUSF to the UDM over the N13 interface.
6. Compare the serving network name stored in the UDM against the serving network name retrieved from the Nudm_Authentication_Get Request message and the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.
7. Compare the authentication status stored in the UDM against the authentication result retrieved from the N12 interface.
8. Compare the SUPI stored in the UDM against the SUPI retrieved from the Nudm_Authentication_Get Response message and the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.
9. Compare the timestamp stored in the UDM against the time of the authentication procedure retrieved from the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.

The expected result is that the UDM correctly stores the authentication status (SUPI, authentication result, timestamp, and serving network name) of the UE. Evidence of this verification can be presented in the form of screenshots or screen captures.

Note: This test case does not apply to deployment scenarios where the UDM and AUSF network products are collocated without an open N13 interface.","The answer should include the requirement for UDM to store authentication status of the UE, including SUPI, authentication result, timestamp, and serving network name.

"Describe the process and conditions under which an IWF handles a SIP SUBSCRIBE request for MCPTT group dynamic data, and how it notifies the subscriber about changes in the per-group dynamic data.","The process and conditions under which an Interworking Function (IWF) handles a SIP SUBSCRIBE request for Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) group dynamic data involve several specific steps and requirements. 

Firstly, the SIP SUBSCRIBE request must meet certain conditions:
1. The Request-URI must contain the public service identity of the IWF owning the served MCPTT group.
2. The request must include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body containing the <mcptt-request-uri> and <mcptt-calling-user-id> elements.
3. The ICSI value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt' must be present in a P-Asserted-Service header field.
4. The Event header field must contain the 'presence' event type.
5. The request must include an application/simple-filter+xml MIME body indicating per-group dynamic data of presence event package notification information.

Upon receiving a valid SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the IWF performs the following actions:
1. Identifies the served MCPTT group ID from the <mcptt-request-uri> element.
2. Identifies the handled MCPTT ID from the <mcptt-calling-user-id> element.
3. If the Expires header field is not included or has a nonzero value lower than 4294967295, the IWF sends a SIP 423 (Interval Too Brief) response and does not proceed further.
4. If the MCPTT group for the served MCPTT group ID does not exist, the IWF rejects the request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.
5. If the IWF does not support receiving the request, it sends a SIP 501 (Not Implemented) response.
6. If the handled MCPTT ID is not authorized to subscribe to the group dynamic data, the IWF rejects the request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.
7. If all conditions are met, the IWF generates a SIP 200 (OK) response.

For the duration of the subscription, the IWF notifies the subscriber about changes in the per-group dynamic data of the served MCPTT group ID. This involves:
1. Considering an MCPTT group information entry that matches the served MCPTT group ID.
2. Generating an application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-group dynamic data, including the 'expires' attribute in the <affiliation> element.
3. Sending a SIP NOTIFY request with the generated MIME body to the subscriber.

"Describe the procedures and key elements involved in the establishment, maintenance, and release of SCCP connections between the MSC and BSS as defined in 3GPP TS 48.006.","The establishment, maintenance, and release of SCCP connections between the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and the Base Station System (BSS) are crucial for supporting signalling messages in mobile networks. These procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 48.006 and involve several key elements:

1. **Role of SCCP and BSSAP**: The Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) and the Base Station System Application Part (BSSAP) are used to support signalling messages between the MSC and the BSS. BSSAP is further subdivided into two functions: Direct Transfer Application sub-Part (DTAP) and BSS Management Application sub-Part (BSSMAP). DTAP transfers messages between the MSC and the Mobile Station (MS) without interpretation by the BSS, while BSSMAP supports procedures related to resource management, handover control, and other functions between the MSC and the BSS.

2. **Connection-Oriented and Connectionless Procedures**: BSSMAP uses both connection-oriented and connectionless procedures. Connection-oriented procedures are used to support DTAP, while connectionless services are used for certain BSSMAP procedures. The choice between these services is explained in 3GPP TS 48.008.

3. **User Data Field in SCCP Frames**: The user data field in SCCP frames contains DTAP or BSSMAP Layer 3 messages. This field is optional for Connection Request (CR), Connection Confirm (CC), and Connection Refused (CREF) frames, but mandatory for Data frames (DT). The structure of the user data field in unit data messages (UDT) includes a distribution data unit, a length indicator, and the actual layer 3 message.

4. **Establishment of SCCP Connections**: SCCP connections are established in various scenarios:
   - For point-to-point calls, a new SCCP connection is established when dedicated radio resources are allocated and no existing connection is available.
   - For voice group or broadcast calls, connections are established for each cell involved, additional connections for each BSS, and optionally for particular participants.
   - During external handovers, new SCCP connections are established to reserve dedicated radio resources in the new BSS.

5. **Release of SCCP Connections**: The release of SCCP connections is always initiated by the MSC when a signalling connection is no longer required. This can occur in normal cases, such as the termination of a BSSAP release procedure or failure of resource allocation during handover. In abnormal cases, connection failures are detected by the connection supervision service provided by SCCP, with procedures specified in 3GPP TS 48.008.

Overall, the procedures for SCCP connections ensure efficient communication and resource management between the MSC and BSS, supporting various call types and handover scenarios in mobile networks.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of SCCP and BSSAP in supporting signalling messages between MSC and BSS.
- The distinction between DTAP and BSSMAP sub-parts and their respective functions.
- The use of connection-oriented and connectionless procedures for BSSMAP and DTAP.
- The structure and mandatory/optional use of the user data field in SCCP frames.
- The specific procedures for establishing SCCP connections in various scenarios, including point-to-point calls, voice group or broadcast calls, and external handovers.
- The process for releasing SCCP connections initiated by the MSC, including both normal and abnormal cases."
Describe the RF-budget considerations for different classes of GSM mobile stations and the specific requirements for various types of BTS as defined in 3GPP specifications.,"The RF-budget considerations for GSM mobile stations vary depending on the class of the device. For GSM 900 class 4 mobile stations, the RF-output peak power is 2 W. The Ec/No and C/Ic values for achieving a residual BER of 0.4% are determined using multi-path profiles as defined in the 3GPP TS 45.005 annex 3, with a bandwidth of 54 dBHz. The uncorrelated carrier and interference signals have a 75% location probability, which corresponds to approximately 90% area coverage, based on a lognormal distribution of shadowing with a standard deviation of 7 dB. Additionally, a path loss of 9 dB is assumed due to the handheld MEG (antenna/body loss) of -9 dBi. The maximum range is calculated using the Hata model, with antenna heights of 50 m for the BTS and 1.5 m for the mobile station, and an indoor loss of 15 dB.

For GSM class 2 mobile stations, the RF-output peak power is 8 W. The Ec/No and C/Ic values for achieving a residual BER of 0.2% are also determined using multi-path profiles as defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 annex 3, with the same bandwidth of 54 dBHz. The uncorrelated carrier and interference signals have a 75% location probability, corresponding to approximately 90% area coverage, based on a lognormal distribution of shadowing with a standard deviation of 7 dB. The maximum range in quasi-open areas is calculated using the Hata model, with antenna heights of 100 m for the BTS and 1.5 m for the mobile station.

Regarding the specific requirements for various types of BTS, the micro-BTS differs from a normal BTS in two main ways: the range requirements are much reduced, and the close proximity requirements are more stringent. The micro-BTS is designed to be small and cost-effective for external street deployment in large numbers, necessitating a different set of RF parameters. For indoor environments, the pico-BTS extends the micro-BTS concept, requiring different RF parameters due to very low delay spread, low speed, and small cell sizes.

The multicarrier BTS is characterized by its ability to process multiple carriers simultaneously in common active RF components, either in the transmitter only or both the transmitter and receiver. It is divided into Wide Area, Medium Range, and Local Area classes for different deployment conditions. The requirements for a normal BTS apply to all classes of multicarrier BTS unless otherwise specified. Vendors must declare if the multicarrier BTS supports non-contiguous frequency allocation, defined as an allocation with at least 5.4 MHz carrier separation between the innermost carriers. The term maximum Base Station RF bandwidth refers to the maximum RF bandwidth in which a multicarrier BTS can transmit or transmit and receive multiple carriers simultaneously.","The answer must include details on the RF-budget considerations for GSM 900 class 4 and class 2 mobile stations, including RF-output peak power, Ec/No and C/Ic values for residual BER, multi-path profiles, location probability, shadowing distribution, path loss, and range calculations based on Hata model. Additionally, it should cover the specific requirements for micro-BTS, pico-BTS, and multicarrier BTS, including differences from normal BTS, deployment conditions, RF parameters, and vendor declarations for frequency allocation."
Describe the offline charging models and CDR generation process for PoC services as specified in 3GPP TS 32.272.,"The offline charging models for Push-to-Talk over Cellular (PoC) services, as specified in 3GPP TS 32.272, involve the generation of Charging Data Records (CDRs) for the charged parties configured in the PoC Server.

The accumulated or detailed talk burst usage data in the CDRs will include information on duration, volume, and the number of talk bursts, which the Billing Domain (BD) will rate according to selected rate plans.

Different types of CDRs are generated for PoC services, including event CDRs for early session establishment and instant personal alerts delivery, interim CDRs for ongoing session participation and talk burst usage, and final CDRs for the conclusion of PoC sessions. The generation of interim CDRs is governed by configurable timers at the PoC Server, changes to the session, and any changes in the user's location that are made known to the PoC Server.","The answer should include a description of the offline charging models for PoC services, the types of CDRs generated (event, interim, and final), the data contained in these CDRs (duration, volume, number of talk bursts), and the factors governing the generation of interim CDRs (configurable timers, session changes, user location changes)."

What are the requirements and functionalities of the P-CSCF in relation to SigComp as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.229 documents?,"The Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF) has several requirements and functionalities related to SigComp as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.229 documents. 

Firstly, the P-CSCF must support SigComp as outlined in RFC 3320 and updated by RFC 4896. Additionally, it must adhere to the requirements specified in RFC 5049, with the exception that the P-CSCF must take a State Memory Size of at least 4096 bytes as a minimum value. The P-CSCF may also support the negative acknowledgement mechanism specified in RFC 4077.

When using SigComp, the P-CSCF is required to send compressed SIP messages in accordance with RFC 3486.

What are the synchronization requirements and methods for gNBs as specified in TS 38.401 9.1?,"The synchronization requirements for gNBs as specified in TS 38.401 9.1 include the support for logical synchronization ports for phase, time, and frequency synchronization. For phase and time synchronization, the logical synchronization port must provide accuracy that meets the gNB requirements on maximum relative phase difference for all gNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast areas. Additionally, it must provide continuous time without leap seconds traceable to a common time reference, which should be traceable to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in non-isolated networks.

The common SFN (System Frame Number) initialization time is crucial for synchronized TDD-unicast areas and should be set to 1980-01-06T00:00:19 International Atomic Time (TAI), unless otherwise agreed by operators. The start of the radio frame on the output must be synchronous with the input time reference, aligning with the start time of the UTC second when required.

For frequency synchronization, gNBs connected via TDM interfaces must consider the jitter and wander performance requirements in accordance with ITU-T Recommendations G.823, G.824, or G.825, depending on the applicable network limits.

"How do the 3GPP documents address the requirements and challenges of XR services, particularly in terms of uplink video traffic and device architectures?","The 3GPP documents address the requirements and challenges of XR services through several key points. Document 1 highlights the necessity of uplink video for XR services, particularly for use cases such as AR guided assistance in remote locations and industrial services, which require one or two video streams in the uplink. It also discusses potential bottlenecks in uplink capacity, which may arise due to the configuration of NR networks for less capacity in the uplink compared to the downlink. This could impact the transmission of time-critical pose information when additional uplink video traffic is present. Document 3 provides a comprehensive framework for XR, including the analysis of QoE/QoS issues, the delivery of XR in 5G systems, and the introduction of new delivery categories like split compute/rendering.

How is the charging identifier used in 3GPP TS 32.290 for correlating charging information and handling retries?,"In 3GPP TS 32.290, the charging identifier plays a crucial role in correlating charging information and handling retries. The charging identifier is assigned by the NF consumer, which allows for the correlation of charging information across different events or sessions. This identifier is also utilized for duplicate detection, ensuring that repeated charging data requests are recognized and managed appropriately.

When a NF consumer (CTF) does not receive a Charging Data Response, it may retransmit the Charging Data Request message. The number of retries and the delay between retries are configured locally within the NF consumer. For the retried charging data request [Initial], the uniqueness checking is based on the Charging Identifier included in the request. The CHF responds to the retried request with the original charging session identifier.

For retried requests that are charging data request [Update] or charging data request [Termination], the uniqueness checking involves inspecting the Charging Session Identifier and Invocation Sequence Number pair. The Invocation Sequence Number in the retried message remains the same as the original message and is not incremented. If a Session Failover indication is received from the CHF, the NF consumer may send the retried message to an alternative CHF, as defined in clause 5.23.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501.

Additionally, in the case of a notification request timeout, the CHF may retry the message, with the number of retries and delay between retries being locally configured within the CHF. This mechanism ensures that charging data requests are handled efficiently and accurately, maintaining the integrity of the charging process.","The answer should explain the role of the charging identifier in correlating charging information and detecting duplicates. It should also cover the retry mechanism, including the conditions under which retries occur, how uniqueness is checked, and the handling of session failover."

1. **Sensitivity Requirement**:
   - **Target Sensitivity Levels**: The sensitivity requirement is crucial for verifying the performance of the MBS receiver in weak signal conditions. The target sensitivity level is set at -130 dBm at the UE antenna connector across the signal bandwidth.
   - **Test Conditions**: The sensitivity test case is performed in an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel to test the most stringent signal levels for the beacons. This ensures the UE MBS performance at the lowest expected signal levels.
   - **Measurement Accuracy**: The test case requirements for sensitivity measurement accuracy are detailed in clause A.4.2 of TS 37.171.

2. **Dynamic Range Requirement**:
   - **Maximum Signal Levels**: The dynamic range requirement tests the performance of the MBS receiver under time-varying signal conditions. The maximum signal level of an MBS beacon is expected to be -30 dBm at the UE antenna connector. This is theoretically derived from a TX power of +40 dBm and a minimum coupling loss of 70 dB.
   - **Test Conditions**: For this requirement, the power level of the MBS beacons alternates between the strongest and weakest expected levels across consecutive slots in the MBS transmission period.
   - **Measurement Accuracy**: The test case requirements for dynamic range measurement accuracy are also found in clause A.4.2 of TS 37.171.

"Describe the coding rules and structure for channel type and resource type elements in TS 48.008, including how the number of channels is represented and any relevant signalling field elements.","TS 48.008 provides detailed coding rules and structure for channel type and resource type elements, which are essential for managing and reporting the availability of channels in a cellular network. 

The coding rules for channel type elements are defined using specific bit values. For example, the Channel type field (bits 1-4 of octets 3, 5, etc.) is coded as follows:
- 0001 represents SDCCH (Stand-alone Dedicated Control Channel)
- 1000 represents Full Rate TCH (Traffic Channel)
- 1001 represents Half Rate TCH
All other values are reserved for future use.

The Resource and interference band indicator field (bits 5-8 of octets 3, 5, etc.) is coded to indicate the number of channels accessible or available in specific interference bands:
- 0000 indicates the total number of channels accessible
- 0001 to 0101 indicate the number of channels available in interference bands 1 to 5 respectively
- 1110 indicates the number of channels available without supplied interference band classification
All other values are reserved.

The Number of channels octets (octets 4, 6, etc.) can be a single octet element if the 7/15 indication bit (bit 8 of octets 4, 6, etc.) is set to 0, or a two octet field if the bit is set to 1. This provides a 7 or 15 bit binary representation of the number of channels with the resource type indicated in the nearest preceding resource type octet. The coding convention for fields extending over more than one octet is defined in sub-clause 3.2.2.

Additionally, the coding rules for signalling field elements are consistent with those defined for signalling elements in sub-clause 3.2.2. Signalling field elements must always include a Field Length indicator, and a Field Length indicator with a value of zero is not considered an error. All other values are reserved for future use.

"Describe the procedures for activating and deactivating UE test mode in different states and scenarios, and explain how antenna information is requested from the UE.","The procedures for activating and deactivating UE test mode vary depending on the state of the UE and the communication technology involved. 

For activation:
1. When the UE is in E-UTRA or NB-IoT connected state, the SS can activate the UE test mode by transmitting an ACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
2. When the UE capable of V2X communication is in out-of-coverage state, the SS can activate the UE test mode by transmitting an AT Command +CATM=<status1>.

For deactivation:
1. When the UE is in E-UTRA or NB-IoT connected state, the SS can deactivate the UE test mode by transmitting a DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
2. When the UE capable of V2X communication is in out-of-coverage state, the SS can deactivate the UE test mode by transmitting an AT Command +CATM=<status=0>.
3. In V2X test scenarios, the deactivation method depends on the UE V2X state at the time the deactivation command needs to be sent. If the test starts with the UE in V2X in-coverage state and transitions to out-of-coverage state, the test loop mode is activated using the ACTIVATE TEST MODE command and deactivated using the AT command.

Additionally, when the UE is in E-UTRA connected state, the SS can request the UE to report its current value of the state variable SCPTM_PACKET_COUNTER by transmitting a UE TEST LOOP MODE F SCPTM PACKET COUNTER REQUEST message.

For requesting antenna information:
When the UE is in E-UTRA connected state, the SS can request antenna information by sending an ANTENNA INFORMATION REQUEST message, which specifies the desired carrier number (CN). The mapping from CN to carrier is as follows:
- CN = 0: Primary serving cell

Describe the key elements and mechanisms involved in MBMS user service announcement and discovery as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.246.,"The MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) user service announcement and discovery mechanisms are designed to inform users about the range of available MBMS user services, including operator-specific services and services from external content providers. The key elements involved in MBMS user service announcement include the distribution of information about the service, parameters required for service activation (such as IP multicast addresses), and other service-related parameters like service start time.

Several mechanisms can be employed for MBMS user service announcement and discovery, which may vary depending on the terminal's capabilities and the user's location. These mechanisms include:
- SMS Cell Broadcast to advertise MBMS Multicast and Broadcast user services.
- MBMS Broadcast mode to advertise MBMS Multicast and Broadcast user services.
- MBMS Multicast mode to advertise MBMS Multicast user services.
- PUSH mechanisms such as WAP, SMS-PP, and MMS.
- URLs using HTTP or FTP.

Operators and service providers may choose the most suitable method to inform users about MBMS user services, taking into account factors like the user's current cell, whether they are in the Home PLMN (HPLMN) or Visited PLMN (VPLMN). Users who have not yet subscribed to an MBMS user service should also be able to discover these services.

The reference architecture for GPRS to support the MBMS bearer service includes network entities and reference points, such as the Iu/Gn reference point, which is a direct tunnel with IP multicast-based addressing. This architecture is crucial for enabling the MBMS user service announcement and discovery mechanisms.

While the details of the MBMS service announcement mechanisms are beyond the scope of the specification, MBMS allows the utilization of solutions using IETF protocols. Service announcement is further defined within MBMS User Service specifications TS 26.346.","The answer should cover the reference architecture for GPRS supporting MBMS bearer service, highlighting the network entities and reference points involved. It should also detail the various mechanisms for MBMS user service announcement and discovery, including SMS Cell Broadcast, MBMS Broadcast mode, MBMS Multicast mode, PUSH mechanisms, and URLs. Additionally, it should mention the considerations for user location and the use of IETF protocols."

"How does the UE indicate support for reflective QoS function during EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' based authentication, and how does the 3GPP AAA server respond to this indication?","During EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' based authentication, the User Equipment (UE) can indicate its support for the reflective QoS function by using the AT_RQSI_IND attribute. This indication is sent within the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge message payload or the EAP-Response'/AKA-Challenge' message payload when EAP-AKA' is used. The UE provides this indication if it receives the AT_RESULT_IND attribute within the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge message or the EAP-Request'/AKA-Challenge' message when EAP-AKA' is used. Additionally, if the UE includes the AT_RQSI_IND attribute, it must also include the AT_RESULT_IND attribute within the same message.

The 3GPP AAA server, upon receiving the UE's indication of support for the reflective QoS function, includes the AT_RESULT_IND attribute within the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge and the corresponding EAP-AKA' message payload. If the UE has provided an explicit indication of support, the 3GPP AAA server will inform the UE of its decision regarding the reflective QoS function by invoking an EAP-Request/AKA-Notification dialogue or an EAP-Request'/AKA-Notification' dialogue when EAP-AKA' is used. The decision is communicated to the UE using the AT_RQSI_RES attribute. This decision is based on the capabilities of the UE, the type of access, the access identity, and local policies.

How should the MCData function handle the establishment and management of MSRP sessions and the sending of SDS messages according to 3GPP TS 24.582?,"According to 3GPP TS 24.582, the MCData function must handle the establishment and management of MSRP sessions and the sending of SDS messages as follows:

1. The participating MCData function must act as an 'active' endpoint if the 'a=setup' attribute in the received SDP answer is set to 'passive', and as a 'passive' endpoint if the 'a=setup' attribute in the received SDP answer is set to 'active'. Additionally, the MSRP connection must be established according to the MSRP connection parameters in the received SDP answer response as described in IETF RFC 4976.

2. The originating participating MCData function should establish the MSRP session with the controlling MCData function as specified in clause 6.2.1.3.

3. Upon receiving an MSRP SEND request from the originating MCData client, the originating participating MCData function must:
   - Verify that the SDS message size is less than or equal to the <MacData1To1> element of the MCData user profile document for the originating MCData client.

"Describe the data coding process for both uplink and downlink as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003, including the parity bits, tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.","The data coding process for both uplink and downlink as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003 involves several steps, including the calculation of parity bits, addition of tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.

1. **Parity Bits Calculation**:
   Twelve data parity bits p(0), p(1), ..., p(11) are defined such that in GF(2), the binary polynomial formed by the data bits and parity bits, when divided by the polynomial D12 + D11 + D10 + D8 + D5 + D4 + 1, yields a remainder equal to D11 + D10 + D9 + D8 + D7 + D6 + D5 + D4 + D3 + D2 + D + 1.

2. **Addition of Tail Bits**:
   Six tail bits equal to 0 are added to the information and parity bits, resulting in a block of 564 bits {u(0), u(1), ..., u(563)}. The bits are assigned as follows:
   - u(k) = d(k+40) for k = 0, 1, ..., 545
   - u(k) = p(k-546) for k = 546, 547, ..., 557
   - u(k) = 0 for k = 558, 559, ..., 563 (tail bits)

3. **Convolutional Encoding**:
   This block of 564 bits is encoded using the 1/3 rate convolutional mother code defined by the polynomials:
   - G4 = 1 + D2 + D3 + D5 + D6
   - G7 = 1 + D + D2 + D3 + D6
   - G5 = 1 + D + D4 + D6
   The encoding results in a block of 1692 coded bits {C(0), C(1), ..., C(1691)}, where:
   - C(3k) = u(k) + u(k-2) + u(k-3) + u(k-5) + u(k-6)
   - C(3k+1) = u(k) + u(k-1) + u(k-2) + u(k-3) + u(k-6)
   - C(3k+2) = u(k) + u(k-1) + u(k-4) + u(k-6) for k = 0, 1, ..., 563; u(k) = 0 for k < 0

4. **Puncturing Schemes**:
   The code is punctured depending on the value of the CPS field, resulting in three puncturing schemes named P1, P2, or P3. This results in a block of 612 coded bits {c1(0), c1(1), ..., c1(611)}. For the FANR procedure, if the PANI field is set to 0, the puncturing is the same as for EGPRS. If the PANI field is set to 1, additional bits are punctured, resulting in a block of 576 coded bits {pc1(0), pc1(1), ..., pc1(575)}.

5. **Second Half Data Coding**:
   The same data coding process is applied to the second half, with bits {d(40), d(41), ..., d(585)} replaced by bits {d(586), d(587), ..., d(1131)}. This results in a block of 612 coded bits {c2(0), c2(1), ..., c2(611)}. If the PANI field is set to 1, additional bits are punctured, resulting in a block of 576 coded bits {pc2(0), pc2(1), ..., pc2(575)}.

For the downlink, the data coding process is confirmed to be the same as for the uplink, with bits {d(40), d(41), ..., d(1131)} replaced by bits {d(46), d(47), ..., d(1137)}.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Detailed explanation of the parity bits calculation and the polynomial used.
  - Description of the addition of tail bits and the formation of the block of 564 bits.

"Describe the link performance characterization and comparison of SAIC receivers to conventional receivers, including the principles of link-to-system modeling as outlined in TS 45.903.","The link performance of SAIC (Single Antenna Interference Cancellation) receivers is characterized by evaluating their ability to handle interference compared to conventional receivers. The characterization includes long-term link level performance, which is summarized and compared to conventional receivers. Simulation results are presented for various link interference models, corresponding to different network configurations. Two key performance measures are considered: the Carrier-to-Interference Ratio (CIR) required to achieve a decoded frame erasure rate (FER) of less than 1%, and the CIR required to achieve a raw bit error rate (BER) of less than 10%.

The principles of link-to-system modeling involve estimating the performance of each link based on the current interference situation. This is achieved through a two-stage mapping process. In the first stage, burst level CIR samples are mapped onto the raw bit error probability (BEP) for a burst. In the second stage, BEP samples of one speech frame are grouped together to estimate the frame error probability (FEP). The FEP value is then used to determine whether the particular frame was in error.

For SAIC receivers, the interference environment significantly impacts performance, making it necessary to use both CIR and DIR (Desired-to-Interference Ratio) to characterize the interference situation in a burst. The link-to-system interface for SAIC receivers maps burst CIR and DIR to burst BEP in the first stage, and then proceeds to the second stage as described.

Detailed simulation results and performance curves for SAIC receivers are provided, illustrating burst-wise and frame-wise performance mapping. Burst-wise performance is achieved by logging DIR, CIR, and raw BER from each burst in a link level simulation, and binning the bursts in a two-dimensional grid based on DIR and CIR. Frame-wise performance is achieved similarly, with the addition of logging frame errors after channel decoding. The resulting performance curves are presented as functions of burst CIR and mean(BEP), parameterized with DIR and std(BEP) respectively.","The answer should include the characterization of SAIC receivers' link performance, a comparison to conventional receivers, and the principles of link-to-system modeling. It should detail the long-term link level performance, simulation results, and performance measures (CIR for FER and raw BER). Additionally, it should describe the link-to-system interface, the mapping of CIR to frame erasure rate, and the impact of the interference environment on SAIC receiver performance. Finally, it should cover the detailed simulation results and performance curves for SAIC receivers, including burst-wise and frame-wise performance mapping."
"Describe the process and conditions under which the terminal equipment (TE) and mobile termination (MT) exit SMS/CBS mode and return to default mode, including the relevant commands and indications involved.","The process and conditions for the terminal equipment (TE) and mobile termination (MT) to exit SMS/CBS mode and return to default mode involve several steps and commands. When the TE wishes to return to default mode from SMS/CBS mode, it issues the command 'END SMS MODE' as described in clause 2.4.1.11. The MT responds with 'OK' (or 0) to indicate that the DTE/DCE interface has returned to default mode. The TE will change back to default mode regardless of whether such a response is received.

The TE may also indicate its exit from SMS/CBS mode through the use of CT 108/2. If an incoming data call arrives while the DTE/DCE interface is set to SMS/CBS mode, the MT may autonomously issue the 'END SMS MODE' indication (clause 2.4.2.11) and revert to default mode to connect the data call through the TAF. Additionally, the MT may exit SMS/CBS mode autonomously if the power is switched off and then on again. The MT manufacturer may provide a Man-Machine Interface (MMI) to change the mode back to default mode, in which case the MT will issue the 'END SMS MODE' indication and exit SMS/CBS mode immediately.

The MT may also indicate its exit from SMS/CBS mode through the use of CT 107 and CT 109. A BREAK condition in either direction at the DTE/DCE interface will cause both the TE and the MT to exit SMS/CBS block mode and return to default mode. If the TE or MT encounter a protocol error and are unable to recover, either entity may exit SMS/CBS mode using any of the mechanisms described above. Confirmation of default mode operation is achieved through the use of AT commands and responses.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The 'END SMS MODE' command issued by TE to MT and the expected response.
- Autonomous exit conditions for MT, including power cycling and manufacturer-provided MMI.
- Indications used by TE and MT to signal exit from SMS/CBS mode (CT 108/2, CT 107, CT 109).
- The role of a BREAK condition in exiting SMS/CBS mode.
- Confirmation of default mode operation through AT commands and responses."
Explain the mechanisms and configurations for delivering multicast and broadcast services in NR systems as defined in 3GPP TS 38.300.,"In NR systems, multicast and broadcast services are delivered efficiently using specific mechanisms and configurations as defined in 3GPP TS 38.300.

For broadcast communication services, the same service and specific content data are provided simultaneously to all UEs within a geographical area. This service is delivered using a broadcast session, and UEs can receive the broadcast communication service in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE, and RRC_CONNECTED states. Broadcast services are configured using broadcast RRC signaling, and the gNB provides a broadcast MRB configuration with one DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission.

For multicast communication services, the same service and specific content data are provided simultaneously to a dedicated set of UEs. This service is delivered using a multicast session, and UEs can receive the multicast communication service in the RRC_CONNECTED state. Multicast services can be delivered using two methods: PTP transmission, where gNB delivers separate copies of MBS data packets to each UE independently, and PTM transmission, where gNB delivers a single copy of MBS data packets to a set of UEs. The gNB dynamically decides whether to deliver multicast data by PTM leg and/or PTP leg based on criteria such as MBS Session QoS requirements, number of joined UEs, UE individual feedback on reception quality, and other factors. The same QoS requirements apply regardless of the delivery method.

The downlink Layer 2 architecture for multicast and broadcast sessions comprises the same layer 2 sublayers as described in clause 6, with specific functionalities for SDAP and PDCP sublayers. The SDAP sublayer provides mapping between an MBS QoS flow and an MRB and transfer of user plane data. The PDCP sublayer provides transfer of user plane data, maintenance of PDCP SNs, header compression and decompression using ROHC or EHC protocols, reordering and in-order delivery, and duplicate discarding.

For multicast sessions, gNB provides various multicast MRB configurations to the UE via dedicated RRC signaling, including configurations with DL only RLC-UM, bidirectional RLC-UM, and RLC-AM entities for PTP transmission, and DL only RLC-UM entities for PTM transmission. The gNB may change the MRB type using RRC signaling and may use the RRCReconfiguration message to configure or reconfigure a multicast MRB, including adding, releasing, or modifying the MRB's RLC entities. To minimize data loss during MRB reconfiguration, the gNB may configure the UE to send a PDCP status report.

Overall, NR systems utilize efficient mechanisms and configurations to deliver multicast and broadcast services, ensuring optimal resource utilization and service quality.","The answer must include the definitions and states for receiving multicast and broadcast services, the differences between multicast and broadcast communication services, the methods for delivering multicast data packets (PTP and PTM transmission), the dynamic decision criteria for gNB, the QoS requirements, the downlink Layer 2 architecture for multicast and broadcast sessions, the functionalities of SDAP and PDCP sublayers, the multicast and broadcast MRB configurations, the use of RRCReconfiguration message for configuring/reconfiguring multicast MRB, and the mechanisms to minimize data loss during MRB reconfiguration."
"Describe the error handling mechanisms and field element processing rules for the Old BSS to New BSS Information, New BSS to Old BSS Information, and Inter-System Information elements as defined in 3GPP TS 48.008.","The error handling mechanisms and field element processing rules for the Old BSS to New BSS Information, New BSS to Old BSS Information, and Inter-System Information elements are defined in 3GPP TS 48.008. 

Generic error handling rules applicable to all field elements are outlined in sub-clause 3.1.19.7. All field elements are treated as non-essential, and the following events are not regarded as errors by the recipient:
- Spare bits with an unexpected value in any field element.
- The use of additional octets in any field element.
- A missing field element.
- A field element whose length is either too short or too long.

When the recipient detects one or more of these events, the receiving entity shall ignore the information it is unable to understand and treat the message based on the remaining information. Specifically:
- Unknown field element identifiers are skipped, and the receiver continues processing any remaining field elements.
- If more field elements of a particular type are received than expected, the last ones are ignored.
- If a sub-field in a field element contains an incorrect value, the recipient either ignores that sub-field or the entire field.
- If a sub-field in a field element contains a reserved value, the recipient ignores the entire field element.

For the Old BSS to New BSS Information elements, as defined in sub-clause 3.2.2.58, the length indicator (octet 2) is a binary number indicating the absolute length of the contents after the length indicator octet and may be set to zero. Field elements may occur in any order, and the receiver can ignore unknown field elements. Due to backward compatibility issues, field elements in the Old BSS to New BSS Information may duplicate information from Information Elements in the HANDOVER REQUEST. If an inconsistency is detected, the information in the Old BSS to New BSS Information takes precedence as long as the coding is understood. Reception of erroneous Old BSS to New BSS Information does not cause rejection of the HANDOVER REQUEST message; the information element is discarded, and the handover resource allocation procedure continues. The D-RNTI field element is present only when a Radio Resource Reserve Handover procedure is applied over the Iur-g interface, and the Source Cell ID field element is present only if the IRAT Measurement Configuration field element or its extended version is present.

For the New BSS to Old BSS Information elements, as defined in sub-clause 3.2.2.80, the length indicator (octet 2) is a binary number indicating the absolute length of the contents after the length indicator octet and may be set to zero. Field elements may occur in any order, and the receiver can ignore unknown field elements. Reception of erroneous New BSS to Old BSS Information does not cause rejection of the HANDOVER COMMAND or HANDOVER FAILURE messages; the information element is discarded, and the handover procedure continues. The DTM Handover Command Indication field element is included if the Layer 3 Information IE in a HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or HANDOVER COMMAND message contains a DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message.","The answer should cover the generic error handling rules applicable to all field elements as defined in Document 1, including the treatment of non-essential elements, spare bits, additional octets, missing elements, incorrect values, and reserved values. It should then detail the specific rules for Old BSS to New BSS Information elements from Document 2, including the length indicator, order of field elements, backward compatibility, precedence of information, handling of erroneous information, and conditions for D-RNTI and Source Cell ID field elements. Finally, it should describe the specific rules for New BSS to Old BSS Information elements from Document 3, including the length indicator, order of field elements, handling of erroneous information, and inclusion of DTM Handover Command Indication field element."
"What are the key test parameters and applicability rules for FeMBMS capable UEs, particularly focusing on the differences in CRS EPRE and MBSFN RS EPRE for various subcarrier spacings?","The key test parameters for FeMBMS capable UEs are defined in TS 36.101. For all Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) tests, the parameters specified in Table 10.1-1 are valid unless otherwise stated. One critical requirement is that the difference between Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS) Energy Per Resource Element (EPRE) and Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) Reference Signal (RS) EPRE should be set to 0 dB. This is important because the User Equipment (UE) demodulation performance might be affected if this condition is not met, especially in scenarios where power offsets are present, such as when reserved cells are involved.

For subcarrier spacings, the requirements vary:
- For a subcarrier spacing of 15kHz, the difference between CRS EPRE and MBSFN RS EPRE should be set to 0 dB.
- For a subcarrier spacing of 7.5kHz, the difference should be set to 3 dB.
- For a subcarrier spacing of 1.25kHz, the difference should be set to 10.8 dB.

Regarding the applicability rules for FeMBMS capable UEs, the requirements in clause 10.3 are applicable to UEs that support FeMBMS. The test case applicability is determined according to Table 10.1-2, depending on the set of supported UE capabilities. For FeMBMS capable UEs, if the corresponding tests listed in clause 10.1 or 10.3.1 or 10.3.2 are tested, the test coverage can be considered fulfilled without executing the corresponding tests listed in clause 10.3.3.","The answer should include the common test parameters for FDD tests, the requirement for CRS EPRE and MBSFN RS EPRE to be set to 0 dB for general cases, and the specific differences for various subcarrier spacings.

Describe the protocol error handling procedures for messages containing a Facility Information Element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.010.,"The protocol error handling procedures for messages containing a Facility Information Element (IE) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.010 involve several steps and checks to ensure proper processing and handling of errors. 

Initially, messages carrying a Facility IE must be checked for protocol errors. This involves two main checks:
1. The message itself is checked for protocol errors as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008. If any protocol errors are found, the procedures outlined in TS 24.008 are applied.
2. The contents of the Facility IE are checked for protocol errors as specified in subclause 2.2.8. If errors are found in the Facility IE content, the procedures in subclause 2.2.8 are followed.

If the initial checks pass without detecting any protocol errors, the receiver will attempt to process the contents of the Facility IE. During this processing, if errors occur (such as system failure or incompatibility with the requested operation), the procedures specified in the individual service specifications apply. Examples of behavior in such cases include:
- The network or mobile station (MS) may clear the call and reject the supplementary services request using a clearing message that contains a Return Error component in the Facility IE.
- The network and MS may continue processing the call according to normal call control procedures, rejecting the supplementary services request via a FACILITY message or another appropriate call control message containing a Return Error component.
- The network and MS may continue processing the call according to normal call control procedures, ignoring the supplementary services request.

Describe the procedure for emergency alert cancellation in both LMR and MC service systems as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.283.,"The procedure for emergency alert cancellation in both LMR and MC service systems as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.283 involves several pre-conditions and steps, with the Interworking Function (IWF) playing a crucial role in both processes.

For the LMR system:
Pre-conditions:
1. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including information that the MC service group is an interworking group.
2. The LMR user had previously successfully initiated an emergency alert via the IWF.
3. The MC service client 1 and MC service client 2 are affiliated to the MC service group.
4. The MC service server may have carried out an explicit or implicit affiliation procedure of the LMR user to the MC service group.
5. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.
6. The LMR user initiates an emergency alert cancel.

Steps:
1. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert cancel request to the MC service group to which it had previously sent the emergency alert request on behalf of the LMR user.
2. The MC service server sends the IWF emergency alert cancel response to the IWF to confirm the cancellation.
3. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request to the MC service clients of the affiliated MC service group members.
4. MC service users are notified of the emergency alert cancellation of the LMR user.
5. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the request. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.

Notes:
- The IWF performs identity conversion and protocol translation for all signaling messages between the MC service system and the LMR system.
- Steps 2 and 3 can be performed in whichever order.

For the MC service system:
Pre-conditions:
1. The MC service group information is available at the IWF, including information that the MC service group is an interworking group.
2. The MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MC service emergency alert request.
3. The MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.
4. The MC service client 2 is affiliated to the MC service group.
5. The MC service server may have carried out an explicit or implicit affiliation procedure of the LMR user with the MC service group.
6. The mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC service system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.

Steps:
1. The user at the MC service client 1 initiates an emergency alert cancel.
2. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service emergency alert cancel to the MC service group. The MC service server resolves the group ID, determines the affiliation status of the group members, and checks whether the IWF should be informed.
3. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response to MC service client 1 to confirm the cancellation, and MC service client 1 resets its emergency state.
4. The MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert cancel request(s) to the IWF. Depending on the affiliation status, either one or multiple requests are sent.
5. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert cancel response(s) to the MC service server to acknowledge the request(s).
6. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request towards the MC service clients of the affiliated MC service group members.
7. MC service users are notified of the emergency alert cancellation of MC service client 1.
8. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the request. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.

Notes:
- The IWF performs identity conversion and protocol translation for all signaling messages between the MC service system and the LMR system.
- Steps 3 and 4 can be performed in whichever order.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Detailed pre-conditions for both LMR and MC service systems.
  - Step-by-step procedure for emergency alert cancellation in both systems.

"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the EATF handles SIP INVITE, SIP BYE, and SIP re-INVITE requests in the context of E-SR-VCC.","The Evolved Access Transfer Function (EATF) handles SIP INVITE, SIP BYE, and SIP re-INVITE requests in the context of Emergency Session Access Transfer for Voice Call Continuity (E-SR-VCC) as follows:

1. **Handling SIP INVITE Requests Due to E-STN-SR**:
   - When the EATF receives a SIP INVITE request due to E-STN-SR, it identifies the transferable set of dialogs supporting a session with a speech media component anchored at the EATF. This identification is based on the `sip.instance` media feature tag provided by the SC UE in the Contact header field at session establishment, which must match the `sip.instance` media feature tag in the received SIP INVITE request.
   - If a confirmed dialog supporting a session with an active speech media component exists in the transferable set, the EATF associates the SIP INVITE request with this dialog and originates session modification by sending a SIP re-INVITE request with a new SDP offer. The EATF includes or modifies the Recv-Info header field as necessary.

2. **Handling SIP BYE Requests**:
   - If the EATF receives a SIP BYE request containing a Reason header field with the protocol value ","The answer should cover the following key details:
1. How the EATF distinguishes and handles SIP INVITE requests due to E-STN-SR, including the identification of transferable sets and session modification procedures.
2. The conditions under which the EATF processes SIP BYE requests with specific Reason and cause header field parameters, including the role of the operator specific timer and the steps taken if certain conditions are met.
3. The handling of SIP re-INVITE requests with specific Reason and cause header field parameters, including the steps taken if the SIP INVITE transaction is not yet completed and the procedures for sending SIP BYE requests and forwarding SIP responses."
"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the non-controlling MCVideo function of an MCVideo group handles a SIP BYE request, including the steps taken and the notifications sent to participants.","Upon receipt of a SIP BYE request, the non-controlling MCVideo function of an MCVideo group follows a series of steps to handle the request and notify participants. Firstly, if keeping the chat group call active aligns with the release policy, the non-controlling MCVideo function shall request the media plane to switch to controlling mode as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 24.581. This media plane processing is completed before proceeding to the next step. Secondly, the non-controlling MCVideo function shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP BYE request. Thirdly, if at least one MCVideo client has subscribed to the conference package, a NOTIFY request shall be sent to all participants with a subscription to the conference event package, indicating that all participants, except the MCVideo users belonging to the constituent MCVideo group hosted by the non-controlling MCVideo function, have left the group session.

The conditions under which the controlling MCVideo function releases the MCVideo session include scenarios such as the expiration of the T4 (Inactivity) timer, having only one or no participants in the session, the initiator of the group call leaving the session according to local policy, the absence of the minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members, or the expiration of the TNG3 (group call timer).

Conference event notifications are triggered by the receipt of a SIP BYE request from one of the participants in a pre-arranged or chat group session, or when a new participant is added to such a session. When sending a conference event notification, the non-controlling MCVideo function generates a notification package for all participants subscribed to the conference event package and sends a SIP NOTIFY request to these participants, as specified in TS 24.229. The notification can use content-indirection as defined in IETF RFC 4483 if the group document has large content.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The steps taken by the non-controlling MCVideo function upon receiving a SIP BYE request, including media plane switching, sending SIP 200 (OK) response, and sending NOTIFY requests.
  - The conditions under which the controlling MCVideo function releases the MCVideo session.
  - The triggers for sending conference event notifications and the procedures for generating and sending these notifications.
  - Reference to the media plane switching process as specified in TS 24.581 clause 6.3.5."
"What are the key policy and charging control requirements for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses as defined in TS 23.503, including session management and network slice related requirements?","The key policy and charging control requirements for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses as defined in TS 23.503 include several important aspects. Firstly, it is essential that policy and charging control can be applied to any kind of 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. This framework must also support the roaming scenarios that are defined. Policy and charging control can be enabled on a per slice instance, per Data Network Name (DNN), or both slice instance and DNN basis.

In a single Policy Control Function (PCF) deployment, the PCF is responsible for providing all mobility, User Equipment (UE) access selection, and PDU Session related policies. In deployments where different PCFs support N15 and N7 respectively, no standardized interface between them is required to support policy alignment in the current release.

The policy and charging control framework must fulfill non-session management related requirements, session management related requirements, and network slice related requirements. Specifically, for network slice related policy control, one of the key requirements is the limitation of the data rate per network slice.","The answer should include the applicability of policy and charging control to both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, support for roaming scenarios, and the basis for enabling policy and charging control (per slice instance, per DNN, or both). It should also cover the responsibilities of PCF in single and multiple PCF deployments, and the fulfillment of non-session management, session management, and network slice related requirements. Specifically, it should mention the limitation of the data rate per network slice as a key network slice related policy control requirement."
"Describe the procedure for informing the PCF about selected transfer policy when the 'PatchCorrection' feature is supported, including the steps involved, the data types used, and the possible responses from the PCF.","When the 'PatchCorrection' feature is supported, the procedure for informing the Policy Control Function (PCF) about the selected transfer policy involves several steps and specific data types. Initially, the Network Function (NF) service consumer retrieves the Background Data Transfer (BDT) policies or receives a BDT warning notification. Upon selecting a transfer policy, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP PATCH request to the PCF using the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service operation. The request URI is set to '{apiRoot}/npcf-bdtpolicycontrol/v1/bdtpolicies/{bdtPolicyId}'.

The HTTP PATCH request includes a 'PatchBdtPolicy' data type in the payload body, which contains the 'bdtPolData' attribute. This attribute encodes the transfer policy ID of the selected transfer policy in the 'selTransPolicyId' attribute. If no transfer policy is selected during re-negotiation, the 'selTransPolicyId' attribute is set to '0'.

The PCF may respond in several ways:
- If the request is successful, the PCF sends either a '204 No Content' response or a '200 OK' response with a 'BdtPolicy' data type in the payload body.
- If there is an internal error or an error in the HTTP PATCH request, the PCF sends an HTTP error response.
- If redirection is needed, the PCF sends an HTTP redirect response.

Additionally, the PCF may interact with the Unified Data Repository (UDR) to update or delete transfer policies. For initial transfer policy negotiation, the PCF may invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation to update the UDR with relevant data. For transfer policy re-negotiation, the PCF may either update the UDR with the selected candidate transfer policy using the PATCH method or remove the transfer policy using the DELETE method.

In summary, the procedure involves:
1. Retrieval of BDT policies or reception of BDT warning notification.
2. Sending an HTTP PATCH request with the 'PatchBdtPolicy' data type.
3. Handling responses from the PCF, including '204 No Content', '200 OK', error responses, and redirect responses.
4. Interaction with the UDR for updating or deleting transfer policies using PATCH, DELETE, and PUT methods.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The initial steps for informing the PCF about the selected transfer policy, including the retrieval of BDT policies and reception of BDT warning notification.
  - The invocation of the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service operation using an HTTP PATCH request.
  - The structure and content of the HTTP PATCH request, including the 'PatchBdtPolicy' data type and 'selTransPolicyId' attribute.
  - The possible responses from the PCF, including '204 No Content' and '200 OK' responses.
  - Handling of HTTP error responses and redirect responses.
  - Interaction with the UDR for updating or deleting transfer policies, including the relevant data structures and methods (PATCH, DELETE, PUT)."
"Describe the functionalities and interactions of the H-PCRF in the context of IP-CAN session establishment and termination, including the roles of S9 and Gx reference points.","The Home-Policy and Charging Rules Function (H-PCRF) is a critical component in both the Home Public Land Mobile Network (H-PLMN) and the Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN). It encompasses policy and charging control decision functionalities for both home routed access and visited access (local breakout).

When a Gateway Control Session is used and its establishment is indicated over the S9 reference point, the H-PCRF handles the session based on the following scenarios:
1. If one or more home routed IP-CAN sessions are known to the H-PCRF, these sessions can be bound to the Gateway Control session. In this case, the H-PCRF acts as described in the relevant procedures.
2. If no IP-CAN session is known to the H-PCRF, it indicates that the IP-CAN session establishment process has not yet been initiated over Gx or S9.

Upon receiving an IP-CAN Session Establishment over Gx, the H-PCRF concludes that the session is home routed and follows the procedures for home routed access. Conversely, if the establishment is received over S9, the H-PCRF concludes that the session uses visited access and follows the procedures for visited access.

The H-PCRF uses the S9 reference point to proxy information to the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF) via the Visited PCRF (V-PCRF) for various Gxx procedures, including Gateway Control Session establishment and termination, Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Provision, and Gateway Control and QoS Rule Requests. If an IP-CAN session termination is received over the Gx reference point, the H-PCRF initiates a Gateway Control Session Termination procedure over S9 if the session was established for a single IP-CAN session. Otherwise, it may initiate a procedure to remove the QoS Rules in the BBERF associated with the IP-CAN session.

For visited access, the H-PCRF uses the S9 reference point to proxy information to the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) and indirectly to the BBERF and Traffic Detection Function (TDF) via the V-PCRF for Gx procedures such as IP-CAN Session Establishment and Termination messages, Policy and Charging Rule Provisioning messages, and Request Policy and Charging Rules messages. When the Gateway Control Session is proxied to the H-PCRF, it uses the S9 reference point to proxy information to the BBERF via the V-PCRF for Gxx procedures, including Gateway Control Session Establishment and Termination messages, QoS Rules Provisioning messages, and Request QoS Rules messages.

Additionally, the H-PCRF generates Policy and Charging Control (PCC) rules for application traffic detection, notification, and policy control when the TDF is located in the VPLMN. It should generate PCC rules for both cases when the Application Function (AF) is located in the VPLMN and when the AF is located in the HPLMN, providing these rules to the V-PCRF over the S9 reference point.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of H-PCRF functionalities in both home routed access and visited access
  - Description of the role of S9 and Gx reference points in IP-CAN session establishment and termination
  - Detailed procedures for Gateway Control Session establishment and termination
  - Proxying of information to BBERF, PCEF, and TDF via V-PCRF
  - Generation and provision of PCC rules for application traffic detection, notification, and policy control"
"Describe the key requirements and functionalities of 3GPP TS 22.280 for Mission Critical Services, including how multiple services can be handled within a single group.","The creation of 3GPP TS 22.280 involved a thorough analysis by mission critical application stakeholders of all the requirements in related documents. Each requirement was evaluated to determine its applicability to various services such as MCPTT, MCVideo, or MCData. Requirements shared between two or more services were designated as Mission Critical Services Common Requirements (MCCoRe) and included in this technical specification. Normative annexes at the end of the specification enumerate each requirement applicable to specific services.

The term 'MCX Service' is used to refer to any mission critical service, and when applied in requirements, it means any service identified in the normative annexes. Except for inter-service interworking requirements, all requirements in the document are single service requirements. A mission critical group can use multiple services simultaneously, subject to permissions, service availability, and capable user equipment (UEs). During group communication, users can start or stop using any instantiation of MCX services.

The grouping and consolidation of common requirements are not intended to dictate architectural design but to provide flexibility for downstream working groups. They can create generic MCX Service functionality, extend/customize common services, or define separate support for specialized applications.

Specific requirements for inter-service interworking are detailed in sub-clause 8.4. It is essential to configure a single group to handle multiple MCX Services in a coordinated manner. The exact means of achieving this coordination is not specified, but the solution should appear as a combined service. For example, a user may affiliate to a single group for two services, either through a single affiliation indicating both services or by sending two affiliations in response to a single command. The goal is to ensure the solution looks and feels like a combined service.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The process of creating TS 22.280 and the evaluation of requirements from other documents.
  - The concept of MCCoRe and its significance.
  - Explanation of how a mission critical group can use multiple services and the implications for service requirements.
  - Specific requirements for inter-service interworking and how multiple services can be handled within a single group.
  - Configuration options for handling multiple MCX Services within a single group and the expected behavior of these configurations."
"Describe the roles and responsibilities of different entities (UE, AS, MRFP) in implementing MSRP as per 3GPP TS 24.247 specifications.","According to the 3GPP TS 24.247 specifications, different entities have specific roles and responsibilities in implementing the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP):

**MSRP Receiver Actions**:
When an MSRP receiver receives a SEND request, it must parse the request and respond with an appropriate status code. If the parsing is successful, a 200 (OK) status-code is sent, as specified in RFC 4975. If the parsing is unsuccessful, an appropriate status-code is sent, also as specified in RFC 4975.

What are the parameters for the various MBMS client APIs as defined in TS 26.347?,"The parameters for the various MBMS client APIs as defined in TS 26.347 are as follows:

1. **registerStreamingApp() API**:
   - **appId**: Provides a unique ID for the Media Application Agent (MAA) registering with the MBMS client. This ID is used to maintain state information for a particular MAA and is unique within the context of any MAA that may register with the MBMS client. Uniqueness is typically provided at the platform level.
   - **platformSpecificAppContext**: A platform-specific context for the registering MAA that enables the MBMS client to obtain extra information about the MAA. This information may be needed to enable MAA authentication or to facilitate communication between the MAA and the MBMS client via platform services (e.g., High-Level Operating System services).
   - **serviceClassList**: A comma-separated list of service classes that the MAA is interested in registering. Each service class string can be any string or may be empty.
   - **callBack**: Provides the MBMS client with callback functions associated with Media Streaming Application Service APIs for the registering MAA. Note that the callback element is optional and included only when the MAA development framework supports programmatic callback interfaces. If callbacks are not supported, the same information content defined in the callback structures is provided to the MAA via the notification method available with that development framework when the respective condition is met.

Describe the procedures and conditions for setting up a communication link and performing immunity tests on a UE as specified in TS 36.124.,"To set up a communication link and perform immunity tests on a User Equipment (UE) as specified in TS 36.124, the following procedures and conditions must be followed:

1. **Setting up a Communication Link:**
   - The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency is selected by setting the E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) to an appropriate number.
   - A communication link is established with a suitable base station simulator, referred to as 'the test system,' which should be located outside the test environment.

2. **Conditions for Traffic Mode:**
   - A call is set up according to the Generic call set-up procedure, with details provided in TS 36.508 and TS 36.509.
   - Positive TPC commands are continuously sent to the UE.
   - Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) is disabled.
   - Uplink power control is enabled.
   - The transmitting and/or receiving (UL/DL) bit rate for the reference test channel should match the reference measurement channel specified in Annex C of TS 36.101, with parameters detailed in Table 7.3.1-1 and Table 7.3.1-2 of TS 36.101.
   - Measures are taken to avoid the effect of unwanted signals on the measuring equipment.
   - For immunity testing, the wanted input signal level is set to 40 dB above the reference sensitivity level to ensure a stable communication link. The reference sensitivity level is defined in TS 36.101.
   - For emission testing, the wanted input signal level should be no more than 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level to prevent strong signal effects from limiting the performance of the measuring receiver.

3. **Conditions for Idle Mode:**
   - The UE should be camped on a cell.
   - The UE must perform Location Registration (LR) before the test but not during the test.
   - The UE's neighbour cell list should be empty.
   - The paging repetition period and DRX cycle should be set to the minimum (shortest possible time interval).

4. **Immunity Tests:**
   - Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the test at discrete frequencies, identified as narrow band responses (spurious responses), are handled by adjusting the unwanted signal frequency.
   - If the monitored quantity goes outside specified tolerances during an immunity test, the test is repeated with the unwanted signal frequency increased or decreased by BWChannel MHz, where BWChannel is the channel bandwidth defined in TS 36.101.
   - If the deviation persists, the frequency is further adjusted by 2 x BWChannel MHz.
   - If the deviation still does not disappear, the phenomenon is considered wide band (EMC) and the equipment fails the test. Narrow band responses are disregarded.
   - This procedure does not apply to conducted immunity tests in the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz.","The answer should include the steps for setting up a communication link, including the selection of EARFCN, the conditions for traffic mode (positive TPC commands, DTX disabled, uplink power control enabled, reference measurement channel parameters, unwanted signal effects mitigation, input signal levels for immunity and emission testing) and idle mode (cell camping, location registration, empty neighbour cell list, minimum paging repetition period and DRX cycle).

"Describe the media plane optimization procedures for WebRTC as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.334, including the role of DTLS and the relevant SDP attributes.","The media plane optimization procedures for WebRTC, as described in 3GPP TS 23.334, aim to convey media between WebRTC clients without bearer level protocol conversion. When both ends are WebRTC IMS clients (WIC), the eIMS-AGWs remain allocated but media plane interworking is disabled, except when lawful interception (LI) is needed. Depending on the configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG), the eIMS-AGW forwards all protocol layers either including DTLS or on top of DTLS transparently. Terminating the DTLS protocol layer for all calls can improve the transparency of LI. In Release 13, the procedure only supports transparent forwarding of all protocol layers including DTLS, and no related configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG) is required. However, in Release 14, the configuration in the eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG) must consider if the eIMS-AGW supports media plane optimization procedures with DTLS layer termination. The SDP attributes associated with WebRTC media plane optimization procedures include 'tra-contact', 'tra-m-line', 'tra-att', 'tra-SCTP-association', 'tra-media-line-number', and 'tra-bw', as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229, clause 7.5.4.","The answer should cover the purpose of media plane optimization procedures, the role of DTLS in these procedures, the configuration requirements in eP-CSCF (IMS-ALG) for Rel-13 and Rel-14, and the SDP attributes defined for WebRTC media plane optimization."
"Describe the process and conditions under which the UE interacts with the EPS NAS Security Context (EFEPSNSC) during various steps of the attach and detach procedures, including how the context is invalidated and updated.","The EPS NAS Security Context (EFEPSNSC) is a critical file that contains security-related information for the EPS NAS. The structure and contents of EFEPSNSC include several components, each tagged and coded as follows:

- Key Set Identifier (KSIASME) Tag '80': This is a 1-byte identifier for the ASME key set.
- ASME Key (KASME) Tag '81': This is a 32-byte key, with specific coding rules for its most and least significant bits.
- Uplink NAS count Tag '82': This is a 4-byte count, with coding rules for its most and least significant bits.
- Downlink NAS count Tag '83': This is a 4-byte count, with coding rules for its most and least significant bits.
- Identifiers of selected NAS integrity and encryption algorithms Tag '84': This is a 1-byte identifier, with unused bytes set to 'FF'.

The UE interacts with EFEPSNSC during various steps of the attach and detach procedures as follows:

1. After step a) of the attach procedure, the UE reads EFUST and EFEPSNSC.
2. During step b), the UE indicates in the AttachRequest that no key is available.
3. During step c), the UE sends the AuthenticationResponse message.
4. During step d), the UE sends the (NAS) SecurityModeComplete message.
5. EFEPSNSC is not updated during steps c) to e), unless for invalidating the content of EFEPSNSC.
6. After step f), the UE sends DETACH REQUEST to the E-USS/NB-SS.
7. After step f), EFEPSNSC contains:
   - Key Set Identifier KSIASME: '00'
   - ASME Key (KSIASME): 32-byte key, value not checked
   - Uplink NAS count: any value
   - Downlink NAS count: any value
   - Identifiers of selected NAS integrity and encryption algorithm: any value

The conditions for invalidating EFEPSNSC are described in TS 31.102, clause 4.2.92. The context can be marked as invalid by setting the record bytes to 'FF', setting KSIASME to '07', or setting the length indicated in the ASME key TLV to '00'.

Additionally, during the attach procedure:
- After step a) and before step d), the UE either keeps the content of EFEPSNSC as specified in the initial conditions or invalidates it.
- During steps d), e), f), g), h), i), and j), the UE shall not update EFEPSNSC.

In summary, the UE reads, updates, and invalidates EFEPSNSC at specific steps during the attach and detach procedures, with strict conditions for invalidation and prohibitions on updating the context during certain steps.","The answer must include a detailed description of the EPS NAS Security Context (EFEPSNSC) structure and contents, including the tags and coding for each component.

Additionally, subclause 6.5 describes the mechanism to ensure compatibility of the binary format when introducing extensions for new features or services. Specifically, subclause 6.5.1 outlines that an Application Server (AS) supporting new features or services may generate transparent data by allocating reserved fields in a dataset or defining new datasets. This transparent data can be accessed by another AS that does not support the extensions, which may lead to interoperability issues. Therefore, careful consideration and mechanisms are required to manage these potential issues and ensure seamless compatibility across different AS implementations.","The answer should cover the support for MMTEL services in binary format, including the matching of PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services and the relevant information elements. It should also explain the mechanism for compatibility when introducing extensions to the binary format, including the generation of transparent data and potential interoperability issues."
"Describe the affiliation and de-affiliation process for MC service groups as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280, and explain how these processes are applied to MCVideo and MCPTT services according to their respective 3GPP documents.","The affiliation and de-affiliation process for MC service groups as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 involves two primary methods: explicit and implicit affiliation. Explicit affiliation occurs when an MC service client indicates interest in one or more MC service groups to the MC service server, either initiated by the MC service user or automatically by the MC service client. Implicit affiliation is determined through configurations and policies within the MC service and performed by the associated MC service server. 

An MC service user must be a member of an MC service group before becoming an affiliated member. The MC service server may refuse a request for affiliation, preventing the user from participating in the requested MC service. De-affiliation indicates that the user is no longer interested in the MC service group and cannot perform actions associated with an affiliated member. This can occur explicitly by the user's request or implicitly by the server due to actions like logging off. When a user logs off, all affiliations are revoked even if no explicit de-affiliation signaling is sent. Upon successful service authorization, re-affiliation occurs automatically for groups configured for implicit affiliation.

For MCVideo services, as specified in TS 23.281, MCVideo users affiliated to MCVideo groups receive notifications for group call setup and invitations. They can select an affiliated group to initiate new group calls or transmit media in existing calls, and they receive media and events from their affiliated groups.

"Describe the procedures for group creation, group-based C2 QoS provisioning, and group update in UAV communication as specified in 3GPP TS 23.255, and explain the resource request process at VAL service communication establishment as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434.","The procedures for group creation, group-based C2 QoS provisioning, and group update in UAV communication as specified in 3GPP TS 23.255 are as follows:

1. **Group Creation**:
   - **Pre-conditions**: Both UAV-C and UAV must have successfully registered and connected to the UAE server, and a CAA-level UAV ID must be assigned to both.
   - **Steps**:
     1. The UAE server recognizes a unique pair of UAV and UAV-C either by 3GPP UE ID or CAA-level UAV ID.
     2. The UAE server sends a group creation request to the SEAL GM server if there is no pre-assigned group ID, using the GM-S reference link as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434. The SEAL GM server creates one group ID for the pair.
     3. The UAE server uses the returned group ID for UAS for QoS management.

2. **Group-based C2 QoS Provisioning**:
   - **Pre-conditions**: Both UAV and UAV-C must be registered to the 3GPP 5G network, and the group ID for the UAS group must be available at the UAE server.
   - **Steps**:
     1. The UAE server monitors the QoS for the UAS group by SEAL NRM as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434.
     2. If the network condition for C2 communication does not meet the pre-defined QoS requirement, the UAE server may send a QoS adaptation request to the SEAL NRM server using the NRM-S reference point. The request is sent per group ID for the pair created in the group creation procedure.
     3. The subsequent network resource adaptation procedure is triggered by the UAE server.
     4. The UAE client and UAE server establish communication based on new QoS requirements.
     5. The UAS application layer adapts the updated QoS assignment.

3. **Group Update**:
   - **Pre-conditions**: UAV-C, UAV-1, and UAV-2 must be subscribed with the 3GPP Core Network and UAS application-specific server, and have received a 3GPP UE ID and a CAA-level UAV ID. UAV-1 and UAV-C must be grouped by a group ID.
   - **Steps**:
     1. The UAE server recognizes a new pair of UAV-2 and UAV-C by the new CAA-level UAV ID.
     2. The UAE server sends a group membership update request to the SEAL GM server. The SEAL GM server sends a group membership update response.

The resource request process at VAL service communication establishment as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 involves the following steps:

- **Pre-condition**: The VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.
- **Steps**:
  1. The VAL server sends a request for resources to the NRM server.
  2. The NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and resource sharing.

"Explain the S-NAPTR procedure for discovering and selecting an AMF serving a particular UE usage type during an EPS to 5GS handover using the N26 interface. Include details on the application-unique string, service parameters, and the candidate list generation.","The S-NAPTR procedure is employed to discover and select an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) serving a particular User Equipment (UE) usage type during an Evolved Packet System (EPS) to 5G System (5GS) handover using the N26 interface. This procedure uses the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) specified in the relevant technical specifications, such as the 5GS TAI-FQDN for AMF selection.

The application-unique string in this context is set to the FQDN, and the enhanced service parameters are appended with the character string '+ue-<ue usage type>' to the 'app-protocol' name. For example, the procedure for a Mobility Management Entity (MME) to find a candidate set of target AMFs with the N26 interface uses the service parameters 'x-3gpp-amf:x-n26+ue-<ue usage type>'.

Operators must provision corresponding DNS NAPTR records for these FQDNs, including the enhanced service parameters that identify the UE usage type(s) for which the record applies. The S-NAPTR procedure logically outputs a candidate list of AMFs serving at least the requested UE usage type. If no candidate AMF is found for the requested UE usage type, the procedure may be performed without the '+ue-<ue usage type>' suffix, unless operator policies dictate otherwise.

The general principles of the S-NAPTR procedure involve consistent provisioning of DNS NAPTR records as described in IETF RFC 3958. This includes provisioning NAPTR records with appropriate flags and service fields, and potentially using SRV records for load balancing or non-standard ports. The procedure outputs a list of host names, each with a service, protocol, port, and a list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, referred to as a candidate list.

Standardized service parameters names are defined to identify services, such as 'x-3gpp-amf:x-n26' for the AMF N26 interface service. These names follow the experimental format specified in IETF RFC 3958 and are used in the procedures defined in the relevant technical specifications.

In summary, the S-NAPTR procedure for AMF selection during EPS to 5GS handover using the N26 interface involves using an application-unique string set to the FQDN, enhanced service parameters to identify the UE usage type, provisioning DNS NAPTR records, and generating a candidate list of AMFs. This ensures the selection of an appropriate AMF to support the specific UE usage type during the handover process.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The purpose of the S-NAPTR procedure in the context of EPS to 5GS handover using the N26 interface.
- The application-unique string format, specifically the FQDN and the enhanced service parameters with the '+ue-<ue usage type>' suffix.
- The provisioning of DNS NAPTR records and the role of service parameters in identifying the UE usage type.
- The generation of the candidate list of AMFs, including the logical output and handling cases where no candidate AMF is found.
- Examples of standardized service parameters names and their usage in the procedure."
"What are the requirements for UE to detect and measure intra-frequency RSTD as specified in 3GPP TS 37.571, and what are the key parameters involved in this process?","The requirements for UE to detect and measure intra-frequency RSTD as specified in 3GPP TS 37.571 include the ability to detect and measure RSTD for at least 16 cells, including the reference cell, on the same carrier frequency within a specified time. The key parameters involved in this process are:

- **TMIB**: The time required for acquiring the MIB information of the target cell. TMIB is zero if the SFN of at least one cell in OTDOA assistance data is known to the UE.
- **Measurement Gap Repetition Period (MGRP)**: Defined in TS 36.133, it is the period for UE configured with measurement gaps for intra-frequency RSTD measurements.
- **PRS Positioning Occasions**: The number of PRS positioning occasions within which the UE must measure the cells.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Requirements**: The UE must report RSTD for the reference cell with a SNR of -6 dB and for neighbor cells with a SNR of -13 dB.
- **Measurement Time**: The total time for detecting and measuring at least 16 cells, including the reference cell, within the specified measurement time.

The normative references for these requirements are TS 36.133 clause 8.13.2.3.1 and A.8.12.3. Additionally, the process involves specific conditions and configurations for UE, such as measurement gaps and PRS subframes. The RSTD reporting time requirement in an FDD system is illustrated in Figure 9.3.1.1.3-1 of TS 37.571, which assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other LPP signaling on the DCCH.","The answer should cover the following key details:

How is the NAS protection algorithm selected and communicated during an AMF change in N2-Handover or mobility registration update according to 3GPP specifications?,"The NAS protection algorithm selection during an AMF change in N2-Handover or mobility registration update is governed by specific 3GPP specifications. When an AMF change occurs, either due to N2-Handover or mobility registration update, the target AMF must select the NAS algorithm with the highest priority from the ordered lists. This selection process is detailed in TS 33.501, clause 6.7.1.2.

During an N2-Handover, the target AMF communicates the selected NAS algorithm to the UE using the NAS Container, as defined in clause 6.9.2.3.3. For mobility registration updates, the selected algorithm is communicated using the NAS Security Mode Command (SMC), as specified in clause 6.9.3.

To verify the correct selection of NAS protection algorithms, test cases are conducted. In the N2-Handover test case, the AMF under test receives the UE security capabilities and the NAS algorithms used by the source AMF. It then selects the NAS algorithms with the highest priority according to the ordered lists, ensuring they differ from those received from the source AMF. The tester captures the NAS Container of the NGAP HANDOVER REQUEST message sent by the AMF under test to the gNB, which includes the chosen algorithm.

Similarly, in the mobility registration update test case, the AMF under test selects the NAS algorithms with the highest priority from the ordered lists, differing from those received from the source AMF. The AMF then initiates a NAS security mode command procedure and includes the chosen algorithms.

The expected results for these test cases include evidence suitable for the interface, such as screenshots containing the operational results, ensuring that the NAS protection algorithms are selected and communicated correctly during AMF changes.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The conditions under which the NAS protection algorithm needs to be selected during AMF change (N2-Handover or mobility registration update).
  - The process of selecting the NAS algorithm with the highest priority according to ordered lists.

"Describe the process of tunnel data transfer in the bearer independent CS core network, including the roles of the (G)MSC server and MGW, and the additional requirements for tunnelling transport mechanism.","The process of tunnel data transfer in the bearer independent CS core network involves several steps and the interaction between the (G)MSC server and the Media Gateway (MGW). Initially, the (G)MSC server waits for the MGW to use the Tunnel Information Up procedure to supply the tunnel data. Once the tunnel data is received, the (G)MSC server sends this data to the succeeding node in the Initial Address Message (IAM). Subsequently, when the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the succeeding node, it uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure to supply the MGW with the received tunnel data.

Additionally, the (G)MSC server sends the tunnel data received in the IAM to the MGW using the Tunnel Information Down procedure. When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server forwards the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the preceding node.

Furthermore, there are additional requirements for the tunnelling transport mechanism within the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it must be performed in accordance with the guidelines specified in 3GPP TS 23.153.","The answer should cover the sequence of tunnel data transfer involving the IAM and Tunnel Information messages, the roles of the (G)MSC server and MGW in using Tunnel Information Up and Down procedures, and the additional requirements for tunnelling transport mechanism within the bearer independent CS core network.

Explain the role and handling of criticality information in S1AP messages as defined in 3GPP TS 36.413.,"The role of criticality information in S1AP messages, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.413, is to instruct the receiving node on how to handle Information Elements (IEs) or IE groups that are not comprehended or are missing. This ensures proper message handling and error reporting in S1AP procedures.

Criticality information can have three possible values:
1. Reject IE: If an IE or IE group with this criticality is missing, the receiving node must reject the entire procedure and report the missing elements. If the message initiating the procedure lacks sufficient information to report the unsuccessful outcome, the procedure is terminated, and an Error Indication procedure is initiated.
2. Ignore IE and Notify Sender: If an IE or IE group with this criticality is missing, the receiving node continues with the procedure based on the other present IEs/IE groups and reports the missing elements in the response message. If the initiating message lacks sufficient information, the procedure is terminated, and an Error Indication procedure is initiated.
3. Ignore IE: If an IE or IE group with this criticality is missing, the receiving node simply ignores the missing elements and continues with the procedure based on the other present IEs/IE groups.

The criticality information is defined in subclause 10.3.2, with detailed actions for each criticality value specified in subclause 10.3.5. Subclause 10.3.4 provides additional details on handling criticality information.

"Describe the requirements for occupied bandwidth in E-UTRA and NB-IoT as per 3GPP specifications, including the definitions and configurations for channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth.","The requirements for occupied bandwidth in E-UTRA and NB-IoT are specified in various 3GPP documents. For E-UTRA, the OTA occupied bandwidth for each carrier must be less than the channel bandwidth. In the case of contiguous carrier aggregation (CA), the occupied bandwidth must be less than or equal to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth. This is outlined in TS 37.145 clause 6.7.2.5.3. If the test requirement differs from the minimum requirement, a non-zero test tolerance is applied, as defined in TS 37.145 clause 4.1.2, with further explanation provided in annex C.

The definitions and configurations for channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth in E-UTRA are detailed in TS 36.141 clause 5.6. The channel bandwidth (BWChannel) is defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the carrier separated by the channel bandwidth, i.e., at FC +/- BWChannel /2. The Aggregated Channel Bandwidth for intra-band carrier aggregation is defined as BWChannel_CA = Fedge_high - Fedge_low, where Fedge_low and Fedge_high are calculated using the center frequencies and offsets. For non-contiguous spectrum, the sub-block bandwidth (BWChannel,block) is similarly defined using sub-block edges and offsets.

For NB-IoT, the requirements are specified for different operational modes: standalone, in-band, and guard band. Each mode has specific definitions and transmission bandwidth configurations. For standalone operation, the channel bandwidth (BWChannel) and transmission bandwidth configuration (NRB, Ntone 15kHz, and Ntone 3.75kHz) are defined with the channel edges at FC +/- BWChannel /2. Similar definitions apply for in-band and guard band operations, with specific figures illustrating the relationships and configurations.

2. **Acknowledgment**: If the Target BSS supports the LCLS feature, it includes the LCLS-BSS-Status IE in the Handover Request Acknowledge message to inform the Target MSC Server of its support. The Target MSC Server then sends the same information in the MAP Prepare Handover Response message to the MSC-1 Server.

3. **Bearer Establishment towards Target BSS**: The Target MSC Server requests the Target MGW to seize a TDM circuit using the Reserve Circuit procedure or an IP termination using the reserve Connection Point procedure. The Handover Request message sent to the Target BSS contains the CIC for AoTDM or the IP addresses and UDP ports received from the Target MGW if AoIP.

4. **Bearer Establishment between MGW-1 and Target MGW**: The handling of bearer establishment between MGW-1 and Target MGW follows the procedure described for basic mobile terminating calls.

5. **Completion**: When LCLS is established during the handover procedure, the Target BSS informs the Target MSC-Server that the call has been locally switched in the Handover Complete message. Additionally, the Target BSS sends an LCLS-Notification message to the MSC at the other call leg indicating the call is locally switched.

In scenarios where LCLS was not established before the Inter-MSC handover, the call remains not local, and LCLS cannot be established. The handover procedure is completed as for a non-local call, and the LCLS status in the core network is not changed.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The role of the Target MSC server in selecting the Target MGW and sending the Handover Request message.
- The inclusion of specific IEs (GCR IE, LCLS-Configuration IE, LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE) in the Handover Request message.
- The acknowledgment process by the Target BSS and the inclusion of the LCLS-BSS-Status IE.
- The procedures for bearer establishment towards the Target BSS and between MGW-1 and Target MGW.
- The completion of the handover and the notification of LCLS establishment.
- The handling of scenarios where LCLS is not established before the Inter-MSC handover."
"What are the requirements for including an 'ETag' (entity-tag) header in HTTP responses according to TS 29.510, and are there any exceptions?","According to TS 29.510, an 'ETag' (entity-tag) header should be included in HTTP responses as described in IETF RFC 7232 clause 2.3. This header must contain a server-generated strong validator, which allows for the matching of this value (included in subsequent client requests) with a given resource representation stored in the server or in a cache. Specifically, for resource creation and resource update operations, the inclusion of an 'ETag' header is required. However, there is an exception for Heart-Beat operations, where an 'ETag' header should not be included in the HTTP responses.","The answer should cover the general requirement for including an 'ETag' header in HTTP responses as described in IETF RFC 7232 clause 2.3, specifying that it should contain a server-generated strong validator. It should also mention the specific case for resource creation and update, and the exception for Heart-Beat operation as outlined in Document 1."
Explain the handling of criticality information in RANAP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 25.413.,"In RANAP messages, criticality information plays a crucial role in instructing the receiver on how to handle Information Elements (IEs) or IE groups that are not comprehended. The criticality information is defined in subclause 10.3.2 and specifies actions based on three possible values: Reject IE, Ignore IE and Notify Sender, and Ignore IE.

1. **Reject IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE', the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information received is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the procedure is terminated, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

2. **Ignore IE and Notify Sender**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs present. The missing IEs are reported in the response message, or if insufficient information is received, the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages, the procedure continues, and the missing IEs are reported via the Error Indication procedure.

3. **Ignore IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs present. The same applies to response messages.

The rules for considering an IE, IE group, or EP as not comprehended are as follows:
- When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity.
- The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any unsupported EP may be considered not comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.

Reporting requirements for missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality values include the inclusion of the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. Additional elements such as the Repetition Number IE and the Message Structure IE (if the missing IE/IE group is not at the top level) are also required.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of criticality information in RANAP messages.
- The three possible values of criticality information and their respective actions: Reject IE, Ignore IE and Notify Sender, Ignore IE.
- The rules for considering an IE, IE group, or EP as not comprehended.
- Specific actions to be taken by the receiving node when an IE/IE group is missing, based on its criticality value.
- The reporting requirements for missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality values."
"Explain the handling of criticality information in NBAP messages, including the actions taken by the receiving node based on different criticality values and the procedures for missing IEs/IE groups.","In NBAP messages, criticality information is used to instruct the receiving node on how to handle Information Elements (IEs) or IE groups that are not comprehended or are missing. The criticality information can have three possible values: 'Reject IE', 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', and 'Ignore IE'. 

When the criticality information is set to 'Reject IE', if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with this specified criticality, the receiving node will reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information received is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the receiving node will terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure. Similarly, if a response message is missing IEs/IE groups with 'Reject IE' criticality, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

For 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', if a received message initiating a procedure is missing IEs/IE groups with this criticality, the receiving node will ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs present. The node will report the missing IEs in the response message or initiate the Error Indication procedure if necessary. The same approach is taken for response messages missing IEs with 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender' criticality.

When the criticality information is 'Ignore IE', the receiving node will simply ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs present in both initiating and response messages.

The rules for comprehension state that if one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version are considered comprehended by the receiving entity, although some may remain unsupported. However, comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated, and unsupported EPs may be considered not comprehended, with actions based on criticality applied accordingly.

In summary, the handling of criticality information in NBAP messages ensures that the receiving node can appropriately manage IEs or IE groups that are not comprehended or are missing, based on the specified criticality values, thereby maintaining the integrity and functionality of the communication procedures.","The answer should include:
- An overview of criticality information in NBAP messages and its purpose.
- The three possible values of criticality information ('Reject IE', 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', 'Ignore IE') and the actions associated with each.

Describe the key elements involved in the activation of Intercept Related Information (IRI) as per 3GPP TS 33.107 section 5.1.2.,"The activation of Intercept Related Information (IRI) involves several key elements as outlined in 3GPP TS 33.107 section 5.1.2. These elements include the target identity, which specifies the individual or entity being intercepted. The message also contains the address(es) for delivery of IRI, which is the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) address. Optionally, multiple addresses can be provided for distributed delivery of IRI to a single LEMF, and primary and failover addresses can be specified for delivery to either a single LEMF or two different LEMFs for the same Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID). The subset of information to be delivered is also defined, along with an indication of whether the LALS Enhanced Location for IRI should be delivered. This indication is used to arm the LALS Triggering Function when it is associated with the Delivery Function (DF). Additionally, a DF2 activation identity is included, which uniquely identifies the activation for DF2 and is used for further interrogation or deactivation. The message may also contain the Interception Authorization (IA) in case of location-dependent interception, the status of interception of international outbound roaming IMS VoIP (allowed or not allowed), and the warrant reference number if required by national regulations. When a target is intercepted for several Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and/or several identities simultaneously, a single activation of delivery is necessary for each combination of LEA and identity.","The answer must include the target identity, the address(es) for delivery of IRI, the subset of information to be delivered, the indication for LALS Enhanced Location, the DF2 activation identity, the IA for location dependent interception, the status of international outbound roaming IMS VoIP interception, and the warrant reference number if required. Additionally, it should mention the necessity of a single activation for each combination of LEA and identity when multiple LEAs or identities are involved."

1. Only the basic error correction protocol is required, making other error correction protocols unnecessary.
2. For the initial alignment procedure, both the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and the VLR (Visitor Location Register) may apply either the emergency proving period or the normal proving period. If all signalling links between the two entities are unavailable, the emergency proving period must be applied until at least one signalling link becomes available.
3. The processor outage status indicator must be recognized at both the SGSN and the VLR. The procedures defined in clause 8 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.703 and ANSI T1.111.3 must be supported.

Describe the different configurations and functionalities of IMS transit network support as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.228.,"IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) provides services to end user customers of a network operator by directly supporting multimedia communications services. However, IMS can also be used in various configurations to support CS (Circuit Switched) domain customers or interconnect other networks. There are three general cases in which IMS may be used for transit network support:

1. **IMS operator providing transit functionality for its own, non-IMS (CS domain), customers**: In this scenario, the operator serves its own customers, some of whom have migrated to IMS while others remain CS domain subscribers. SIP traffic arrives at a configured entry point, and PSTN traffic arrives at the operator's MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function). If the destination user is not an IMS subscriber, the operator routes the session to the CS domain.

2. **IMS operator providing transit functionality to enterprise networks**: Here, the operator acts as a transit network for an enterprise IP network, providing connectivity to both PSTN and IP endpoints. Traffic from the enterprise network arrives at a provisioned routing entity and is routed to either an IP network or the PSTN, depending on the terminating endpoint.

3. **IMS operator providing transit functionality to other network operators**: In this case, the operator serves as an IMS session-based routing backbone for a PSTN operator or another IP network, providing connectivity to both PSTN and IP endpoints. Traffic from the PSTN operator arrives at configured MGCFs for translation to SIP, while IMS traffic arrives at a configured entry point. The operator routes the traffic to either an IP network or the PSTN, depending on the terminating endpoint.

Additionally, IMS can provide application services in transit network scenarios. These services can be classified as:

- **Originating IMS application services**: IMS application services are provided for SIP traffic received from the served network operator or enterprise network. The appropriate application services are invoked based on the received SIP traffic before routing it towards the destination endpoint.

- **Terminating IMS application services**: IMS application services are provided for SIP traffic destined to a served network operator or enterprise network. The appropriate application services are invoked when the served network is identified as the next network or when the traffic is identified as destined to the served network.

Transit service invocation is performed based on locally configured criteria specific to the transit scenario, taking into account the preceding and succeeding networks and other session information. The service invocation procedure supports suppression of conflicting services, multiple invocations of the same service, and loopback scenarios.","The answer should cover the general overview of IMS functionalities, the three specific cases of IMS transit network support, and the types of IMS application services provided in transit scenarios. It should include details on traffic routing, session analysis, transit invocation criteria, and service invocation procedures."
"Explain the process and considerations for providing IMS services to a UE accessing an SNPN, including the role of IMS user identities, home network domain names, and the determination of whether the user belongs to a PLMN or an SNPN.","The process of providing IMS services to a UE accessing an SNPN involves several key considerations and steps. Firstly, different strategies can be adopted to support multiple SNPNs. The IMS network operator can either use common IMS Network Function (NF) instances, such as P-CSCF or HSS, for all IMS users or deploy separate IMS NF instances for each SNPN. The identification of the corresponding SNPN is based on the home network domain and IMPI/IMPU identifiers generated and provided by the UE during the IMS registration procedure.

When the IMS network owner is different from the SNPN, such as a PLMN operator, interconnectivity via N6, N5, and NU1 reference points requires additional security measures over these interfaces. It is assumed that no NAT is present between the UPF and the P-CSCF, or that it is kept transparent to the UE to avoid issues with IP address mismatches in the SIP header.

The relationship between IMPI, IMPU, home network domain, and SUPI in SNPN 5GC is crucial. If the SUPI contains an IMSI, the IMPI and IMPU are derived from the IMSI, including the PLMN ID and NID corresponding to the SNPN. If the SUPI is in NAI format, the realm part of the NAI can be used to build the realm of the IMPI, the domain of the IMPU, and the home network domain name identifying the SNPN serving the UE.

Existing IMS and 5GS procedures and reference points can be used to provide IMS services to a UE accessing an SNPN. The determination of whether the user belongs to a PLMN or an SNPN is based on the home network domain provided by the UE during the IMS registration procedure and IMS user identities. The P-CSCF determines the SNPN the UE belongs to based on the home network domain name in the Request-URI of the SIP REGISTER sent to the P-CSCF. Additionally, the P-CSCF may request the PCF at the SNPN associated with the home network domain name to report the PLMN ID + NID where the UE is claiming to be registered. The HSS determines the SNPN the UE belongs to based on the visited network identifier provided by the I-CSCF during the authorization of the IMS registration.

For subsequent IMS requests related to the SNPN UE, the IMS NF instances can identify the SNPN based on the information received during the IMS registration procedure and IMS user identities, which can be applied to charging and collection of statistics data.","The answer should cover the following key points: 1. Different strategies for supporting multiple SNPNs, including the use of common or separate IMS NF instances. 2. The process of identifying the corresponding SNPN based on home network domain and IMPI/IMPU identifiers during IMS registration. 3. Security considerations for interconnectivity when the IMS network owner is different from the SNPN. 4. The relationship between IMPI, IMPU, home network domain, and SUPI in SNPN 5GC. 5. The use of existing IMS and 5GS procedures and reference points for providing IMS services to SNPN. 6. How the P-CSCF and HSS determine whether the user belongs to a PLMN or an SNPN based on home network domain and visited network identifier during IMS registration."
What are the key differences between DCI format 2_1 and DCI format 2_4 as specified in 3GPP TS 38.212?,"DCI format 2_1 and DCI format 2_4 serve different purposes in the 3GPP TS 38.212 specification. DCI format 2_1 is used to notify the Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols where the User Equipment (UE) may assume no transmission is intended for it. This format includes pre-emption indications, with each indication being 14 bits, and the overall size of the DCI format 2_1 is configurable by higher layers up to 126 bits. The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for DCI format 2_1 is scrambled by the Interrupt-RNTI (INT-RNTI).

On the other hand, DCI format 2_4 is used to notify the PRBs and OFDM symbols where the UE cancels the corresponding uplink (UL) transmission. This format includes cancellation indications, with the number of bits for each indication being configurable by higher layer parameters. The overall size of DCI format 2_4 is also configurable by higher layers up to 126 bits, specifically through the parameter dci-PayloadSizeForCI. For a UE, there is at most one cancellation indication for an UL carrier. The CRC for DCI format 2_4 is scrambled by the Cancellation-RNTI (CI-RNTI).

In summary, DCI format 2_1 is focused on pre-emption indications with a fixed bit size per indication, while DCI format 2_4 deals with cancellation indications with a configurable bit size per indication. Both formats have a configurable overall size up to 126 bits and use different RNTIs for CRC scrambling.","The answer should cover the purpose of each DCI format (2_1 for pre-emption indication and 2_4 for cancellation indication), the type of information transmitted (pre-emption indications vs. cancellation indications), the CRC scrambling (INT-RNTI for 2_1 and CI-RNTI for 2_4), and the configurable size and bit details for each format."
Describe the key technical specifications and requirements for frequency stability and repeater error vector magnitude (EVM) as outlined in 3GPP TS 38.115.,"The key technical specifications and requirements for frequency stability and repeater error vector magnitude (EVM) as outlined in 3GPP TS 38.115 are as follows:

1. **Frequency Stability**: The test purpose is to verify that frequency stability is within the limit specified by the minimum requirement. This ensures that the frequency remains stable and does not deviate beyond the acceptable range during operation.

2. **Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)**: The Repeater EVM is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and the measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is called the error vector. The calculation of repeater EVM involves several steps:
   - Correcting the measured waveform by sample timing offset and RF frequency offset.
   - Removing carrier leakage from the measured waveform.
   - Equalizing the measured waveform using channel estimates subjected to the repeater EVM equalizer spectrum flatness requirement.
   
   The EVM result is defined differently for different waveform types:
   - For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage.
   - For CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage.

   The basic repeater EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time domain, which is reduced by any symbols that contain an allowable power transient in the measurement interval. The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is operating with an input power level within the range required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (Prated,p,EIRP) to the minimum input power levels specified in the relevant table.

These specifications ensure that the repeater maintains high modulation quality and operates effectively within the defined power range.","The answer should include the purpose of verifying frequency stability within specified limits, the detailed methodology for calculating repeater EVM including corrections and equalizations, the definition of EVM results for different waveform types, the measurement interval, and the applicable input power range for the repeater EVM requirement."
Describe the role and behavior of the IPFlow node and its interior nodes in the context of flow distribution rules for non-seamless offload as specified in TS 24.312.,"The IPFlow node plays a crucial role in defining the flow description for a particular flow distribution rule in the context of non-seamless offload. According to TS 24.312, the IPFlow node occurs once, is formatted as a node, and can be accessed using Get or Replace methods. An empty IPFlow node indicates a match-all flow description, meaning it will match any traffic. If a flow distribution rule contains multiple instances of the IPFlow node, the User Equipment (UE) will consider the rule valid if at least one of the flow descriptions matches the traffic, as described in subclause 5.7.37.

The interior nodes within the IPFlow node act as placeholders for one or more flow descriptions. These interior nodes can occur one or more times, are formatted as nodes, and can also be accessed using Get or Replace methods. If a flow description is defined with multiple interior nodes or leaf values (such as App-ID, AddressType, etc.) within a single instance of the IPFlow node, the UE will consider the flow description matching the traffic only if all the present interior nodes and leaf values match the traffic. This ensures that the flow description is precise and matches the specified criteria for traffic management.","The answer should explain the function of the IPFlow node in defining flow descriptions for flow distribution rules. It should detail the occurrence, format, and access types of the IPFlow node, and clarify the behavior when the node is empty or when multiple instances are present. Additionally, the answer should describe the role of interior nodes within the IPFlow node, their occurrence, format, and access types, and the conditions under which the UE considers the flow description matching the traffic."
"Describe the command syntax and functionality of the +CVAEACT and +CSQ commands as defined in 3GPP TS 27.007, including their parameters, possible error values, and implementation details.","The +CVAEACT command in 3GPP TS 27.007 is used to activate or deactivate the VAE layer support in a mobile terminal (MT). When activated, the MT performs the V2X service discovery procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.486 clause 6.6. The command syntax includes parameters such as <state>, <V2X_UE_id>, <result>, and <service_discovery_data>. The <state> parameter specifies whether the VAE layer support is enabled (0) or disabled (1). The <V2X_UE_id> parameter indicates the V2X UE identity used for enabling the VAE layer support, while the <result> parameter shows the result of enabling the VAE layer. The <service_discovery_data> parameter provides information about the service discovery data when the VAE layer support is successfully enabled.

The MT announces its network registration status using unsolicited result codes +CEREG and +C5GREG. If the MT is not registered or is searching for an operator, the TE deactivates the VAE layer support. If the MT is registered or attached to 5GS, the TE deactivates the VAE layer support if it is activated. If the V2X service discovery procedure fails, a +CME ERROR is returned, with possible error values referenced in clause 9.2. The read command returns the current activation states for all defined PDP contexts and the current VAE layer configuration information.

The +CSQ command returns the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel bit error rate (BER) from the MT. The execution command provides the RSSI and BER values, while the test command returns the supported values as compound values. The <rssi> parameter ranges from 0 to 31, indicating signal strength from -113 dBm or less to -51 dBm or greater, with 99 indicating unknown or undetectable values. The <ber> parameter ranges from 0 to 7, corresponding to RXQUAL values in 3GPP TS 45.008 clause 8.2.4, with 99 indicating unknown or undetectable values.

Both commands are optional and their implementation depends on the support for EPS in the MT. Possible error values for these commands are detailed in clause 9.2 of TS 27.007.","The answer must include a detailed description of the +CVAEACT command syntax, its parameters, and functionality, including activation and deactivation of VAE layer support, handling of network registration status, V2X service discovery procedure, and error handling. It should also cover the +CSQ command syntax, its parameters, and functionality, including received signal strength indication and channel bit error rate. Additionally, the answer should reference the possible error values from clause 9.2 and the V2X service discovery procedure from TS 24.486 clause 6.6."
"Describe the procedures involved in releasing MGW resources for different sides (outgoing, destination, and originating) as per 3GPP TS 23.205.","The procedures for releasing MGW resources for different sides (outgoing, destination, and originating) as per 3GPP TS 23.205 are as follows:

1. **Outgoing Side:**
   - The GMSC server sends the Release message to the succeeding node.
   - Once the succeeding node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the outgoing side.
   - If any resources were seized in the MGW, the GMSC server uses the Release Bearer and Release Termination procedures to indicate to the MGW to remove the outgoing side bearer termination and that the bearer can be released towards the succeeding MGW.

2. **Destination Side:**
   - After the GMSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW, it sends the Release message to the succeeding node.
   - Once the succeeding node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the destination side.
   - The GMSC server uses the Release Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the destination side bearer termination.
   - The call clearing to the incoming side is performed as described in clause 7.1.1.2, which details the call clearing to the outgoing side.

3. **Originating Side:**
   - After the GMSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW, the GMSC server sends the Release message to the preceding node.
   - Once the preceding node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the originating side.
   - The GMSC server uses the Release Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the originating side bearer termination.
   - If the call is already established towards the destination side, call clearing to the destination side is performed as described in clause 7.1.1.2, which details the call clearing to the outgoing side.

These procedures ensure that the MGW resources are properly released for each side, maintaining efficient resource management and call clearing processes.","The answer should cover the following key details:
  - The sequence of messages exchanged between the GMSC server and MGW for releasing resources for each side (outgoing, destination, and originating).
  - The specific procedures used by the GMSC server to indicate the release of bearer termination to the MGW.
  - Any references to other clauses for additional procedures related to call clearing for different sides."
"Describe the behavior of the Mobile Station (MS) when an SMS transfer via GPRS fails, including the actions taken in different states and scenarios as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011.","When an SMS transfer via GPRS fails, the Mobile Station (MS) takes specific actions depending on the cause of the failure and the state of the Short Message Relay (SMR) entity. 

Initially, if the MS is attached to GPRS and the circuit-switched domain, and the SMS transfer via GPRS fails due to an RP-ERROR message with cause #69 or a complete lack of network response, the MS switches to the circuit-switched domain for SMS transfer for an implementation-dependent time. If the SMS transfer fails in both GPRS and the circuit-switched domain, the user is informed. Additionally, the MS may use the circuit-switched domain for SMS transfer if an RP-ERROR message with a different cause is received.

When the SMR entity is in the Idle state and receives a request to relay a TPDU, it forms and transfers the RP-DATA message, sets the timer TR1*, and enters the Wait for RP-ACK state. In the Wait for RP-ACK state, the SMR entity may receive an RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message, an error indication from the CM-sublayer, or the timer TR1* may expire. Upon receiving an RP-ERROR message with cause #69, the MS proceeds as specified in subclause 2.6, switching to the circuit-switched domain for SMS transfer.

In the Wait for RP-ACK state, if the MS receives an RP-ERROR message with a permanent failure indication or an error indication from the CP-sublayer, it resets timer TR1M, passes a report indication to SM-TL, gives a CM-connection release request to the CM-sublayer, and enters the Idle state. If the RP-ERROR message indicates a temporary failure or timer TR1M expires, the MS examines the RETRANS flag. If the RETRANS flag is set, indicating no more transmissions are permitted, the MS passes a report indication to SM-TL, gives a CM-connection release request to the CM-sublayer, resets the RETRANS flag and TR1M, and enters the Idle state. If the RETRANS flag is not set, the MS gives a CM-connection release request to the CM-sublayer, sets the RETRANS flag, resets TR1M, starts timer TRAM, and enters the Wait for Retrans Timer state.

Throughout these processes, the use of timers (TR1*, TR2*, TR1M, TRAM) and the RETRANS flag helps manage retransmissions and state transitions, ensuring the MS handles SMS transfer failures effectively.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The initial actions taken by the MS when SMS transfer via GPRS fails, including switching to the circuit-switched domain and informing the user if both methods fail.
- The behavior of the SMR entity in different states (Idle, Wait for RP-ACK, Wait to Send RP-ACK) and the specific actions taken upon receiving RP-ACK, RP-ERROR, or error indications.
- The handling of RP-ERROR cause #69 in different scenarios and states.
- The use of timers (TR1*, TR2*, TR1M, TRAM) and the RETRANS flag in managing retransmissions and state transitions."
"Describe the procedures and responses involved when an IWF receives a SIP request for an MCPTT emergency call, including both authorized and unauthorized scenarios.","When an Interworking Function (IWF) performing the controlling role receives a SIP request for an MCPTT emergency call, it follows specific procedures to determine whether the request is authorized or unauthorized.

1. **Verification Process**:
   - The IWF first checks the <emergency-ind> element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body of the SIP request. If this element is set to 'true', the IWF proceeds to verify the authorization.
   - For an MCPTT group call, the IWF obtains the MCPTT user profile as described in 3GPP TS 24.484 and the group information per 3GPP TS 24.481.
   - The IWF checks if the MCPTT user is authorized to initiate emergency calls and if the group is configured to allow emergency calls.

2. **Criteria for Authorization**:
   - If the user is authorized and the group allows emergency calls, the request is considered authorized, and the IWF processes the emergency group call.
   - If the user or group does not meet the authorization criteria, the request is considered unauthorized.

3. **Actions for Authorized Requests**:
   - For authorized requests, the IWF processes the emergency call without further checks.

4. **Actions for Unauthorized Requests**:
   - For unauthorized requests, the IWF sends a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.
   - The SIP 403 response includes an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379, clause F.1.
   - The MIME body contains the <mcpttinfo> element, which includes the <mcptt-Params> element with the <emergency-ind> set to 'true'.

These procedures ensure that only authorized MCPTT emergency calls are processed, while unauthorized requests are appropriately rejected with detailed information in the response.","The answer should cover the following key details:
1. The process for verifying the authorization of an MCPTT emergency call request, including obtaining the MCPTT user profile and group information.
2. The criteria for determining whether the request is authorized or unauthorized.
3. The specific actions to be taken by the IWF for both authorized and unauthorized requests.
4. The format and required elements of the SIP 403 (Forbidden) response for unauthorized requests, including the inclusion of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body with the <mcpttinfo> and <mcptt-Params> elements."
"Describe the call flow and procedures for IMS origination via CS access for non-ICS UEs and ICS UEs, including the roles of MSC Server, MGCF, SCC AS, and S-CSCF.","The call flow and procedures for IMS origination via CS access for non-ICS UEs and ICS UEs involve several key steps and interactions between various network components, including the MSC Server, MGCF, SCC AS, and S-CSCF.

For non-ICS UEs attached to a legacy MSC or MSC-Server not enhanced for ICS, the call flow is as follows:
1. The UE A originates a call in the CS domain to party-B according to standard origination procedures.
2. The MSC Server responds with a Call Proceeding message and begins to set up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
3. The MSC-Server fetches an IP Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN) via IN (e.g., CAMEL) and routes the call towards the user's home IMS network using the IMRN via an MGCF.
4. The MGCF initiates an INVITE towards the I-CSCF in the home IMS of the originating ICS user.
5. The I-CSCF routes the INVITE based on standard procedures either directly to the SCC AS or via the S-CSCF.
6. When the INVITE arrives at the SCC AS, it invokes a B2BUA, terminating the UE A leg and originating the Remote Leg for presenting an IMS session towards the B-party on behalf of UE A. The SCC AS creates an INVITE containing the SDP received from MGCF, indicating CS voice or voice and video media. The original called number and the calling party number are used to set up the outgoing call leg to party-B. If required, the SCC AS adds User Location Information (e.g., CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the INVITE. The SCC AS sends the INVITE back to S-CSCF.
7-8. The S-CSCF sends the INVITE further for completion of the call toward the remote end.

For originating sessions using CS media by non-ICS UEs registered in IMS by the MSC Server:
1. The non-ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating session toward the MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
2. The MSC Server performs interworking between the I2 reference point and CS signalling and controls a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform interworking between CS access bearers and RTP bearers on the Mb reference point.
3. For video call originating sessions, the MSC Server performs video codec negotiation and sets up the video media bearer based on defined procedures.

For ICS UEs dialing an E.164 number, Tel URI, or SIP-URI user=phone:
1. The ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating using the B-party's E.164 number or a number derived from the Tel-URI.
2. The call is routed to IMS via an MSC Server enhanced for ICS or a standard MSC Server using IN-based re-direction.

Implementation dependencies exist for the discovery of the original called number, calling party number, User Location Information, and UE Time Zone Information. These can be realized by interactions between the SCC AS and the SCF (e.g., gsmSCF) or retrieved from the MSC via the HSS.

Overall, the MSC Server, MGCF, SCC AS, and S-CSCF play crucial roles in the call setup process, ensuring proper routing, interworking, and session control for both non-ICS and ICS UEs.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Detailed call flow steps for IMS origination via CS access for non-ICS UEs and ICS UEs.
  - Roles and interactions of MSC Server, MGCF, SCC AS, and S-CSCF in the call setup process.
  - Specific handling for video calls and emergency sessions.
  - Implementation dependencies for discovery of original called number, calling party number, User Location Information, and UE Time Zone Information."
"Describe the format and structure of SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier) in 5G networks, including the different types of identifiers it can contain and how they are represented.","In 5G networks, the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) is a key identifier used to uniquely identify a mobile subscriber. The SUPI can contain different types of identifiers, including the Global Line Identifier (GLI), Global Cell Identifier (GCI), and International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).

1. **SUPI Containing GLI**:
   - The format of a SUPI containing a GLI is specified as a Network Access Identifier (NAI).
   - The NAI format is `username@realm`, where the username part is the GLI and the realm part identifies the operator owning the subscription.
   - Example format: `GLI@5gc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org`.

2. **SUPI Containing GCI**:
   - Similar to the GLI, a SUPI containing a GCI also takes the form of an NAI.
   - The username part is the GCI, and the realm part identifies the operator.
   - Example formats: `00-00-5E-00-53-00@5gc.mnc012.mcc345.3gppnetwork.org` or `00-00-5E-00-53-00@operator.com`.

3. **IMSI Structure**:
   - The IMSI is composed of three parts:
     1. Mobile Country Code (MCC) - three digits identifying the country of domicile.
     2. Mobile Network Code (MNC) - two or three digits identifying the home PLMN within the country.
     3. Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) - identifying the mobile subscription within a PLMN.
   - Example IMSI structure: `MCC-MNC-MSIN`.

The general format of SUPI as an NAI is detailed in clause 2.2 of IETF RFC 7542, and specific formats involving GLI and GCI are referenced in 3GPP TS 23.003 clauses 28.16.2 and 28.15.2 respectively.

"Explain the procedure for selecting SGSN services and interfaces during SRNS relocation and RIM procedures, including the construction of the RAI FQDN and the role of NAPTR records.","During SRNS relocation and RAN Information Management (RIM) procedures, the selection of SGSN services and interfaces is performed by an MME or Release-8 SGSN. The target Routing Area Code (RAC), Location Area Code (LAC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), and Mobile Country Code (MCC) are derived from the Target ID information. The S-NAPTR procedure is initiated to find a candidate set of SGSN services and interfaces serving the target Routing Area. This procedure uses specific Service Parameters such as 'x-3gpp-sgsn:x-gn', 'x-3gpp-sgsn:x-gp', 'x-3gpp-sgsn:x-s3', and 'x-3gpp-sgsn:x-nqprime'.

The Routing Area Identity (RAI) Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is constructed based on RAC, LAC, MNC, and MCC, following the format: rac<RAC>.lac<LAC>.rac.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org. The RAC and LAC are hex-coded digits, padded with zeros if necessary to ensure four-digit coding.

The S-NAPTR procedure outputs a list of host names, each associated with a service, protocol, port, and a list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This list represents the candidate SGSN nodes for the specified RAI. Operators can prioritize DNS records according to their preferences, which influences the selection process.

For pre-Release-8 compatibility, operators continue to provision A/AAAA records as specified in Annex C.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003, ensuring that pre-Release-8 nodes can perform selections using these records. Vendors must support pre-Release-8 DNS procedures on Release-8 SGSN.

NAPTR records play a crucial role in provisioning SGSN interfaces. Operators must provision NAPTR records under the RAI FQDN for each valid SGSN interface, using at least the specified Service Parameters. This provisioning can include the entire set of SGSN nodes in all SGSN pools serving the RAI, which helps distribute the load among SGSN nodes and avoid overloading default SGSN nodes. The prioritization and weighting of DNS records can bias the selection towards SGSN nodes closest to the geographical region covered by the RAI.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of MME or Release-8 SGSN in selecting target RAC, LAC, MNC, and MCC during SRNS relocation and RIM procedures.
- The S-NAPTR procedure for finding candidate SGSN services and interfaces, including the Service Parameters used.
- The construction of the RAI FQDN based on RAC, LAC, MNC, and MCC.
- The logical output of the S-NAPTR procedure, including host names, service, protocol, port, and IP addresses.
- The prioritization of DNS records by operators.
- The handling of pre-Release-8 compatibility and the use of A/AAAA records.
- The role of NAPTR records in provisioning SGSN interfaces and the impact on load distribution among SGSN nodes."
"Describe the functionalities and security measures associated with the CAPIF reference points (CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4, and CAPIF-5) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 and TS 33.122.","The CAPIF reference points (CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4, and CAPIF-5) are integral components within the 3GPP framework, each serving distinct functionalities and adhering to specific security measures.

CAPIF-3 Reference Point:
The CAPIF-3 reference point exists between the API exposing function and the CAPIF core function. It is primarily used for exercising access and policy-related control for service API communications initiated by the API invoker. The key functionalities of CAPIF-3 include:
- Authenticating the API invoker based on their identity and credentials.

- Monitoring the status of service APIs (e.g., pilot or live status, start or stop status).
- Registering API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function.
- Updating registration information of API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function.

Security Measures:
To ensure the security of interfaces between CAPIF entities within a trusted domain (CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4, CAPIF-5), several security measures are specified:
- TLS (Transport Layer Security) is mandatory to provide integrity protection, replay protection, and confidentiality protection. Security profiles for TLS implementation and usage must follow the provisions given in TS 33.310, Annex E.
- Certificate-based mutual authentication must be performed between CAPIF entities using TLS. This authentication follows the profiles given in TS 33.310, subclauses 6.1.3a and 6.1.4a.
- The structure of the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) used for the certificate is out of scope of the present document.
- It is up to the domain administrator's policy to protect interfaces within the trusted domain.

It should also include the security measures specified in TS 33.122, such as the mandatory use of TLS for integrity, replay, and confidentiality protection, and certificate-based mutual authentication. Additionally, the answer should mention the role of the domain administrator's policy in protecting interfaces within the trusted domain."
"Describe the measurement and distribution of physical resource blocks (PRBs) usage in both downlink and uplink scenarios, including the key elements and their significance in network capacity planning and load balancing.","The measurement and distribution of physical resource blocks (PRBs) usage in both downlink and uplink scenarios are crucial for understanding and managing network load and capacity. 

For the downlink scenario, the measurement provides the distribution of samples with total usage (in percentage) of PRBs on the downlink in different ranges. This measurement helps determine whether a cell is under high load, especially in situations where the cell may experience high load for short periods and recover quickly. Each measurement sample is obtained according to the definition in TS 36.314 clause 4.1.10.1. Based on the sample value, the appropriate bin of the counter is increased, and the number of samples during one measurement period is provided by the operator. The distribution is represented by a set of integers, each indicating the number of samples with a downlink PRB percentage usage in the range represented by that bin. The key element for downlink PRB usage distribution is RRU.PrbTotDlDist.BinX, which indicates the distribution of downlink PRB usage for all traffic. This information is valid for packet-switched traffic and is a key input to network capacity planning and load balancing.

Similarly, for the uplink scenario, the measurement provides the distribution of samples with total usage (in percentage) of PRBs on the uplink in different usage ranges. This measurement is useful for assessing whether a cell is under high load, particularly in situations where the cell may experience high load for short periods and recover quickly. Each measurement sample is obtained according to the definition in TS 36.314 clause 4.1.10.1, and the proper bin of the counter is increased based on the sample value. The number of samples during one measurement period is provided by the operator. The distribution is represented by a set of integers, each indicating the number of samples with an uplink PRB percentage usage in the range represented by that bin. The key element for uplink PRB usage distribution is RRU.PrbTotUlDist.BinX, which indicates the distribution of uplink PRB usage for all traffic. This information is also valid for packet-switched traffic and is essential for network capacity planning and load balancing.

Additionally, the protocol layer (MAC) plays a role in these measurements, with considerations for PRBs that may be considered not available, such as MBSFN subframes and subframes subject to restrictions due to TDM ICIC. These considerations are up to the eNB implementation and affect how P(n) is calculated with respect to unavailable PRBs.

Overall, the distribution information of PRB usage in both downlink and uplink scenarios is a key input to network capacity planning and load balancing, helping operators manage and optimize network performance effectively.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Explanation of how downlink and uplink PRB usage is measured and distributed.
  - The process of obtaining measurement samples and binning them.
  - The significance of these measurements in network capacity planning and load balancing.
  - Considerations for unavailable PRBs in the calculation as per the MAC protocol layer."
Describe the syntax and functionality of specific AT commands used for call control and UE test loop functions as defined in 3GPP TS 27.007 and related documents.,"The AT command +CHCCS is used to initiate hangup and perform call clearing for a call identified by <ccidx>. The parameter <cause> can be added to indicate the reason for call clearing, with values such as 0 (No particular cause), 1 (Normal call clearing), 2 (Call rejected), and 3 (User busy). A special form, +CHCCS=0, clears all calls identified by <ccidx>. The information text +CHCCSI:<ccidx> is provided for each call where hangup is successfully initiated. The command is mandatory when +CDU is implemented in the TA.

For UE test loop functions, several AT commands are defined:
- +CATM activates/deactivates UE test mode and sets the UE into test loop mode.
- +CCUTLE opens/closes UE test loop mode E for V2X communication packets.
- +CUSPCREQ requests the UE to report successful reception counters for sidelink PSCCH transport blocks, STCH PDCP SDU packets, and PSSCH transport blocks.
- +CUTCR resets the UTC time calculated from GNSS in the UE.
- +CCBRREQ requests the UE to report the channel busy ratio (CBR).
- +CV2XDTS triggers the UE to start/stop sending V2X data over E-UTRA or NR PC5.
- +CSPSAIR requests the UE to send UEAssistanceInformation message for SPS grant from eNB.

Clause 9.2 provides possible <err> values related to these AT commands.

General procedures for call control during a call include commands for call deflection, call waiting, call hold, multi-party services, explicit call transfer, and completion of calls to busy subscriber. Specific command sequences followed by SEND are used to control these operations, such as entering 0 followed by SEND to release all held calls or set User Determined User Busy (UDUB) for a waiting call, and entering 1 followed by SEND to release all active calls and accept the held or waiting call.","The answer must include a detailed explanation of the +CHCCS command syntax and its parameters, including the special form +CHCCS=0 and the information text +CHCCSI.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in TA/EPS Location Update events as specified in 3GPP TS 33.107, including the scenarios in which these events are triggered and the information elements delivered.","TA/EPS Location Update events are generated to provide information about the new location of a UE (User Equipment) during various scenarios. These scenarios include Tracking Area Update, UE triggered Service Request, X2 based handover, S1 based handover, and when the MME (Mobility Management Entity) receives location information over S1. In the event of a change of MME, the new MME is responsible for sending the update-event, while the old MME may optionally send the event as well.

The elements involved in these events are delivered to the DF2 (Data Function 2) if available. These elements are particularly applicable for HeNB (Home eNodeB) interception. Additionally, when the target UE is a ProSe (Proximity Services) UE-to-NW (Network) Relay, the elements identify the ProSe remote UEs connected to the relay.

What are the spurious emission requirements for different TDD options in 3GPP TS 25.105?,"Spurious emissions are emissions caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products, and frequency conversion products, but exclude out-of-band emissions. These emissions are measured at the base station antenna connector and apply to all types of transmitters, whether single carrier or multi carrier, and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer.

For the 3.84 Mcps TDD option, the spurious emission requirements apply at frequencies within the specified frequency ranges that are more than 12.5 MHz below the first carrier frequency used or more than 12.5 MHz above the last carrier frequency used. For the 1.28 Mcps TDD option, the mandatory spurious emission requirement applies from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from 4 MHz below the lowest frequency of each operating band to 4 MHz above the highest frequency of each operating band. For base stations capable of multi-band operation with multiple bands mapped on the same antenna connector, this exclusion applies to all supported operating bands. For base stations with multiple bands mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply, and the multi-band exclusions and provisions are not applicable. For the 7.68 Mcps TDD option, the requirements apply at frequencies within the specified frequency ranges that are more than 25 MHz below the first carrier frequency used or more than 25 MHz above the last carrier frequency used. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The specific requirements for spurious emissions are detailed in subclauses 6.6.3.1.1 and 6.6.3.1.2.

"Describe the functionalities and interactions of the PCRF as defined in TS 29.217, particularly in the context of congestion mitigation and roaming scenarios.","The Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) is a critical component in network management, responsible for policy control decisions and flow-based charging control functionalities. One of its key roles involves interacting with the Resource and Congestion Awareness Function (RCAF) to manage congestion mitigation. The PCRF can receive Resource Usage Congestion Information (RUCI) from the RCAF, which it uses to make informed policy decisions. It has the capability to provide, update, or remove reporting restrictions of RUCI, and can enable or disable RUCI reporting for specific user and PDN IDs. Additionally, the PCRF can manage the reporting of congestion location identifiers and remove context at the RCAF for given user and PDN IDs.

In the context of roaming scenarios, the functionalities of the PCRF are applied differently based on the type of access. For home-routed access scenarios, the functionalities defined in clause 4.3.2 of TS 29.217 are applicable. This includes the reporting of congestion information to the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN), which can be particularly useful for groups of PLMNs that belong to a single business entity. Similarly, for visited access scenarios, the same functionalities are applied, ensuring that the PCRF can effectively manage policy control and congestion mitigation even when the user equipment (UE) is roaming in a visited network.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The role of PCRF in policy control and flow-based charging control.
  - How PCRF interacts with RCAF for RUCI reporting and congestion mitigation.
  - The specific functionalities of PCRF in home-routed access scenarios, including the reporting of congestion information to HPLMN.

Describe the process and key elements involved in creating a subscription and receiving notifications in the UCMF as per 3GPP TS 29.673 specifications.,"The process of creating a subscription and receiving notifications in the UCMF as per 3GPP TS 29.673 specifications involves several key steps and elements.

Firstly, the Subscribe service operation is used by an NF Service Consumer, such as an AMF, to create a subscription in the UCMF. This subscription allows the NF Service Consumer to receive notifications for the creation of new dictionary entries or the deletion of PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability IDs. To create a subscription, the NF Service Consumer sends an HTTP POST request to the URI of the subscriptions collection. The request payload must include a representation of the individual subscription resource to be created, and it may also contain an expiry time indicating how long the subscription should remain active.

Upon a successful subscription creation, the UCMF responds with a status code 201 and includes an HTTP Location header that provides the location of the newly created subscription resource. The response may also include the expiry time determined by the UCMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. If the expiry time is not included in the response, the subscription is considered valid indefinitely. In case of failure or redirection, the UCMF returns one of the HTTP status codes listed in the relevant table, and the response message may contain a ProblemDetails structure with an appropriate error cause.

Once a subscription is created, the Notify service operation is used by the UCMF to send notifications to the specified notification URI when the subscribed events occur. The UCMF sends an HTTP POST request to the notification URI provided during the subscription creation. On successful notification delivery, the NF Service Consumer responds with a status code 204 (No Content). If there is a failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code is returned, and the response message may include additional error information.

In summary, the key elements involved in this process include the use of HTTP POST requests for both creating subscriptions and sending notifications, handling of success and failure responses with appropriate status codes, and the inclusion of necessary details such as the notification URI and expiry time in the requests and responses.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the Subscribe service operation and its purpose.
  - Steps involved in creating a subscription, including the HTTP POST request and required payload details.
  - Handling of success responses, including the HTTP Location header, status code 201, and expiry time considerations.
  - Handling of failure responses, including relevant HTTP status codes and ProblemDetails structure.
  - Explanation of the Notify service operation and its purpose.
  - Steps involved in sending notifications, including the HTTP POST request and expected responses.
  - Handling of success responses, including '204 No content'.
  - Handling of failure responses, including relevant HTTP status codes and additional error information."
"What are the requirements for supporting Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) in various scenarios including roaming, voice, video, and DTS sessions?","The requirements for supporting Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) in various scenarios are detailed in the specifications. Firstly, MPS must be supported when the Service User is roaming, provided both the visited network and home network support MPS and roaming agreements are in place.

For MMTEL voice or voice conference calls, the system must be capable of authenticating and authorizing requests from UEs with MPS subscriptions. It must also support requests from UEs without MPS subscriptions, where the Service User provides predetermined MPS credentials such as a calling card number, PIN, or security token. The visited PLMN, whether within or outside the home country, must verify with the home PLMN that the UE is authorized for MPS and authorize the MPS request. Additionally, the system must support upgrading all participants of an MMTEL voice conference call to MPS priority.

Similarly, for MMTEL video or video conference calls, the system must authenticate and authorize requests from UEs with MPS subscriptions and support requests from UEs without MPS subscriptions using predetermined MPS credentials. The visited PLMN must verify and authorize MPS requests with the home PLMN, and the system must support upgrading all participants of an MMTEL video conference call to MPS priority.

For DTS sessions, the system must authenticate and authorize requests from UEs with MPS subscriptions and support requests from UEs without MPS subscriptions using predetermined MPS credentials. It must also support requests from IoT devices with MPS subscriptions. The visited PLMN must verify and authorize MPS requests with the home PLMN. Additionally, the system must support enterprise networks requesting activation of MPS for DTS for specific MPS subscribed UEs or IoT devices, as well as groups of MPS subscribed UEs or IoT devices.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The necessity of both visited and home networks supporting MPS and having roaming agreements in place for MPS to be supported when roaming.
  - The system's capability to authenticate and authorize MPS requests for MMTEL voice, video, and DTS sessions from UEs with and without MPS subscriptions.

Describe the process and requirements for the MBS measurement reporting delay test as specified in 3GPP TS 37.571.,"The MBS measurement reporting delay test, as specified in 3GPP TS 37.571, is designed to evaluate the response time of a User Equipment (UE) in reporting measurements for a simulated beacon. The test involves several key parameters and steps:

1. **Beacon Parameters and Payload Fields**: The details of the beacon parameters are provided in Table 11.1.5-1 and Table 11.1.5-2. Table 11.1.5-1 outlines the general test parameters for the beacon, while Table 11.1.5-2 specifies the MBS Beacon Payload fields.

2. **Response Time Requirement**: The UE must report the measurement within a response time of less than 12300 milliseconds.

3. **Test Tolerances and Success Criteria**: The test tolerances are defined in clauses C.1.4 and C.4. The rate of successful tests during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%.

4. **Step-by-Step Procedure**:
   - **Step 1**: Set the MSS test parameters as specified in clause 11.1.5.
   - **Step 2**: The SS (Serving System) sends a RESET UE POSITIONING STORED INFORMATION message.
   - **Step 3**: The SS sends an LPP REQUEST CAPABILITIES message.
   - **Step 4**: The UE transmits an LPP PROVIDE CAPABILITIES message indicating the TBS capabilities supported by the UE in the TBS-ProvideCapabilities IE.
   - **Step 5**: The SS sends an LPP REQUEST LOCATION INFORMATION message, including the TBS-RequestLocationInformation IE. If the UE message at step 4 includes the ackRequested IE set to TRUE, the SS sends an acknowledgment in the LPP REQUEST LOCATION INFORMATION message.
   - **Step 6**: The UE performs and reports the code phase measurement for the simulated beacon. If the UE transmits a TBS-ProvideLocationInformation IE including the transmitterID and codePhase fields for the simulated beacon within the required response time, the number of successful tests is increased by one. Otherwise, the number of failure tests is increased by one.
   - **Step 7**: If the UE message at step 6 includes the ackRequested IE set to TRUE, the SS sends an LPP acknowledgment message.
   - **Step 8**: Repeat steps 1-7 until the confidence level according to Annex D is achieved. For each iteration, at step 1, reselect the PN code assigned to the MBS beacon.
   - **Step 9**: Release the signaling connection.

By following these steps and meeting the specified requirements, the MBS measurement reporting delay test ensures that the UE can accurately and promptly report measurements for a simulated beacon under the defined conditions.","The answer should include the following key details:

Explain the authentication and authorization procedures between the Content Provider and BM-SC as specified in 3GPP TS 29.116.,"The authentication and authorization procedures between the Content Provider and BM-SC as specified in 3GPP TS 29.116 involve several key steps and mechanisms. 

Firstly, authentication is performed via (D)TLS as defined in 3GPP TS 33.246. During the authentication process, the Content Provider acts as the (D)TLS client, and the BM-SC acts as the (D)TLS server when the Content Provider wants to provision new services or manage existing services. Conversely, the BM-SC acts as the client when it wishes to send reports and notifications to the Content Provider. Successful completion of the authentication procedure is required for all subsequent procedures.

Once the (D)TLS connection is established and authentication is successful, authorization procedures can be initiated. The authorization of the Content Provider towards the BM-SC may be based on the authenticated (D)TLS connection. The BM-SC checks if the Content Provider is authorized to send specific requests over this connection. Similarly, the authorization of the BM-SC towards the Content Provider for pushing notifications may also be based on the authenticated (D)TLS connection, with the Content Provider verifying the BM-SC's authorization to send specific notifications.

The BM-SC supports two modes of authorization for the Content Provider: domain-based and user-based. Domain-based authorization grants access rights at a coarse-grained level based on the Content Provider's administrative domain name in the certificate's subject field. User-based authorization grants access rights at a finer-grained level for individual representatives of the Content Provider, based on HTTP Digest authentication of username and password as specified in IETF RFC 7616. User-based authorization occurs after successful domain-based authorization.

Authorization of the BM-SC by the Content Provider follows the same mechanisms as described for BM-SC authorization of the Content Provider. Detailed specifications of the authorization procedure and affiliated mechanisms, such as pre-establishment of agreements on access rights and management of credentials, are outside the scope of this specification to allow flexibility in implementations.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The use of (D)TLS for authentication between the Content Provider and BM-SC.
  - The roles of the Content Provider and BM-SC during the authentication process.

Describe the procedures and requirements for IPv4 address allocation in Proxy Mobile IPv6 PDN connections as specified in 3GPP TS 29.275.,"The procedures and requirements for IPv4 address allocation in Proxy Mobile IPv6 PDN connections as specified in 3GPP TS 29.275 involve several key steps and checks. 

Firstly, upon reception of a Proxy Binding Update (PBU), the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) initiates the 'Binding Lifetime Extension without Handover' procedures. These procedures are described in the PMIPv6 and IPv4 support for PMIPv6 specifications. The LMA must ensure the following additional requirements are met:
1. The received IPv4 Home address must be checked for topological correctness to ensure it is appropriate for the network topology.
2. An IPv4 Home Address must be allocated for the selected Packet Data Network (PDN).
3. Parameters in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) must be set as specified by the PBA parameters section for this procedure.

Additionally, the Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW) is required to follow the LMA procedure for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PDN Connection IPv4 Address Allocation Procedure as defined in sub clause 5.6.3.

"Describe the process and conditions under which the AM Policy Association is updated for a 5G-RG or FN-RG, including the relevant triggers and interactions between AMF and PCF.","The AM Policy Association is updated for a 5G-RG (5G Residential Gateway) or FN-RG (Fixed Network Residential Gateway) under specific conditions. The input data required for this update is listed in clause 5.2.5.2.5 of TS 23.502. However, there are exceptions to the notification triggers for UE location change, PRA changes, and RFSP index change if the RG registers only on Wireline access. When a 5G RG registers on a second access using Hybrid access, PCRT (Policy Control Request Trigger) on UE location change applies.

When the UE registers via W-5GAN (Wireline 5G Access Network), the output information is defined in clause 9.5, and the applicable Policy Control Request triggers are detailed in clause 9.5.3. The Access type change trigger requests the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) to report a new Access Type and RAT (Radio Access Technology) Type to the PCF (Policy Control Function). If the UE simultaneously connects over both 3GPP and wireline non-3GPP access types, the AMF reports the list of Access Type and RAT combinations available in the UE access and mobility context in the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update service operation.

The Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for AMF and wireline access type are defined in Table 6.1.2.5 of TS 23.503. For W-5GAN scenarios, certain triggers are not supported, including location change (tracking area), change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, RFSP index change, UE-AMBR change, and PLMN change. Additionally, specific PCR triggers are added for wireline access type, and UE Policy related triggers like location change, PRA change, and PLMN change are not applicable for wireline access.

The Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update service operation allows the AMF to request an update of the AM Policy Association to receive updated access and mobility-related policy information for the UE context when a Policy Control Request Trigger is met or the AMF is relocated due to UE mobility. Required inputs for this service operation include the AM Policy Association ID, while optional inputs may include information on the Policy Control Request Trigger condition, GUAMI(s), list of NWDAF instance IDs and corresponding Analytics IDs, and Target NSSAI. The outputs include a success status and optionally, access and mobility-related policy information for the UE context and Policy Control Request Triggers of the AM Policy Association.","The answer should cover the following key points:

What are the requirements for intra-frequency cell identification and measurement reporting as specified in TS 38.133?,"The requirements for intra-frequency cell identification and measurement reporting as specified in TS 38.133 include several key conditions and time periods. 

Firstly, an intra-frequency cell is considered detectable when specific conditions related to SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, SS-SINR, and SSB_RP measurements are met. These conditions are detailed in TS 38.133 sections 10.1.2, 10.1.3, 10.1.7, 10.1.8, 10.1.12, and 10.1.13 for frequency ranges FR1 and FR2.

The UE must be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within specific time periods, which vary depending on whether the UE is configured to report SSB-based RRM measurement results with the associated SSB index. If the UE is not configured to report these results or if the neighbor cell is synchronous with the serving cell, the identification must occur within Tidentify_intra_without_index. Otherwise, it must occur within Tidentify_intra_with_index. These time periods are defined as follows:
- Tidentify_intra_without_index = TPSS/SSS_sync_intra + TSSB_measurement_period_intra
- Tidentify_intra_with_index = TPSS/SSS_sync_intra + TSSB_measurement_period_intra + TSSB_time_index_intra

The specific values for TPSS/SSS_sync_intra, TSSB_measurement_period_intra, and TSSB_time_index_intra are provided in Table 4.6.1.0.2 for both FR1 and FR2.

Additionally, the measurement periods for intra-frequency measurements with gaps are specified in Table 4.6.1.0.2-4 for FR1 and Table 4.6.1.0.2-5 for FR2. These periods depend on the SCG DRX cycle if SCG DRX is in use; otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use apply.

Regarding measurement reporting, the UE must meet the requirements for reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements as specified in TS 38.133 sections 10.1.2.1, 10.1.3.1, 10.1.7.1, 10.1.8.1, 10.1.12.1, and 10.1.13.1. The UE should not send any event-triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled. The measurement reporting delay, which is the time between an event triggering a report and the UE starting to transmit the report, must be less than Tidentify_intra_with_index or Tidentify_intra_without_index, depending on the configuration. If L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell becomes undetectable and then detectable again, triggering an event, the event-triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than TMeasurement_Period, Intra, provided the timing to that cell has not changed significantly and the measurement gap has not been available.

These requirements are detailed in TS 38.133 clauses 9.2.2, 9.2.6.2, 9.2.6.3, and 9.2.4.3.","The answer should cover the conditions under which an intra-frequency cell is considered detectable, the specific time periods for detection and measurement for FR1 and FR2, the impact of SCG DRX cycles on these periods, and the requirements for measurement reporting delays. It should also include references to the relevant sections of TS 38.133 for completeness."
Describe the new slot formats proposed in TS 25.903 and their configuration and switching mechanisms.,"The new slot formats proposed in TS 25.903 include slot format 1* and slot format 4. Slot format 1* is associated with the existing slot format 1 and can be configured by the Radio Network Controller (RNC). When slot format 1* is configured, it can switch to slot format 1 during certain periods when more pilot energy is required, according to predefined rules. This allows compatibility with Node B's that do not support the new slot format. Slot format 4, on the other hand, can be configured by the RNC in the normal way and does not depend on transmission activity on other channels.

The configuration of the new slot format is done by Radio Resource Control (RRC) signalling, similar to the Rel-99 slot formats. The new slot format uses 5 pilot bits and 5 Transmit Power Control (TPC) bits. During DPCCH slots that overlap with Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) transmission, the slot format switches dynamically to format 1 (8 pilots + 2 TPC) to avoid degrading the High-Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) performance. The Serving Node B knows exactly when to expect transmissions on the High-Speed Dedicated Physical Control Channel (HS-DPCCH), eliminating the need for blind detection of the change in DPCCH slot format. In other DPCCH slots, including those where Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is transmitted (unless HS-DPCCH is also transmitted), the new slot format continues to be used.

The initiation and termination of Continuous Packet Connectivity (CPC) operation differ for the two proposals. For Proposal A, CPC initiation involves configuring the use of slot format 1* by RRC signalling. Predefined rules for switching between slot format 1* and slot format 1 can be used, such as using slot format 1 in all DPCCH slots that start at the beginning of or during HS-DPCCH, DPDCH, or E-DPCCH transmission, and using slot format 1* in all other DPCCH slots. The HS-DSCH Serving Node B can predict when HS-DPCCH transmissions will occur and derive the channel estimate accordingly. For E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH transmission, the change of slot format can be detected based on detected E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH energy.

For Proposal B, slot format 4 would be configured by the RNC in the normal way, so fast switching would not occur. A combination of Proposals A and B could also be considered, allowing the RNC to configure the new slot format either to be used in all slots (by configuring slot format 4) or only in inactive slots (by configuring slot format 1 and enabling the use of slot format 1*).","The answer should include details on the new slot formats 1* and 4, their configuration by the RNC, the dynamic switching mechanism for slot format 1*, the impact on HS-DSCH performance, and the detection mechanisms for slot format changes. It should also cover the initiation and termination of CPC operation for these slot formats and the possibility of combining Proposals A and B."
"Explain the roles and interactions of POIs, Triggering Functions, and MDFs in the interception process as defined in 3GPP TS 33.127.","In the interception process defined in 3GPP TS 33.127, Points of Interception (POIs) are divided into two categories: directly provisioned POIs and triggered POIs. Directly provisioned POIs are provisioned by the Lawful Interception Provisioning Function (LIPF) and detect the target's communications that need to be intercepted, deriving intercept related information or communication contents based on the POI type. Triggered POIs, on the other hand, are activated by a Triggering Function (TF) which detects target communications and sends a trigger to the associated POI, along with necessary interception rules, forwarding rules, target identity, and correlation information.

POIs are further divided into two types based on the data they send to the Mediation and Delivery Function (MDF): IRI-POIs and CC-POIs. IRI-POIs deliver Intercept Related Information (xIRI) to MDF2, while CC-POIs deliver Communication Contents (xCC) to MDF3. The xIRI is identified with the event that caused its generation within the IRI-POI.

The MDFs play a crucial role in delivering the interception products to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF). MDF2 generates IRI messages from xIRI and sends them to one or more LEMFs, while MDF3 generates CC from xCC and delivers it to one or more intercepting LEMFs. Both MDF2 and MDF3 are provisioned by the LIPF with the necessary intercept information to deliver the IRI and/or CC to the LEMFs. Additionally, the LI_MDF interface between MDF2 and MDF3 allows for information exchange between the two functions.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - Explanation of the two categories of POIs (directly provisioned and triggered) and their functions.

"Describe the requirements and functionalities of Lawful Access Location Services (LALS) as defined in 3GPP specifications, including the handling of location requests, priority levels, and reporting mechanisms.","Lawful Access Location Services (LALS) are defined in 3GPP specifications to provide location information for lawful interception purposes. Historically, TS 33.106 Annex B served as a reference for pre Rel-15 LI requirements, but it has been replaced by TS 33.126 from Rel-15 onwards.

LALS can report additional location information under various instances such as the use of services, network and radio resources, loss of service, commercial LCS queries, and network functions providing varying degrees of granularity and accuracy. National regulations impose several requirements on LALS, including the ability to target any UE served by the PLMN, reporting reasons for location positioning failures, positioning UEs under all required circumstances, and ensuring the target UE user is not notified of location attempts.

LALS must provide the most recent location information if requested and available, and its invocation should not cause service interruptions except for LCS priority cases. It supports both active and idle UEs, requests for current or last known positions, and must be flexible to accommodate evolving LCS mechanisms. Only authorized network functions and clients can provide LALS information, and it must support location in both circuit switched and packet switched domains.

Location requests for different services are processed with varying priority levels. Emergency services are given the highest priority, ensuring faster access to resources and more reliable location estimates. Operators can bar location services for specific users, but emergency services and other high-priority requests are processed regardless of barring status.

Reporting mechanisms require CSPs to report the location of the target at the beginning and end of calls and sessions, during ongoing communications, and for mobility management events. The location information must be trusted and verified by the 3GPP network, and for non-3GPP access networks, the entry point into the 3GPP core network must be reported. Third-party provided location information must also be reported if available.

Overall, LALS must ensure secure and reliable transmission of location information, support periodic reporting to LEAs, accommodate multiple LEAs with different update periods, and provide higher accuracy and security than commercial LCS services. The impact on network and UE performance must be managed, especially for multiple requests and periodic updates.","The answer must include:
  - The historical context and transition from TS 33.106 to TS 33.126.
  - Detailed instances and conditions under which additional location information can be reported.

What are the receiver spurious emissions requirements for repeater type 1-C in TDD operation according to 3GPP TS 38.115?,"The receiver spurious emissions power is defined as the power of emissions generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the antenna connector. These requirements apply specifically to repeater type 1-C for TDD operation. For each antenna connector on the BS-side and UE-side that supports both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the transmitter OFF state. In the case of antenna connectors on both the BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.5. For multi-band connectors that both transmit and receive in the operating band supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during the TX OFF state and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating band. Specifically, for Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious emissions requirements over all antenna connectors for repeater type 1-C must not exceed the minimum requirements defined in clause 6.5.5.5.

This is outlined in TS 31.111, specifically in clauses 5, 7.1, 8.1, 8.7, 8.13, and 11, as well as in TS 31.115 clause 4, and TS 23.038 clause 4.

TS 31.111 provides detailed specifications on the Proactive UICC: SMS-PP Data Download facility, including the necessary functionalities and requirements that the ME must adhere to. TS 31.115 further elaborates on these requirements, particularly focusing on clause 4.

"Describe the offline charging functionality for MMTel services as specified in the 3GPP TS 32.275 documents, including the types of Diameter Charging Data Requests and their triggers.","The offline charging functionality for MMTel (Multimedia Telephony) services, as specified in the 3GPP TS 32.275 documents, is based on the Charging Trigger Functions (CTFs) reporting accounting information by sending Diameter Charging Data Requests to the Charging Data Function (CDF). There are four types of Diameter Charging Data Requests: start, interim, stop, and event. The use of these requests depends on the supplementary service type and is determined for each service.

The basic principles outlined in TS 32.275 5.2.1 explain that these triggers can be configured to regroup several MMTel supplementary services, allowing for improved handling of interactions requirements associated with these services. Further details on the circumstances and triggers for these requests are specified in clause 5.2.2.

According to TS 32.275 6.1.3.2, the accounting information for MMTel services charging is transferred from the CTFs to the CDF using the appropriate Charging Data Request messages. The process within the CDF follows the same principles as described for SIP sessions in TS 32.260. Specifically, an MMTel Charging Data Record (CDR) is opened upon reception of a Charging Data Request [start] message, closed upon reception of a Charging Data Request [stop] message, updated upon reception of a Charging Data Request [interim] message, and created upon reception of a Charging Data Request [event] message.","The answer should include an explanation of the basic principles of MMTel offline charging functionality, the types of Diameter Charging Data Requests (start, interim, stop, event), and the circumstances under which each type is used.

"Describe the lawful interception (LI) architecture for Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) using Network Exposure Function (NEF) in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios, including the roles of NEF and V-SMF.","In the context of lawful interception (LI) for Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) using Network Exposure Function (NEF), the architecture varies between non-roaming and roaming scenarios.

In a non-roaming scenario, the NEF is solely responsible for providing the Intercept Related Information Point of Interception (IRI-POI) and Communication Content Point of Interception (CC-POI) functions. This means that all interception activities are handled by the NEF within the home network.

In a roaming scenario, the responsibilities are divided between the visited network and the home network. The Visited Session Management Function (V-SMF) in the visited network provides the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for the roaming user. Meanwhile, the NEF in the home network continues to provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for the home network. It is important to note that only home-routed mode applies in this scenario.

For LI in the Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN), the process involves the duplication of packets without any modification at the V-SMF (in case of roaming) and NEF in the home network. These duplicated packets, which include additional information in the header, are sent to the Mediation Function 3 (MDF3) via the LI_X3 interface for further delivery to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) via the LI_HI3 interface. Figure 7.8-5 in the documents provides a visual representation of this architecture, showing the V-SMF as a Control Plane Network Function (CP NF) and User Plane Network Function (UP NF) providing the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for NIDD using NEF in the visited network.

Additionally, NEF serves as the anchor point for PDU session establishment and NIDD traffic. The NIDD traffic is forwarded by NEF to the Application Function (AF) over the N33 interface, as illustrated in Figure 7.9-1.

In summary, the NEF plays a central role in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios, with the V-SMF taking on additional responsibilities in the visited network during roaming. The architecture ensures that interception activities are effectively managed and that NIDD traffic is appropriately forwarded.","The answer should cover the roles of NEF and V-SMF in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios, including the specific functions they provide (IRI-POI and CC-POI). It should explain the home-routed mode application, the packet duplication process in the VPLMN, and the forwarding of NIDD traffic by NEF to the AF over the N33 interface.

Describe the testing procedure and requirements for IAB-DU types 1-O and 2-O as specified in 3GPP TS 38.176.,"The testing procedure for IAB-DU types 1-O and 2-O as specified in 3GPP TS 38.176 involves several detailed steps to ensure proper alignment, configuration, signal adjustment, and measurement. 

Firstly, the IAB-DU should be placed with its manufacturer-declared coordinate system reference point at the same location as the calibrated point in the test system. The orientation of the IAB node must be aligned with the test system, and the IAB-DU should be aligned with the test antenna in the declared direction to be tested. Additionally, the polarization of the wanted signal and interferer signal must match with the test antenna(s).

The beam peak direction for the transmitter should be configured according to the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier. The test signal mean power must be set so that the calibrated radiated power at the IAB Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified. This involves adjusting the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in subclause 7.9.5.1 for IAB-DU type 1-O and subclause 7.9.5.2 for IAB-DU type 2-O, and similarly adjusting the signal generator for the interfering signal.

Throughput should be measured according to annex A.1 for each supported polarization. The measurement should be repeated with the wanted signal on the other side of the FC, and the interfering signal at the opposite side of the FC and adjacent to the wanted signal. This process should be repeated for all specified measurement directions and supported polarizations. For multi-band RIBs, the steps should be repeated per involved band with single band test configurations and test models, ensuring no carrier is activated in the other band.

For IAB-DU type 2-O, the throughput must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1, with parameters detailed in table 7.9.5.2-1. This requirement applies to each supported polarization under the assumption of polarization match.

For IAB-DU type 1-O, the throughput must also be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1, with parameters detailed in tables 7.9.5.1-1 for Wide Area IAB-DU, 7.9.5.1-2 for Medium Range IAB-DU, and 7.9.5.1-3 for Local Area IAB-DU. This requirement applies when the AoA of the incident wave of the received signal and the interfering signal are in the same direction and within the minSENS RoAoA, under the assumption of polarization match.","The answer must include the detailed steps for setting up the IAB-DU in the test system, including alignment, configuration, signal adjustment, and measurement procedures. It should also cover the throughput requirements for both IAB-DU type 1-O and type 2-O, specifying the conditions under which these requirements apply, and referencing the relevant tables for in-channel selectivity."
Describe the procedures and AVPs involved when a Diameter Redirect Agent (DRA) redirects a Diameter request message according to 3GPP TS 29.213 and IETF RFC 6733.,"When a Diameter Redirect Agent (DRA) redirects a Diameter request message, it follows specific procedures and utilizes various Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 and IETF RFC 6733. The DRA redirects the received Diameter request message by carrying out the procedures outlined in clause 6.1.7 of IETF RFC 6733. The Client uses the value within the Redirect-Host AVP of the redirect response to obtain the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) identity.

There are two primary scenarios for setting the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP based on the PCRF routing information:
1. If the PCRF routing information is per User Equipment Network Access Identifier (UE-NAI), the DRA sets the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_USER. In this case, the DRA client may contact the DRA upon IP-CAN session termination.
2. If the PCRF routing information is per IP-CAN session, the DRA sets the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_SESSION. Here, the DRA client must contact the DRA upon IP-CAN session termination.

Additionally, the DRA may provide the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP in the redirect response to indicate the lifetime of the cached route table entry created from the Redirect-Host and Redirect-Host-Usage AVP values, as described in clause 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733.

The DRA must be aware of Gx and Gxx Diameter termination requests, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212, to detect whether the release of DRA bindings is required. If the DRA maintains PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session, it should be aware of IP-CAN session modification requests over Gx, which update the IPv4 address of the UE by the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF).

For clients that are Application Functions (AF), the DRA does not need to maintain Diameter sessions, and Diameter Base redirect procedures are applicable. Therefore, an AF should not send an AF session termination request to the DRA.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the DRA in redirecting Diameter request messages.
  - The use of the Redirect-Host AVP to obtain the PCRF identity.
  - The scenarios for setting the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP (ALL_USER and ALL_SESSION).
  - The purpose of the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP.
  - The DRA's awareness of Gx and Gxx Diameter termination requests and IP-CAN session modification requests.

"Describe the test purpose, applicability, and procedure for verifying CSI-RS based L1-RSRP relative measurement accuracy as specified in 3GPP TS 38.533.","The purpose of the test is to verify that the CSI-RS based L1-RSRP relative measurement accuracy is within the specified limits for all bands. This test applies to all types of NR UE supporting E-UTRA and EN-DC from Release 15 onwards. The minimum conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 clause A.4.7.4.2.

The initial conditions involve configuring the test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) according to the parameters specified in the relevant tables. The UE must be synchronized to the PSCell and configured for periodic CSI reporting in PUCCH with a specified reporting periodicity. The connection setup is done according to the settings in TS 38.508-1.

The test procedure includes several steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific connectivity parameters.
2. Set the test parameters according to the specified duration.
3. The UE starts sending L1-RSRP reports including results of both CSI-RS#0 and CSI-RS#1 every 80 slots.
4. The SS checks the L1-RSRP reported values of CSI-RS#0 and CSI-RS#1 in the periodic reports and compares the DIFF-RSRP value to the expected DIFF-RSRP. The number of passed or failed iterations is recorded based on whether the reported values are within the specified limits.
5. The SS continues checking the L1-RSRP report messages until the confidence level is achieved.
6. Repeat the steps for each sub-test as appropriate.

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell. The accuracy requirements are valid under specific conditions, including reference sensitivity and L1-RSRP measurement conditions. The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs with a density of 3, and the performance with larger bandwidth is expected to be equal to or better than the specified accuracy requirements.

Describe the functionality and conditions under which the Connected Line Identification Restriction (COLR) Supplementary Service can be overridden according to 3GPP TS 22.081.,"The Connected Line Identification Restriction (COLR) Supplementary Service is designed to prevent the presentation of the connected line identity to the calling party. This service is applicable to all basic services subscribed to by the user and is not provisioned for any subset of these services.

The COLR can be overridden under specific conditions, primarily through the use of override categories. These categories are defined within a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)/PLMN, and between ISDNs/PLMNs. Depending on national regulations, certain networks may establish categories of subscribers, such as emergency services (e.g., the police), who have the ability to override the presentation restriction and have the connected line identity presented. This ability to override is a national option and is only applicable within the Home PLMN (HPLMN) country.

When a call originates in one ISDN/PLMN and terminates in another ISDN/PLMN, and the COLR Supplementary Service is applied, the rules and regulations of the originating network shall apply. If the calling party has a relevant override category, the restriction service will be overridden, and the connected line identity will be presented to the calling party.

In situations where the COLR Supplementary Service is applicable, the served user will receive an indication that the connected line identity is not available due to restriction. This indication is also provided in interworking situations where the connection is not fully supported by sufficient signaling capability, and for international calls where the destination network does not provide the connected line identity.

Overall, the functionality of the COLR Supplementary Service ensures privacy for the connected party, while the override conditions allow for necessary exceptions based on national regulations and specific subscriber categories.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose of the COLR Supplementary Service.

Describe the procedure for conditional reconfiguration execution in a UE as specified in TS 38.331 section 5.3.5.13.4.,"The procedure for conditional reconfiguration execution in a UE involves several steps and conditions as specified in TS 38.331 section 5.3.5.13.4. Firstly, the UE determines applicable cells based on the physical cell identity indicated in the ServingCellConfigCommon within the reconfigurationWithSync. If the RRCReconfiguration includes the masterCellGroup, the UE considers the cell matching the physical cell identity in the masterCellGroup as applicable. Similarly, if the RRCReconfiguration includes the secondaryCellGroup, the UE considers the cell matching the physical cell identity in the secondaryCellGroup as applicable.

Next, the UE handles measId in VarMeasConfig associated with SCG and MCG. If condExecutionCondSCG is configured, the UE considers each measId indicated in condExecutionCondSCG as a measId in VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig. If condExecutionCond is configured, the UE considers each measId indicated in condExecutionCond as a measId in VarMeasConfig associated with either the SCG measConfig or the MCG measConfig, depending on the configuration method.

The UE then evaluates the conditions for event fulfillment. For condEventT1, condEventD1, condEventA3, condEventA4, and condEventA5, the UE checks if the entry conditions for these events are fulfilled for the applicable cell during the corresponding timeToTrigger. If the conditions are met, the event associated with the measId is considered fulfilled. Conversely, if the leaving conditions for these events are met, the event associated with the measId is considered not fulfilled.

Finally, if all events associated with measId(s) within condTriggerConfig for the applicable cell are fulfilled, the UE considers the applicable cell as a triggered cell and initiates the conditional reconfiguration execution as specified in section 5.3.5.13.5. Note that up to two measId can be configured for each condReconfigId, and the conditional reconfiguration events may have different conditions, triggering quantities, time to trigger, and triggering thresholds.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the protocol stacks for both the user plane and control plane in 5G NR, including the main services and functions of each sublayer.","In 5G NR, the protocol stacks for both the user plane and control plane are designed to handle different types of data and signaling. 

For the user plane, the protocol stack includes several sublayers: PDCP, RLC, MAC, and a new AS sublayer. The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) sublayer is responsible for header compression, security, and in-sequence delivery of data packets. The RLC (Radio Link Control) sublayer handles segmentation and reassembly of data packets, error correction through ARQ, and in-sequence delivery. The MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer performs functions such as mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing/demultiplexing of MAC SDUs into/from transport blocks, scheduling information reporting, error correction through HARQ, priority handling between UEs and logical channels, and padding. Additionally, the new AS (Access Stratum) sublayer is introduced above PDCP, which provides services such as mapping between a QoS flow and a data radio bearer, and marking QoS flow ID in both downlink and uplink packets. This new sublayer is applicable for connections to the NextGen Core and is configured for each individual PDU session.

For the control plane, the protocol stack includes PDCP, RLC, MAC sublayers, RRC (Radio Resource Control), and NAS (Non-Access Stratum) control protocol. The PDCP, RLC, and MAC sublayers perform similar functions as in the user plane. The RRC sublayer is responsible for broadcasting system information related to AS and NAS, paging initiated by the core network or RAN, establishment, maintenance, and release of RRC connections, carrier aggregation, dual connectivity, security functions including key management, establishment and maintenance of signaling and data radio bearers, mobility functions such as handover and cell selection/reselection, QoS management, UE measurement reporting, and NAS message transfer. The NAS control protocol handles higher-layer signaling between the UE and the core network.

Overall, these protocol stacks ensure efficient data transmission and robust signaling in 5G NR networks.","The answer should include a detailed description of the protocol stacks for both the user plane and control plane. For the user plane, it should cover the roles of PDCP, RLC, MAC sublayers, and the new AS sublayer, including their main services and functions.

Describe the MBMS user service architecture and its integration with MCData File Distribution as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282.,"The MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) user service architecture offers a set of delivery methods to applications, including the MBMS download delivery method, which is used for the delivery of files over MBMS and provides reliability control through forward-error-correction. The MCData File Distribution capability can utilize the MBMS download delivery method by incorporating the MBMS user service architecture within the MC service-on network architecture. In this setup, the MCData server acts as the content provider.

The MCData server may determine the MBMS broadcast area based on the cell identities of the affiliated group members received over GC1. When the xMB interface is employed, the MCData server uses the xMB mission critical extension to control the Quality of Service (QoS) and the MBMS broadcast area of the MBMS user services. Additionally, the MCData server provides a file delivery manifest over xMB-C, which includes a list of files to be broadcasted, the target completion date for each file, and the number of repetitions.

After the creation or update of an MBMS session, the MBMS user service metadata, which includes delivery and schedule parameters, is returned to the MCData server in the form of a Service Announcement (SA) file. The MCData server then signals this SA file, along with the service ID and the URI of the file to be received, to the targeted MCData clients. It is important to note that the use of the service announcement channel to deliver MBMS user service metadata is not covered in the current specification.","The answer must include an overview of the MBMS user service architecture, the role of the MBMS download delivery method in providing reliability control, how the MCData File Distribution capability utilizes the MBMS download delivery method, the process of determining the MBMS broadcast area, the use of the xMB interface for controlling QoS and broadcast area, the provision of a file delivery manifest, and the signaling of MBMS user service metadata through the SA file."
"Describe the procedure for conducting the NR-DL-TDOA test as specified in TS 37.571, including the key steps and conditions involved.","The NR-DL-TDOA test as specified in TS 37.571 involves two sub-tests: Sub-test 1 with Nsample = 4 and Sub-test 2 with Nsample = 1. Sub-test 2 is conducted only if the UE supports supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED. The test consists of two consecutive time intervals, T1 and T2. During T1, the UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2 and Cell 3, while all three cells transmit PRS during T2. The beginning of T2 is aligned with the first PRS processing window instance containing the PRS resources.

The procedure includes the following key steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in State RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters Connectivity NR, Connected without release On.
2. The SS sends a RESET UE POSITIONING STORED INFORMATION message.
3. Set the parameters according to specified tables and propagation conditions.
4. T1 starts.
5. The SS transmits an LPP REQUEST CAPABILITIES message.
6. The UE responds with an LPP PROVIDE CAPABILITIES message indicating its DL-TDOA capabilities.

10. The SS sends an LPP REQUEST LOCATION INFORMATION message, ensuring the UE receives it 50 ms before the start of T2.
11. The SS sends a Positioning Measurement Gap Activation command.
12. When T1 expires, the SS switches the power setting from T1 to T2.
13. The UE transmits an LPP PROVIDE LOCATION INFORMATION message, including the NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideLocationInformation IE within the response time, and performs RSTD measurements for Cell 2 and Cell 3 with respect to Cell 1.
14. If the UE message includes the ackRequested IE set to TRUE, the SS sends an LPP acknowledgment message.

Describe the synchronization process for transparent and non-transparent services in the context of interworking with PSTN and ISDN networks as per 3GPP TS 29.007 specifications.,"The synchronization process for transparent and non-transparent services in the context of interworking with PSTN and ISDN networks as per 3GPP TS 29.007 specifications is detailed as follows:

For transparent services in PSTN interworking (subclause 9.2.3.4.2):
- At the start of timer T for each allocated traffic channel, circuit 108 to the selected modem associated with the connection is switched from 'OFF' to 'ON', initiating the modem connection establishment. For mobile originated calls, this initiates the auto calling sequence, and after signaling, a calling tone according to V.25 is generated by the modem in the IWF.
- The interchange circuits towards the modem (except CT108) are held in the 'OFF' condition until timer T expires, when they are switched to 'ON'.
- After the expiration of timer T, the information on CT106 and CT109 from the IWF modem is directly mapped to the SB and X bits towards the UE. For TCH/F14.4, the SB and X bits are mapped to the M2 multiframe bits according to 3GPP TS 44.021. The IWF can map CT104 to the data bits sent towards the UE and map data bits received from the UE to CT103.

For non-transparent services in PSTN interworking (subclause 9.2.4.10.2):
- CT108 is turned 'ON' to enable the autocalling/autoanswering function of the selected modem either when the RLP has been established or in parallel to RLP establishment. If CT108 is turned 'ON' in parallel to RLP establishment, the modem connection may be established before the RLP is established. Data received from the transit side during RLP establishment is stored within the L2R buffers until the RLP establishment at the terminating side is finished.
- When the RLP has been established, the information from/to the RLP, including status changes, is mapped by the L2R entity applicable to the particular bearer capability. After signaling, for mobile originated calls, a calling tone according to V.25 is generated by the modem in the IWF.

For transparent services in ISDN interworking (subclause 10.2.3.4.2):
- The synchronization process is similar to the PSTN interworking case. The interchange circuits towards the V.110 ISDN TA function are held in the 'OFF' condition until timer T expires, when they are switched to 'ON'.
- After the expiration of timer T, the information on CT106 and CT109 from the IWF V.110 ISDN TA function is directly mapped to the X and SB bits towards the UE. For TCH/F14.4, the X and SB bits are mapped to the M2 multiframe bits according to 3GPP TS 44.021. Circuit 108 to the selected V.110 ISDN TA function associated with the connection is switched from 'OFF' to 'ON', initiating the synchronization process on the fixed network according to ITU-T Recommendation V.110. The IWF can map CT104 to the data bits sent towards the UE and map data bits received from the UE to CT103.

For non-transparent services in ISDN interworking (subclause 10.2.4.10.4.2):
- The synchronization of the V.110 or V.120 rate adaptation protocol on the ISDN transit network may be performed either after RLP establishment or in parallel to RLP establishment. In case of parallel establishment, data received from the transit side during RLP establishment is stored within the L2R buffers until the RLP establishment at the terminating side is finished.
- When the RLP has been established and frame alignment is recognized, the information from/to the RLP is mapped by the L2R entity applicable to the particular bearer capability.
- For V.110 rate adaptation, the synchronization process involves sending the V.110 frame structure and looking for incoming frame synchronization according to ITU-T Recommendation V.110.
- For V.120 rate adaptation, in Multiple frame acknowledged mode, data (I frames) may be sent following an exchange of SABME and UA in the traffic channel. In Unacknowledged mode, data (UI frames) may be sent immediately after an ISUP CONNECT or CONNECT COMPLETE message is received on the ISDN signaling channel. Optionally, an XID exchange may take place in the traffic channel to verify link integrity. V.120 allows UI frames to be sent in Multiple frame acknowledged mode at any time in addition to I frames. The IWF should deliver the contents of the sequence of I and UI frames to the UE in the order received.
- For PIAFS rate adaptation, data frames are sent following an exchange of initial negotiation and control frames in the traffic channel.

In summary, the synchronization processes for both transparent and non-transparent services in PSTN and ISDN interworking involve specific procedures for timer T, CT108, CT106, CT109, SB and X bits mapping, modem connection establishment, RLP establishment, L2R buffers, and various rate adaptation protocols as detailed in the respective subclauses of 3GPP TS 29.007.","The answer should cover the synchronization processes for both transparent and non-transparent services in PSTN and ISDN interworking. It should detail the role of timer T, CT108, CT106, CT109, SB and X bits mapping, modem connection establishment, RLP establishment, L2R buffers, V.110 and V.120 rate adaptation protocols, and PIAFS rate adaptation. Additionally, it should reference the specific subclauses from TS 29.007 that cover these procedures."
"Describe the HARQ process and feedback procedure for relay nodes in 3GPP TS 36.216, focusing on the differences between frame structure types 1 and 2.","In 3GPP TS 36.216, the HARQ process and feedback procedure for relay nodes differ between frame structure types 1 and 2. 

For frame structure type 1, the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) is processed without expecting HARQ feedback on PHICH. Instead, ACK is delivered to higher layers for each transport block transmitted on PUSCH. The number of HARQ processes depends on the subframes configured for eNB-RN transmissions and is determined by the decimal equivalent of the binary number representing the 8-bit bitmap of the parameter SubframeConfigurationFDD, as given by Table 7.3-1. HARQ processes are sequentially assigned to subframes configured for RN-to-eNB transmission.

For frame structure type 2, the number of HARQ processes is given by Table 7.3-2. A re-transmission, when applicable, occurs in a subframe with the same subframe number as the original transmission.

The HARQ-ACK feedback procedure on PUCCH for frame structure type 2 follows Clause 10.1.3 with specific exceptions. For relay nodes configured with HARQ-ACK bundling or PUCCH format 1b with channel selection, the feedback corresponds to subframes defined in Table 7.5.1-1. For relay nodes configured with PUCCH format 3 for HARQ-ACK transmission, if a single PDSCH transmission is received within subframes defined in Table 7.5.1-1, the relay node uses PUCCH format 1/1b to transmit the HARQ-ACK, with the value determined according to higher layer configuration.

The HARQ-ACK feedback procedure on PUSCH for frame structure type 2 follows Clause 7.3 with the exception that the feedback corresponds to subframes defined in Table 7.5.1-1.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how PUSCH is processed for relay nodes, including the lack of HARQ feedback on PHICH.
  - Description of how the number of HARQ processes is determined for frame structure type 1 and type 2.

  - HARQ-ACK feedback procedure on PUSCH for frame structure type 2."
Describe the procedures and roles involved in device triggering and lawful interception in 5G networks as specified in the 3GPP documents.,"In 5G networks, device triggering and lawful interception involve specific procedures and roles as outlined in various 3GPP documents.

For device triggering, the NEFDeviceTriggerReportNotify record is generated by the IRI-POI in the NEF when certain events are detected. These events include the NEF sending a Nnef_Trigger_DeliveryNotify service operation with the GPSI of the target UE to inform the AF about the delivery outcome of the device trigger, and the SM-SC sending a T4 Delivery-Report-Request (DRR) to the NEF with a User-Identifier matching the SUPI of the target UE. This process ensures that the NEF reports the trigger delivery outcome, which could be succeeded, unknown, or failed.

Regarding lawful interception, the LIPF plays the role of the ADMF as defined in the ETSI TS 103 221-1 reference model. The ADMF is responsible for provisioning IRI-POI/IRI-TF/MDF2 and CC-POI/CC-TF/MDF3 to meet the requirements of a warrant. This involves sending ActivateTask and ModifyTask messages with specific delivery types (X2Only for IRI and X3Only for CC) and destinations over LI_X1. When interception needs to cease, the ADMF sends a DeactivateTask message to the relevant functions.

In 5G, device triggering procedures have some differences compared to previous generations. The description of the SCS/AS applies to the AF, the SCEF applies to the NEF, and the HSS applies to the UDM. The NEF interacts with the UDM using the Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement and Nudm_UEContextManagement services. Additionally, the NEF acts as the MTC-IWF, facilitating the interaction between the network elements involved in device triggering.

Overall, these procedures and roles ensure efficient device triggering and lawful interception in 5G networks, adhering to the specified guidelines and requirements.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The conditions under which the NEFDeviceTriggerReportNotify record is generated and the specific events that trigger this generation.
- The role of the LIPF as the ADMF in lawful interception, including the tasks for provisioning and ceasing interception, and the delivery types and destinations for IRI and CC records.
- The differences in device triggering procedures in 5G, including the roles of AF, NEF, UDM, and the interaction between NEF and UDM using Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement and Nudm_UEContextManagement services."
What are the requirements and timing constraints for UE during DAPS handover as specified in TS 36.521 and TS 36.331?,"During DAPS handover, the User Equipment (UE) must adhere to specific requirements and timing constraints as outlined in TS 36.521 and TS 36.331. 

For Dhandover1, the UE must be ready to start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within Dhandover1 seconds from the end of the last Transmission Time Interval (TTI) containing the RRC command. Dhandover1 is calculated as:
Dhandover1 = TRRC_procedure + Tsearch + TIU + 20ms
Where:
- TRRC_procedure is 15 ms, as specified in clause 11.2 of TS 36.331.
- Tsearch is 0 ms in the test, assuming a known cell, defined in clause 5.7.2.1.1.
- TIU is 30 ms in the test, defined in clause 5.7.2.1.1.

During Dhandover1, the UE must be continuously scheduled on Cell 1, and the interruption on Cell 1 must not exceed 1 ms (Tinterrupt1).

For Dhandover2, after a successful RACH procedure of the target cell, when the UE receives an RRC message implying a source cell release command, the UE must accomplish the release actions specified in TS 38.331 within Dhandover2. Dhandover2 is calculated as:
Dhandover2 = TRRC_procedure + Tinterrupt2
Where:
- TRRC_procedure is the maximum RRC procedure delay defined in clause 11.2 of TS 36.331.
- Tinterrupt2 is defined in clause 5.7.2.1.2.

During Dhandover2, the UE is allowed an interruption of up to Tinterrupt2 on the target cell.

The normative reference for these requirements is TS 36.133 clause 5.7.2.1 and A.5.1.56.

Additionally, TS 36.331 specifies the UE performance requirements for RRC procedures. The value N represents the number of 1 ms subframes from the end of reception of the E-UTRAN -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> E-UTRAN response message, excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure, or physical layer synchronization.

"Describe the requirements for general blocking, reference sensitivity, and band categories for multi-standard radio (MSR) base stations as specified in 3GPP TS 37.105 and TS 37.104.","The requirements for general blocking, reference sensitivity, and band categories for multi-standard radio (MSR) base stations are detailed in 3GPP TS 37.105 and TS 37.104. 

General blocking requirements specify that the interfering signal should be a UTRA FDD signal for UTRA, E-UTRA, or NR signals with bandwidths ≤ 20 MHz, and a 20 MHz E-UTRA signal for NR signals with bandwidths > 20 MHz. These requirements apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth, and within sub-block gaps or Inter RF Bandwidth gaps of at least 15 MHz. Performance metrics include:
- For E-UTRA carriers, throughput must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel.
- For UTRA FDD carriers, the BER must not exceed 0.001.
- For UTRA TDD carriers, the BER must not exceed 0.001.
- For NR carriers, throughput must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel.

Reference sensitivity power level (PREFSENS) is defined as the minimum mean power received at the TAB connector at which a reference performance requirement is met for a specified reference measurement channel. Minimum requirements for reference sensitivity are specified for UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR, with NR requirements aligning with those for BS type 1-H.

Band categories for MSR base stations are divided into three categories:
- Band Category 1 (BC1): Bands for NR FDD, E-UTRA FDD, and UTRA FDD operation, also used for NB-IoT.
- Band Category 2 (BC2): Bands for NR FDD, E-UTRA FDD, UTRA FDD, and GSM/EDGE operation, also used for NB-IoT.
- Band Category 3 (BC3): Bands for NR TDD, E-UTRA TDD, and UTRA TDD operation, also used for NB-IoT.

These categories include paired and unpaired bands, with specific requirements for multi-band operation and carrier aggregation. For example, E-UTRA operates with carrier aggregation bands defined in TS 36.101, and NR BS channel bandwidth and PRB utilization are specified in TS 38.104.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"How is the transmission bandwidth configuration for SAN channels determined according to 3GPP specifications, and what are the requirements for guard bands and common resource blocks?","The transmission bandwidth configuration for SAN channels is determined by several key requirements outlined in 3GPP specifications. Firstly, the SAN transmission bandwidth configuration must fulfill the minimum guard band requirement specified in TS 38.108 clause 5.3.3. This minimum guard band for each SAN channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing (SCS) is detailed in table 5.3.3-1 for FR1. The number of resource blocks (RBs) configured in any SAN channel bandwidth must ensure that this minimum guard band is met.

Additionally, the starting point of the transmission bandwidth configuration on the common resource block grid is indicated by an offset to 'Reference point A' in the unit of the numerology. Common resource blocks are numbered from 0 and upwards in the frequency domain for subcarrier spacing configuration, with the center of subcarrier 0 of common resource block 0 coinciding with 'point A'. The relation between the common resource block number in the frequency domain and resource elements for subcarrier spacing configuration is defined relative to point A.

Furthermore, all UE transmission bandwidth configurations indicated to UEs served by the SAN by higher layer parameter carrierBandwidth must fall within the SAN transmission bandwidth configuration. When multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol, the minimum guard band on each side of the carrier is applied at the configured SAN channel bandwidth for the numerology adjacent to the guard band. The inter-numerology guard band within the carrier is implementation dependent.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The requirement for SAN transmission bandwidth configuration to fulfill the minimum guard band as specified in TS 38.108 clause 5.3.3.
  - The starting point of the transmission bandwidth configuration on the common resource block grid, indicated by an offset to 'Reference point A' in the unit of the numerology.
  - The necessity for all UE transmission bandwidth configurations to fall within the SAN transmission bandwidth configuration.
  - The minimum guard band specifications for each SAN channel bandwidth and SCS, as detailed in table 5.3.3-1 for FR1.
  - The configuration of resource blocks to ensure the minimum guard band is met.
  - The numbering and positioning of common resource blocks relative to 'point A' as described in TS 38.211 clause 4.4.4.3."
"Describe the procedure and conditions under which a call control entity checks the call state of its peer entity, including the role of the STATUS ENQUIRY message and timer T322.","The procedure for a call control entity to check the call state of its peer entity involves initiating the status enquiry procedure. This is done by sending a STATUS ENQUIRY message and starting timer T322. The value of timer T322 is implementation dependent in the mobile station (MS) and set by the network operator. While timer T322 is running, the call control entity is prohibited from sending further STATUS ENQUIRY messages.

Upon receipt of a STATUS ENQUIRY message, the receiver must respond with a STATUS message, which reports the current call state and includes cause value #30, 'response to STATUS ENQUIRY'. The receipt of the STATUS ENQUIRY message does not result in any state change related to the protocol and connection of the receiver.

If a STATUS message containing cause value #30 is received, timer T322 is stopped, and further appropriate actions are taken based on the information in the STATUS message relative to the current state of the receiver. These actions are implementation dependent but must adhere to the guidelines prescribed in subclause 5.5.3.2.

If a clearing message is received while timer T322 is running, the timer is stopped, and call clearing continues. If timer T322 expires, the STATUS ENQUIRY message may be retransmitted once. If timer T322 expires again after the maximum number of retransmissions, call clearing is initiated with cause value #41, 'temporary failure', in the first call clearing message.

"What are the performance criteria for communication links during tests as specified in TS 34.124, subclause 6.1, and how do these criteria apply in different modes and scenarios?","The performance criteria for communication links during tests as specified in TS 34.124, subclause 6.1, include several key requirements. Firstly, a communication link must be established at the start of the test and maintained throughout its duration. In data transfer mode, the performance criteria can be based on either the Bit Error Ratio (BER) or the Block Error Ratio (BLER). If BER is used, it must not exceed 0.001 during the test sequence, and if BLER is used, it must not exceed 0.01 during the test sequence.

In speech mode, the performance criteria require that the up link and downlink speech output levels be at least 35 dB less than the recorded reference levels when measured through an audio band pass filter of width 200 Hz, centered on 1 kHz. If there is high-level background noise, the filter bandwidth can be reduced to a minimum of 40 Hz.

At the conclusion of the test, the Equipment Under Test (EUT) must operate as intended with no loss of user control functions or stored data, and the communication link must have been maintained. Additionally, the test must be performed in idle mode to ensure that the transmitter does not unintentionally operate.

Subclauses 9.2.3 and 9.5.3 confirm that the performance criteria outlined in subclause 6.1 apply in their respective contexts, reinforcing the importance of these criteria across different test scenarios.","The answer must include:
  - The necessity of establishing and maintaining a communication link during the test.

Describe the key differences in RRC protocol functionalities and procedures between standard E-UTRAN and NB-IoT as specified in TS 36.331.,"The key differences in RRC protocol functionalities and procedures between standard E-UTRAN and NB-IoT are primarily centered around the reduced set of functionalities supported by NB-IoT. 

Firstly, NB-IoT does not support several features that are available in standard E-UTRAN. These unsupported features include:
- Connected mode mobility (Handover and measurement reporting)
- Inter-RAT cell reselection or inter-RAT mobility in connected mode
- RRC_INACTIVE state
- Closed Subscriber Group (CSG)
- Relay Node (RN)
- Carrier Aggregation (CA)
- Dual connectivity (DC)
- Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC)
- PDCP duplication
- Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) Quality of Service (QoS)
- Access Class Barring (ACB), Extended Access Barring (EAB), Service Specific Access Control (SSAC), and Application Specific Congestion Control (ACDC)
- Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), except for MBMS via Single Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SC-PTM) in Idle mode
- Measurement logging and reporting for network performance optimization
- Public warning systems such as CMAS, ETWS, and PWS
- Broadcast of positioning assistance data
- Real-time services, including emergency calls
- Circuit Switched (CS) services and CS fallback
- In-device coexistence
- Radio Access Network (RAN) assisted WLAN interworking
- Network-assisted interference cancellation/suppression
- Sidelink communication and discovery

The RRC protocol model and services provided to upper layers and expected from lower layers are detailed in TS 36.331, clauses 4.2 and 4.3. These clauses describe the structure and interactions of the RRC protocol with other layers, ensuring efficient communication and resource management.

The main functions of the RRC protocol, as outlined in clause 4.4, include broadcasting system information, RRC connection control, RRC connection mobility, radio configuration control, QoS control, recovery from radio link failure, inter-RAT mobility, measurement configuration and reporting, and other miscellaneous functions. However, many of these functions are not applicable to NB-IoT. For example, NB-IoT does not support ETWS and CMAS notifications, QoS control, inter-RAT mobility, measurement configuration and reporting, self-configuration and self-optimization, and measurement logging and reporting for network performance optimization.

In summary, while standard E-UTRAN supports a wide range of features and procedures to ensure robust and flexible communication, NB-IoT focuses on a simplified set of functionalities tailored for low-power, wide-area applications, excluding many advanced features and procedures found in standard E-UTRAN.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"What are the spurious emission limits for IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitters in FR1, and how do these limits differ for IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O?","The spurious emission limits for IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitters in FR1 are defined in several clauses. Clause 6.6.4 outlines the general operating band unwanted emissions limits. According to clause 6.6.5.2.1, the basic limits for spurious emissions in FR1 are divided into Category A and Category B limits. Table 6.6.5.2.1-1 specifies the general IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitter spurious emission limits in FR1 for Category A, while Table 6.6.5.2.1-2 specifies the limits for Category B. The application of either Category A or Category B limits follows the same guidelines as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.

For IAB-DU type 1-O, the Tx spurious emissions requirements are that for each applicable basic limit above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the basic limit + 9 dB, unless stated differently in regional regulation. For IAB-MT type 1-O, the Tx spurious emissions requirements are that for each applicable basic limit above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the basic limit + 10log10(NTXU,countedpercell) dB, unless stated differently in regional regulation.","The answer should include the following key details:

"What are the minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements on secondary component carriers as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521, and how do these requirements relate to 3GPP TS 36.133?","The minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements on secondary component carriers as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 include several key aspects. Firstly, when no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is in use, the UE must be able to identify a new detectable Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or Time Division Duplex (TDD) cell on the secondary component carrier within a time period defined as Tidentify_scc, which is calculated as 20 times the parameter measCycleSCell. A cell is considered detectable when certain Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) conditions specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1 are met for the corresponding band, and when specific conditions related to Synchronization Channel (SCH) power and interference are fulfilled according to Annex I.2.7.

The measurement period for deactivated secondary cell (SCell) measurements is defined as Tmeasure_scc, which is 5 times the parameter measCycleSCell. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) measurements for up to 8 identified cells on the secondary component carrier and report these measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of Tmeasure_scc. The measurement accuracy for all measured cells must comply with the specifications in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.11, which covers carrier aggregation measurement accuracy.

Additionally, the UE may reconfigure the receiver bandwidth or turn on/off one of the RF chains when performing measurements on one or two secondary component carriers with deactivated SCells. This reconfiguration may cause interruptions on the primary cell (PCell) or an activated SCell, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.8.

Event triggered measurement reports must meet the requirements outlined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9. The UE should not send any event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled. The measurement reporting delay, defined as the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface, must be less than Tidentify_scc as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.1, excluding delays caused by other Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling on the Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) and delay uncertainties related to the Transmission Time Interval (TTI) of the uplink DCCH.

If a cell that has been detectable for at least the time period Tidentify_scc becomes undetectable for a period of 5 seconds or less and then becomes detectable again, triggering an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than Tmeasure_scc, provided the timing to that cell has not changed by more than 50 Ts and the Layer 3 (L3) filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

These requirements are normatively referenced and supported by 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.8, 8.3.3.2.1, and 9.1.","The answer should include the minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements on secondary component carriers as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521. It should detail the conditions under which a cell is considered detectable, the measurement periods for deactivated SCell measurements, the measurement accuracy requirements, and the event triggered measurement reporting delay. Additionally, the answer should explain how these requirements are referenced and supported by 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.8, 8.3.3.2.1, and 9.1."
"Explain the S-NAPTR procedure for MME/SGSN finding the MSC Sv service and interfaces serving the target Routing Area in SRVCC operations towards UTRAN and GERAN, including the construction of the RAI FQDN.","The S-NAPTR procedure for an MME/SGSN to find the MSC Sv service and interfaces serving the target Routing Area in SRVCC operations towards UTRAN and GERAN begins with the 'Service Parameters' of 'x-3gpp-msc:x-sv'. This procedure is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 and involves setting the Application-Unique String to the RAI FQDN based on RAC, LAC, MNC, and MCC. The RAI FQDN is constructed as follows: rac<RAC>.lac<LAC>.rac.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org. Here, <RAC> and <LAC> are hex-coded digits representing the RAC and LAC codes, respectively. If there are fewer than four significant digits in <RAC> or <LAC>, '0' digits are inserted at the left side to fill the four-digit coding.

If the RAC is not available from the information in the Target ID, the MME/SGSN shall set the RAC to a default value, such as the hexadecimal value 'FF'. Operators must provision NAPTR records under the RAI FQDN for each RAI value in their network, corresponding to each valid MSC interface from at least the 'Service Parameters' of 'x-3gpp-msc:x-sv'. Additional 'Service Parameters' may be included optionally.

Provisioning considerations include the option to provision the NAPTR record at the RAI FQDN to correspond only to the default MSC server node(s) in the MSC pool(s) serving that RAI. This results in all SRVCC PS to CS service requests being handled by the default MSC server nodes. To avoid load on the default MSC server nodes, the records provisioned at the RAI FQDN should include the entire set of MSC servers in all MSC server pools that service that RAI. The S-NAPTR procedure would then return each MSC server in the MSC server pool based on the provisioned DNS weights and priority. Additionally, the MSC server closest to the geographical region covered by the RAI can be biased by provisioning the DNS records with higher priority or weights.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The S-NAPTR procedure for MME/SGSN finding the MSC Sv service and interfaces serving the target Routing Area.
  - The service parameters used in the procedure ('x-3gpp-msc:x-sv').
  - The construction of the RAI FQDN based on RAC, LAC, MNC, MCC, including hex coding and padding.
  - The default value for RAC if not available.

The test setup includes one active cell (Cell 1) and one neighbor cell (Cell 2), and it consists of two successive time periods, T1 and T2.

1. **Initial Setup**: Ensure the User Equipment (UE) is in State 3A-RF according to the specified clause. Cell 1 is set as the active cell.
2. **Parameter Settings for T1**: Set the parameters according to T1 as defined in the relevant table. Propagation conditions are set according to the specified annex.
3. **Message Transmission**: The Serving System (SS) transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including conditionalReconfiguration. The UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
4. **Switching Power Settings**: When T1 expires, the SS switches the power setting from T1 to T2 as specified.
5. **Conditional Handover**: The UE executes the conditional handover triggered by Event A3 and sends another RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
6. **Handover Delay Measurement**: If the UE transmits the uplink PRACH channel to Cell 2 within 3900 ms from the start of T2, the test is considered successful. Otherwise, it is marked as a failure.
7. **Post-Handover Actions**: Cause UE handover back to Cell 1 or switch off the UE. Ensure the UE is back in State 3A-RF with Cell 1 as the active cell.
8. **Iteration**: Adjust Cell 2's physical cell identity for the next iteration and repeat the steps until the required confidence level is achieved.

**Handover Delay Calculation**: The handover delay is calculated as the sum of several components:
- TRRC (15 ms)
- Tmeasure (3840 ms)
- TCHO_execution (10 ms)
- Tinterrupt (50 ms)

"Describe the procedures and configurations necessary for EAS registration, including the roles of EASID and EES address.","The EASID is a globally unique identifier that identifies a particular application, such as SA6Video or SA6Game. All instances of a specific application will share the same EASID. The definition of EASID itself is out of scope for the specification.

For EAS registration, the following procedures are supported:
- EAS registration procedure;
- EAS registration update procedure; and
- EAS de-registration procedure.

Before initiating the EAS registration procedure, certain pre-conditions must be met, including the configuration of the EASID and EES address. A consumer, such as an Application Service Provider (ASP) or an Enterprise Communication Service Provider (ECSP), requests the ECSP management system to configure these attributes in the EASFunction IOC. The ECSP management system then configures the EASID and EES address attributes in the EASFunction MOI and returns an attribute change notification to the consumer.

The detailed procedure for configuring the EASID and EES address involves the following steps:
1. The consumer uses the provisioning MnS with the modifyMOIAttributes operation to configure the EASID and EES address.
2. The ECSP management system returns notifyMOIAttributes to inform the consumer that the attributes have been changed.

This interaction ensures that the necessary configurations are in place for the EAS registration procedure to proceed smoothly.","The answer should include the definition of EASID and its role in identifying applications.

"Describe the session establishment process for a PSS client, including the supported formats for initial session descriptions and the recommendations for NAT traversal. Additionally, explain the initiation mechanisms for MBMS user services.","The session establishment process for a Packet Switched Streaming Service (PSS) client involves obtaining the initial session description, which can be a presentation description, a scene description, or simply a URL to the content. The PSS client must support initial session descriptions in formats such as SDP or plain RTSP URL. Additionally, the client should support URLs starting with file:// for locally stored files and http:// for descriptions delivered via HTTP. Valid inputs to a PSS client include URLs like rtsp://example.com/morning_news. These URLs can be made available to the PSS client in various ways, such as embedding them within HTML or WML pages, which browser applications can download and pass to the PSS client for processing. The PSS client should also support progressive download of 3GP files delivered via HTTP or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP.

For NAT traversal, recommendations include using techniques to open the required UDP ports or setting up different transport for streaming media, as not all NATs provide an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for RTSP services.

Regarding the initiation mechanisms for Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) user services, the process involves setting up the reception of MBMS user service data via a UMTS/EPS Bearer Service with interactive and/or streaming traffic class.

Describe the impact of phase offset and correlation on the performance of MSRD receivers in multi-interferer scenarios as discussed in 3GPP TS 45.912.,"The performance of MSRD (Mobile Station Receiver Diversity) receivers in multi-interferer scenarios is influenced by both phase offset and correlation factors. The single input-dual output model is extended to multi-interferer scenarios by using instances of the single input dual output channel model to instantiate interfering signals. After summation of the interfering signals and the desired signal, an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) signal is added to the received signal at each antenna to model the internal noise of the receiver, and gain scaling is applied to model the difference in antenna gains.

Phase offset between signals received at the two antennas in the MS can originate from different antenna spacing and/or angle of arrival in a line of sight scenario. Simulations have shown that applying a random phase offset in one of the antenna branches impacts BER (Bit Error Rate) performance differently depending on the correlation values. For co-channel interference, the largest impact of the phase offset is 0.5 dB for correlation values between 0 and 0.8, and a gain of 1 to 2.5 dB for correlations of 0.9 and 1.0. For adjacent channel interference, the largest impact is 0.4 dB for correlation values between 0 and 0.9, and a gain of 1 dB for a correlation of 1.0. Sensitivity scenarios showed no impact from the phase offset.

Receiver performance is significantly dependent on the phase difference of correlation factors, especially for high correlation values. For a correlation factor of 1.0 and a phase difference of 0 degrees, no interference can be cancelled, whereas for a phase difference of 180 degrees, interference can be cancelled perfectly. The phase angle of the correlation factors should be considered for envelope correlation factors above 0.7.

Performance plots for MSRD receivers as a function of correlation in the desired and interferer branches show relatively constant performance across the surface, except when the correlation is close to one. At this point, performance becomes similar to that of a single branch receiver with SAIC (Single Antenna Interference Cancellation). Applying the same correlation in desired and interferer branches results in average to worst-case performance.

Additionally, the impact of antenna correlation and gain imbalance on performance was studied for GERAN configuration 2 scenarios. The performance obtained when applying a correlation coefficient of 0.7 and a gain imbalance of 3 dB showed variations in uncoded BER and BLER (Block Error Rate) for different modulation schemes and coding rates.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The extension of the single input-dual output model to multi-interferer scenarios, including the addition of AWGN and gain scaling.
  - The impact of phase offset on BER performance in sensitivity limited, DTS-1, and DTS-2 scenarios, with specific results for co-channel and adjacent channel performance.
  - The dependency of receiver performance on the phase difference of correlation factors, particularly for high correlation values.
  - The performance of MSRD receivers as a function of correlation in the desired and interferer branches, highlighting the relatively constant performance except for very high correlations.
  - The impact of antenna correlation and gain imbalance on performance in GERAN configuration 2 scenarios."
"Describe the online charging process for voice calls in the VCS, including the types of chargeable events, the messages exchanged between the Proxy Function and the OCS, and the failure handling mechanisms.","The online charging process for voice calls in the Voice Call Service (VCS) involves several key components and mechanisms, primarily managed by the Proxy Function and the Online Charging System (OCS). The Proxy Function is responsible for initiating and managing the online charging process, while the OCS assigns quotas and authorizes service usage.

The types of chargeable events for voice calls in the VCS include:
1. **Voice call attempt**: An initial Debit/Reserve Units Request message is sent to the OCS to authorize the voice call attempt and request a quota.
2. **Voice call answered**: Depending on operator configuration, quota deduction begins, and the start of charging time is saved.
3. **Voice call not answered (MO/MF)**: A terminate Debit/Reserve Units Request message is triggered, indicating the end of the voice call.
4. **Voice call not answered and conditionally forwarded (MT)**: An update Debit/Reserve Units Request message is triggered, and the start of charging time is provided with the used service units.
5. **Voice call not answered and not conditionally forwarded (MT)**: A termination Debit/Reserve Units Request message is triggered, indicating the end of the voice call.
6. **End of voice call**: A terminate Debit/Reserve Units Request message is sent to the OCS with the final counts.
7. **Ro specific chargeable events**: An update Debit/Reserve Units Request message is triggered according to predefined rules.
8. **Change of charging condition**: An update Debit and Reserve Units Request message is sent when user location changes or other conditions are met.
9. **Tariff time change**: Current counts are captured and sent to the OCS in the next Debit and Reserve Units Request message.

The messages exchanged between the Proxy Function and the OCS include:
- **Debit/Reserve Units Request**: Sent by the Proxy Function to request authorization and quota from the OCS.
- **Debit/Reserve Units Response**: Sent by the OCS to assign quotas and instruct the Proxy Function on whether to continue or terminate the voice call.

Configuration options for determining the start of charging include:
- Charging can start at call attempt, called party alerting, or called party answer, based on operator configuration.

Failure handling mechanisms and actions supported include:
1. **Terminate**: The online session is finished, and the associated voice call is terminated or not established.
2. **Retry&Terminate**: The online session is finished, and the associated voice call is terminated or not established, with failover supported for ongoing calls.
3. **Continue**: The online session is finished, and the associated voice call is established or not terminated, with failover supported for ongoing calls.

Non-applicable capabilities for VCS charging include:
- Credit pooling
- Envelope reporting
- Online control of offline charging information
- Support of multiple services

The relationship between VCS chargeable events and CAMEL events is also significant, as the OCS may use CAMEL procedures to add online charging session-specific information to the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Mobile Switching Center (MSC).

Overall, the VCS online charging process is a comprehensive system designed to manage and authorize voice call charges efficiently, ensuring proper quota assignment and handling various chargeable events and failure scenarios.","The answer must include:

"Describe the procedures for initiating an IMS-based MBMS Download Session, including file repair and reception reporting.","The procedures for initiating an IMS-based MBMS Download Session, including file repair and reception reporting, are as follows:

1. **Initial SIP INVITE Message Generation**: The User Equipment (UE) generates an initial SIP INVITE message and sends it to the Service Control Function (SCF), indicating the chosen MBMS Download Service. This message includes a Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer.

2. **Examination of SDP Parameters**: Upon receiving the SIP INVITE, the SCF examines the SDP parameters in the SDP offer. If the examination is successful, the SCF responds with a SIP 200 OK message, which includes the SDP answer.

3. **Data Reception Using FLUTE**: The UE receives the MBMS download data using the File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) protocol.

4. **File Repair Procedures**: In case of an incomplete download, the following steps are executed to initiate a file repair session:
   - **Step 6a**: The UE initiates the file repair session and tears down the MBMS download session by sending a SIP Re-INVITE message to the IP Multimedia Core Network (IM CN) subsystem.
   - **Step 6b**: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to the SCF.
   - **Step 6c**: The SCF verifies the user rights for the requested file repair service, selects an HTTP/SIP adapter, and forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to the HTTP/SIP adapter. The SCF also tears down the FLUTE-based MBMS download session between the Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BMSC) User Plane Function (UPF) and the UE.
   - **Step 6d**: The HTTP/SIP adapter selects an HTTP server for the file repair service and sends an HTTP POST message to the HTTP server, including the IP address of the UE.
   - **Step 6e**: The HTTP server responds to the HTTP/SIP adapter with an HTTP 200 OK response.
   - **Step 6f**: The HTTP/SIP adapter sends the SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF, including the URI of the file repair server in the SDP answer.
   - **Step 6g**: The SCF forwards the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem.
   - **Step 6h**: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
   - **Step 6i**: The UE leaves the multicast channel and sends HTTP requests to the URI obtained from the SIP 200 OK message to execute file repair procedures. The HTTP server delivers the requested content files for file repair in the HTTP responses to the UE.

5. **Reception Reporting**: The UE reports the reception statistics using either HTTP or SIP INFO messages.

What are the intermodulation requirements and measurement procedures for repeaters as specified in 3GPP TS 36.106 and TS 36.143?,"The intermodulation requirements and measurement procedures for repeaters are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.106 and TS 36.143. According to TS 36.106 sub-clause 11.1.1, the power in the pass band should not increase by more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater when measured at the center of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals applied. The frequency separation between the two interfering signals must be adjusted so that the 3rd order intermodulation product is positioned in the center of the pass band. Table 11.1.1-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, including the f1 offset, which is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first or last channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.

1. **ESM Uplink Message Transmission Failure**:
   - If lower layers indicate a TAI change and the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the ESM procedure is aborted and re-initiated after a successful tracking area updating procedure.
   - If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, or if the TAI has not changed, the re-initiation of the ESM procedure is up to the UE implementation.
   - Typically, the ESM procedure can be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism with a new sequence number and message authentication code, avoiding the restart of the whole procedure.
   - The ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message is not subjected to transmission failure due to handover.

2. **Transmission Failure of ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT Message**:
   - If the UE receives any ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST messages during the attach procedure, the re-initiation of the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is up to the UE implementation.
   - The procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism with new sequence number and message authentication code information.

3. **Collision of UE Requested Bearer Resource Modification Procedure and EPS Bearer Context Modification Procedure**:
   - If the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the UE shall abort the modification procedure, enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE, and proceed with the EPS bearer context modification procedure.

4. **Expiry of Timer T3481**:
   - On the first expiry of timer T3481, the UE resends the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST and restarts the timer. This retransmission is repeated four times. On the fifth expiry, the UE aborts the procedure, releases the PTI, and enters the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

"Describe the procedures and requirements for handling announcements, busy conditions, alternative ring tones, and communication progress information in 3GPP TS 24.628.","In 3GPP TS 24.628, various procedures and requirements are outlined for handling announcements, busy conditions, alternative ring tones, and communication progress information. 

For announcements, services may need to send audio or video announcements to explain the reason for rejecting a communication request or to report the progress of a communication request. The common procedures for announcements are described in subclause 4.2, and examples of signalling flows for some announcement scenarios are provided in Annex A. Additionally, services may provide an alternative ring tone to override local ring tones provided by the User Equipment (UE) as described in subclause 4.3.

Regarding busy conditions, services such as Communication Forwarding on Busy can be triggered by a user's busy condition, which may be determined by the network (Network Determine User Busy, NDUB) or by the user (User Determine User Busy, UDUB). The network determine user busy common procedure is detailed in subclause 4.4, with examples of signalling flows for busy scenarios provided in Annex B. Deployment of some services may require support for optional service requirements for NDUB and approaching NDUB, as defined in TS 181 005. This involves deploying a network function/application server to track a user's busy condition status from the network's perspective.

For alternative ring tones, a service may use the Alert-Info header field as specified by IETF RFC 3261 to provide an alternative ring tone that overrides local ring tones provided by the UE. It is recommended that the size of the referenced alternative ring tone be small to avoid delaying communication establishment.

Communication progress information procedures are specified in subclause 4.7.2.1. Certain services require the usage of the Alert-Info, Call-Info, and Error-Info header fields according to procedures specified by IETF RFC 3261. If the UE detects in-band information received from the network as early media, this information shall override locally generated communication progress information. The UE shall not generate locally generated communication progress information if an early dialog exists where the last received P-Early-Media header field contains 'sendrecv' or 'sendonly'. If an early dialog exists where a SIP 180 response to the SIP INVITE request was received, and no early dialog exists where the last received P-Early-Media header field contained 'sendrecv' or 'sendonly', and in-band information is not received from the network, then the UE is expected to render the locally generated communication progress information.

Additionally, if the UE supports the P-Early-Media header field and has received at least one such header field on at least one early dialog, the UE shall send any available user-generated media on media streams associated with the early dialog where the most recent P-Early-Media header field contained a 'sendrecv' header field value. If the UE receives a re-INVITE request containing no SDP offer, the UE shall send a 200 (OK) response containing an SDP offer indicating the directionality used by the UE as 'sendonly' if the communication session has been put on hold, and 'sendrecv' otherwise. During established communication, if a video stream is provided with a media level attribute 'a=sendonly' and 'a=content: g.3gpp.announcement-no-confirmation', the UE should play this video stream without confirmation with the user if allowed based on the UE's local policy.","The answer must include details on the types of announcements and their procedures, the role of alternative ring tones and their implementation, the distinction between network determined and user determined busy conditions, the fallback procedures for REFER requests, the requirements for network determined user busy, the handling of in-band information and early dialogs, the usage of P-Early-Media header fields, and the handling of re-INVITE requests and video streams without user confirmation."
"Describe the procedure for unsubscribing from all subscribed events for an existing TSC AF application session context, including the steps involved and the possible responses from the TSCTSF.","The procedure for unsubscribing from all subscribed events for an existing TSC AF application session context involves the following steps:

1. **Initiation by NF Service Consumer**: The NF service consumer decides to unsubscribe from all subscribed events for the existing TSC application session context. To do this, the NF service consumer invokes the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Unsubscribe service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request message to the resource URI representing the 'Events Subscription' sub-resource in the TSCTSF.

2. **Reception and Decision by TSCTSF**: Upon receiving the HTTP DELETE request message, the TSCTSF evaluates whether the request is accepted. 

3. **Accepted Request**: If the HTTP DELETE request is accepted, the TSCTSF deletes the 'Events Subscription' sub-resource and sends an HTTP '204 No Content' response message to the NF service consumer. Additionally, the TSCTSF may delete the existing subscription to event notifications for the related PDU session from the PCF.

4. **Rejected Request**: If the HTTP DELETE request is not accepted, the TSCTSF indicates the cause for rejection in the response to the HTTP DELETE request, as specified in clause 6.2.7.

5. **Redirected Request**: If the TSCTSF determines that the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, it sends an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500.

"Describe the test tolerances and environmental conditions specified in TS 25.143 for repeater output power and emission mask values, including how these tolerances and conditions affect the test requirements.","The test tolerances defined in TS 25.143 are derived from test system uncertainties, regulatory requirements, and the criticality to system performance. These tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in the specification to derive the test requirements. Test tolerances may sometimes be set to zero, meaning the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. However, when the test tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements. The formula used for this relaxation is provided in Table B.1 of Annex B.

Environmental conditions for testing are specified in TS 25.143, including normal and extreme test environments. For a normal test environment, the test should be performed within the limits of barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity as stated in Table 5.3. If these conditions cannot be maintained, the actual values must be recorded in the test report. Vibration conditions for tests require the equipment to be subjected to a vibration sequence defined by the manufacturer, using environmental test equipment conforming to IEC 60 068-2-6. Other environmental conditions must be within the specified ranges.

Repeater maximum output power limits are specified under both normal and extreme conditions. Under normal conditions, as defined in section 5.4.1, the repeater output power must remain within the limits specified in Table 6.1. Under extreme conditions, as defined in sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.4, the output power must remain within the limits specified in Table 6.2. In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may also apply to some conditions outside the ranges defined for the normal test environment.

Emission mask values are specified for different repeater output power levels in Tables 9.5 to 9.8. Additional requirements for specific bands are provided in Tables 9.8A, 9.8B, and 9.8C. If the test requirement differs from the minimum requirement, the test tolerance applied is non-zero, as defined in subclause 5.2. The explanation of how the minimum requirement has been relaxed by the test tolerance is given in Annex B.

Overall, the test requirements in TS 25.143 are derived by relaxing the minimum requirements using the test tolerances defined in subclause 5.2. The derivation process and the formula used for this relaxation are detailed in Table B.1 of Annex B.","The answer should cover the definition and purpose of test tolerances, including their derivation and the conditions under which they may be set to zero. It should explain the environmental conditions specified for normal and extreme test environments, including barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, and vibration conditions. The answer should detail the repeater maximum output power limits under both normal and extreme conditions, referencing the relevant sections and tables. It should also describe the emission mask values for different output power levels and additional requirements for specific bands. Finally, the answer should explain how test requirements are derived by relaxing minimum requirements using test tolerances, including the formula provided in Table B.1."
Explain the usage and significance of the MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute and the alternative tmgi declaration attribute in MBMS User Services.,"The MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute and the alternative tmgi declaration attribute play crucial roles in the delivery and management of MBMS User Services.

The MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute is defined to specify the mode of MBMS bearer used in session descriptions. It can be declared at the session level if all media declarations use MBMS broadcast mode or broadcast-mbsfn mode. The syntax for this attribute is 'a=mbms-mode:' followed by either 'broadcast' or 'broadcast-mbsfn', a Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI), and optionally MBMS Counting Information. The TMGI is a unique identifier constructed from the MBMS Service ID, MCC, and MNC, encoded as a decimal number. The MBMS Counting Information indicates whether RAN level counting procedures are applicable, with '0' for not counting and '1' for counting.

The alternative tmgi declaration attribute is used at the session level to list multiple TMGIs when the content of an MBMS User Service is delivered simultaneously in multiple PLMN areas over different MBMS bearer service instances. The syntax for this attribute is 'a=alternative-tmgi:' followed by a list of TMGIs. This attribute helps the User Equipment (UE) determine service availability by matching its current location's TMGI with the listed TMGIs. It is optional and complements the MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute, which remains the default TMGI.

In scenarios where FLUTE session parameters are the same but distributed over different MBMS bearers, the alternative-tmgi attribute is used. If the FLUTE session parameters differ, the userServiceDescription element signals the applicable delivery methods based on geographical areas or delivers the session description file over unicast.

The MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute is also specifically used for MBMS streaming sessions, ensuring consistent application across different types of MBMS services.

Overall, these attributes ensure efficient and flexible delivery of MBMS User Services across various geographical areas and network configurations.","The answer should cover the definition and syntax of the MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute, including its application at the session and media levels. It should explain the construction of TMGI and the role of MBMS Counting Information. Additionally, the answer should describe the alternative tmgi declaration attribute, its syntax, and how it is used to list multiple TMGIs for service availability. The explanation should include scenarios where different delivery methods are used and how the alternative-tmgi attribute fits into these scenarios. Finally, the answer should mention the application of the MBMS bearer mode declaration attribute in MBMS streaming sessions."
"Describe the de-registration procedure between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS, including the message formats and result codes involved.","The de-registration procedure between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS is initiated to remove a previous registration and all associated state. This procedure is triggered by the HSS when a subscription needs to be removed. The HSS sends a Deregistration-Reason AVP, which includes a textual message for the user and a reason code that determines the action the 3GPP AAA Server must perform.

The Registration-Termination-Request (RTR) command is used to request the de-registration of a user. It is indicated by the Command-Code field set to 304 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field. The message format for RTR includes mandatory AVPs such as Vendor-Specific-Application-Id, Auth-Session-State, Origin-Host, Origin-Realm, Destination-Host, Destination-Realm, User-Name, and Deregistration-Reason, along with optional AVPs like DRMP and Supported-Features.

The Registration-Termination-Answer (RTA) command is sent by the client in response to the RTR command. It is indicated by the Command-Code field set to 304 and the 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field. The RTA message format includes mandatory AVPs such as Vendor-Specific-Application-Id, Auth-Session-State, Origin-Host, and Origin-Realm, along with optional AVPs like Result-Code, Experimental-Result, DRMP, and Supported-Features.

The possible reason codes for de-registration are:
- PERMANENT_TERMINATION: Indicates that the non-3GPP subscription or service profile(s) has been permanently terminated or Core Network Restrictions do not allow access to EPC anymore. The HSS clears the user's 3GPP AAA Server name and sets the User Status to NOT_REGISTERED. The 3GPP AAA Server should start the network-initiated de-registration towards the user.
- NEW_SERVER_ASSIGNED: Indicates that a new 3GPP AAA Server has been allocated to the user. The 3GPP AAA Server removes all user data and session information for the user indicated in the de-registration request but does not start the network-initiated de-registration towards the user.

Result codes in responses are included in the Experimental-Result AVP, as defined in TS 29.229. When one of these result codes is included in a response, the Result-Code AVP is absent.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose and format of the RTR and RTA commands, including the mandatory and optional AVPs.
  - The role of the HSS in initiating the de-registration procedure and the actions taken by the 3GPP AAA Server.
  - The possible reason codes for de-registration and their implications.
  - The use of Experimental-Result AVP for result codes in responses, as defined in TS 29.229."
"Describe the procedure and API operation for cancelling the location reporting configuration in a 3GPP network, including the information flow and pre-conditions.","The procedure for cancelling the location reporting configuration in a 3GPP network involves several steps and pre-conditions. 

Firstly, the pre-conditions required for cancelling the location reporting triggers configuration are:
1. The location management server must have subscribed the location management client 2 to location reporting event triggers.
2. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used must be activated by the location management server.

The detailed steps of the procedure are as follows:
1. The location management client 1 (which can be an authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL server sends a location reporting configuration cancel request to the location management server (Step 1a). The location management server then forwards this cancel request to the location management client 2 to stop receiving the UE location information (Step 1b). This message can be sent via unicast or multicast. Notably, Step 1b can be initiated without Step 1a.
2. Upon receiving the cancel request, the location management client invalidates the location reporting triggers configuration and ceases to report its location to the location management server.
3. The location management client 2 sends a location reporting configuration cancel response to the location management server (Step 3a) as an acknowledgement. The location management server then sends this response to the location management client 1 (Step 3b) as an acknowledgement.

The API operation used for this procedure is named Cancel_Trigger_Location_Reporting. Its purpose is to cancel the trigger to report location information. The known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server. The inputs and outputs for this API operation are detailed in subclause 9.3.2.8, and the usage of this API operation is further explained in subclause 9.3.6.","The answer must include the following key details:
  - The information flow for the location reporting configuration cancel request as described in Table 9.3.2.8-1.
  - The pre-conditions required for cancelling the location reporting triggers configuration.
  - The detailed steps of the procedure for cancelling the location reporting triggers configuration, including the roles of the location management client 1, location management server, and location management client 2.
  - The API operation name (Cancel_Trigger_Location_Reporting), its purpose, known consumers, and references to the relevant subclauses for inputs and outputs."
"Describe the procedures for releasing a GA-RRC connection between the MS and the GANC, including both network-initiated and MS-initiated scenarios, as well as the CS call clearing process.","The procedures for releasing a GA-RRC connection between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Generic Access Network Controller (GANC) can be categorized into network-initiated and MS-initiated scenarios, along with the CS call clearing process.

1. **Network-Initiated GA-RRC Connection Release:**
   - The Core Network (CN) indicates to the GANC to release the resources allocated to the MS via the RANAP Iu Release Command message.
   - The GANC commands the MS to release resources using the GA-RRC RELEASE message, which includes the CN Domain Identity (CS or PS).
   - The GANC confirms resource release to the CN using the Iu Release Complete message. Optionally, the GANC may wait for the GA-RRC RELEASE COMPLETE message from the MS before sending the Iu Release Complete message to the CN.
   - The MS confirms resource release to the GANC using the GA-RRC RELEASE COMPLETE message, and the GA-RRC state of the CS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity or the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS changes to GA-RRC-IDLE.

2. **MS-Initiated GA-RRC Connection Release:**
   - The MS may initiate CS or PS GA-RRC connection release by sending the GA-RRC RELEASE REQUEST message to the GANC, which includes the CN Domain identity (CS or PS) and the Cause indicating the reason for GA-RRC connection release.
   - Upon receipt of the GA-RRC RELEASE REQUEST from the MS or due to local conditions in the GANC, the GANC initiates Iu release for the particular CN domain by sending the Iu Release Request message to the CN Domain entity.
   - The CN triggers the release of connection as described in the network-initiated procedure.

3. **MS-Initiated CS Call Clearing:**
   - The MS sends the Disconnect message to the CN to release the call, contained in the GA-RRC UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and GANC. The GANC forwards the Disconnect message to the CN using the RANAP Direct Transfer message.
   - The CN responds with a Release message to the GANC, which forwards this message to the MS using the GA-RRC DL DIRECT TRANSFER message.
   - The MS responds with the Release Complete message, contained within the GA-RRC UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and GANC. The GANC forwards the Disconnect message to the CN.
   - The CN triggers the release of connection as described in the network-initiated procedure.

These procedures ensure the orderly release of resources and connections between the MS and the GANC, maintaining efficient network operations and resource management.","The answer should cover the following key points for completeness: 
  - For network-initiated GA-RRC connection release: the sequence of messages (Iu Release Command, GA-RRC RELEASE, Iu Release Complete, GA-RRC RELEASE COMPLETE) and the state change to GA-RRC-IDLE.
  - For MS-initiated GA-RRC connection release: the sequence of messages (GA-RRC RELEASE REQUEST, Iu Release Request) and the inclusion of the CN Domain identity and cause for release.
  - For MS-initiated CS call clearing: the sequence of messages (Disconnect, Release, Release Complete) and the forwarding process between MS, GANC, and CN."
Compare the procedures for initiating an emergency alert between an LMR user and an MC service user as described in 3GPP TS 23.283.,"The procedures for initiating an emergency alert between an LMR user and an MC service user as described in 3GPP TS 23.283 have several similarities and differences.

Pre-conditions:
Both procedures require the MC service group to be previously defined on the group management server with affiliated MC service clients. The IWF must be connected to and authorized to interwork with the MC service system, and the MC service group information must be available at the IWF, including the mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC service system and the LMR system. However, the LMR user procedure specifies that an emergency alert is requested on the LMR system, while the MC service user procedure does not have this specific pre-condition.

Steps involved:
For the LMR user initiating an emergency alert:
1. The LMR user initiates an emergency alert.
2. The IWF sends an IWF emergency alert request to the designated MC service server.
3. The MC service server checks the authorization and affiliation status of the group members.
4. The MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert response to the IWF.
5. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request to the MC service clients of the affiliated group members.
6. MC service users are notified of the emergency.
7. The receiving MC service clients send an MC service emergency alert response to the MC service server.
8. The MC service server affiliates the individual MC service ID of the LMR user to the emergency group if not already affiliated.

For the MC service user initiating an emergency alert:
1. The MC service user initiates an emergency alert.
2. The MC service client sends an MC service emergency alert request to the MC service server.
3. The MC service server resolves the group ID, determines the affiliation status, and checks authorization.
4. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert response to the MC service client.
5. The MC service server sends an IWF emergency alert request to the IWF.
6. The IWF sends an IWF service emergency alert response to the MC service server.
7. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request to the MC service clients of the affiliated group members.
8. MC service users are notified of the emergency.
9. The receiving MC service clients send an MC service emergency alert response to the MC service server.
10. The MC service server affiliates the MC service client to the emergency group if not already affiliated.

Notable differences:
- The LMR user procedure involves the IWF sending the initial emergency alert request, while the MC service user procedure involves the MC service client sending the initial request.
- The LMR user procedure includes a step where the IWF performs identity conversion and protocol translation for all signaling messages, which is noted but not explicitly detailed in the MC service user procedure.
- The handling of location information is specified in both procedures, with the IWF indicating if the location is not available in the LMR user procedure and the MC service server doing the same in the MC service user procedure.

Specific notes:
- Both procedures note that sending an emergency alert without requesting to start an emergency call does not put the group into an ongoing emergency condition.
- The LMR user procedure specifies that the MC service server can affiliate the IWF ID instead of individual MC service IDs if configured to do so.
- Both procedures clarify that sending an emergency alert does not put other UEs in the group into an emergency state.

Overall, while both procedures follow a similar structure, the roles of the IWF and MC service server differ slightly, and specific actions such as identity conversion and protocol translation are emphasized differently.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Pre-conditions for both procedures, highlighting any differences.
  - Detailed steps involved in each procedure, noting the sequence and specific actions taken by the IWF, MC service server, and MC service clients.
  - Any notable differences in how the emergency alert is processed and communicated between the systems.
  - Specific notes that clarify conditions under which certain actions are taken or not taken, such as the handling of location information and affiliation status."
What are the requirements and constraints for a video Adaptation Set in a VR streaming context according to 3GPP TS 26.118?,"According to 3GPP TS 26.118, the requirements and constraints for a video Adaptation Set in a VR streaming context are as follows:

1. **Signaling Conformance**: The @profiles parameter in the Adaptation Set may signal conformance to the Operation Point by using 'urn:3GPP:vrstream:mp:video:basic' if all Representations in the Adaptation Set conform to the specified requirements.

2. **@codecs Parameter**: The @codecs parameter must be present at the Adaptation Set level to signal the maximum required capability to decode any Representation in the Adaptation Set. It should also be signaled at the Representation level if different from the one at the Adaptation Set level.

3. **Resolution Parameters**: The attributes @maxWidth and @maxHeight must be present to signal the original projected source content format, which may exceed the actual largest size of any coded Representation in the Adaptation Set. The @width and @height must be signaled for each Representation and should match the values of the maximum width and height in the Sample Description box of the contained Representation.

4. **Chroma Format**: If signaled, the Chroma Format must use an Essential or Supplemental Descriptor with the @schemeIdURI attribute set to 'urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:MatrixCoefficients' and the @value attribute according to ISO/IEC 23001-8. The values must match those set in the VUI and be signaled at the Adaptation Set level.

5. **Colour Primaries and Transfer Function**: If signaled, these must use an Essential or Supplemental Descriptor with the @schemeIdURI attribute set to 'urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ColourPrimaries' and 'urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:TransferCharacteristics' respectively, and the @value attribute according to ISO/IEC 23001-8. The values must match those set in the VUI and be signaled at the Adaptation Set level only.

6. **Frame Rate**: The @frameRate should be signaled at the Adaptation Set level.

7. **Random Access Points**: These must be signaled by setting the @startsWithSAP attribute to 1 or 2.

8. **Projection Signaling**: A Supplemental Descriptor should be used to signal the projection type by setting the @schemeIdURI attribute to 'urn:mpeg:mpegI:omaf:2017:pf' and the omaf:@projection_type attribute to 0.

9. **Coverage Information**: If the CoverageInformationBox is present, a Supplemental Descriptor should be used to signal the value by setting the @schemeIdURI attribute to 'urn:mpeg:mpegI:omaf:2017:cc' and must match the information provided in the CoverageInformationBox. Specific constraints include the presence of cc@shape_type set to 1, the absence of cc@view_idc_presence_flag, and the presence of exactly one cc.CoverageInfo element with specific attributes.

10. **FramePacking Element**: The FramePacking element must not be present.

11. **Additional DASH Representation Requirements**: For a VR Track included in a DASH Representation, additional constraints apply to various boxes such as the Media Header Box, Movie Header Box, Sample Table Box, Track Header Box, Movie Fragment Header Boxes, and Segment Index Box. These include setting certain fields to '0', sequential numbering of sequence_number values, and ensuring identical coverage information and frame rates across all Representations in an Adaptation Set.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The use of the @profiles parameter to signal conformance to the Operation Point.
- The presence and signaling of the @codecs parameter at both Adaptation Set and Representation levels.
- The requirements for @maxWidth, @maxHeight, @width, and @height parameters.
- The optional signaling of Chroma Format, Colour Primaries, and Transfer Function, including the use of Essential or Supplemental Descriptors.
- The signaling of @frameRate, Random Access Points, and projection type.
- Constraints related to the CoverageInformationBox and the prohibition of the FramePacking element.
- Additional requirements for DASH Representation in a VR Track, including constraints on various boxes (Media Header Box, Movie Header Box, Sample Table Box, Track Header Box, Movie Fragment Header Boxes, Segment Index Box) and the need for identical coverage information and frame rates across all Representations in an Adaptation Set."
Describe the procedures and handling mechanisms for UPF and SMF failures as specified in TS 23.527.,"The procedures and handling mechanisms for UPF and SMF failures as specified in TS 23.527 are as follows:

1. **PSA UPF Failure without Restart**: The procedures for PSA UPF failure without restart are implementation-specific, meaning that the exact steps and methods to handle such failures are determined by the implementation and may vary.

2. **SMF Peer PFCP Entity Failure**: When a UPF detects that a peer PFCP entity in the SMF is not reachable for a preconfigured time, the UPF is required to delete all the session contexts affected by the peer PFCP entity failure that it may have stored. This ensures that any sessions relying on the failed SMF entity are properly cleaned up to avoid inconsistencies.

3. **N4 Path Failures**: 
   - If the N4 path to the UPF is down, the SMF should handle this situation as an UPF Failure without Restart, referring to the procedures outlined in clause 4.3.3.
   - Conversely, if the N4 path to the SMF is down, the UPF should handle this as an SMF Failure without Restart, following the guidelines specified in clause 4.4.3.

These mechanisms ensure that failures in the network components are managed effectively to maintain the integrity and reliability of the network operations.","The answer should include the implementation-specific nature of PSA UPF failure procedures, the requirement for UPF to delete session contexts when a peer PFCP entity in the SMF is not reachable, and the handling of N4 path failures by SMF and UPF as specified in TS 23.527 clauses 4.3.3 and 4.4.3."
Describe the initialization process of GPL-SA for both downlink and uplink traffic in the context of NAF SA as defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 and TS 33.224.,"The initialization process of GPL-SA (Generic Push Layer Security Association) for both downlink and uplink traffic in the context of NAF SA (Network Application Function Security Association) involves several steps as defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 and TS 33.224.

Firstly, NAF SA holds NAF-key(s) and can have unique identities for uplink and downlink references to support unlinkability between uplink and downlink protection measures. The identifiers for NAF SA are:
- DL_SA_Id: Identifies NAF SA in the UE (User Equipment) for downlink traffic.
- UL_SA_Id: Identifies NAF SA in the NAF for uplink traffic.

For downlink GPL-SA initialization, the Push-NAF and UE follow these steps:
- The Push-NAF sets the GPL-SA SAID equal to the NAF SA's DL_SA_Id value.
- The GPL-SA master key is set equal to Ks_NAF or Ks_int_NAF according to the NAF SA.
- The sequence number SN_s is set to 1.
- The life-time of the GPL-SA is set equal to the life-time of the NAF SA.
- The cipher suite and key indication ID are set according to the application's policy.

Similarly, the UE initializes the downlink GPL-SA by:
- Setting the GPL-SA SAID equal to the NAF SA's DL_SA_Id value.
- Setting the GPL-SA master key equal to Ks_NAF or Ks_int_NAF according to the NAF SA.
- Setting the sequence number SN_h to 0.
- Setting the life-time of the GPL-SA equal to the life-time of the NAF SA.

For uplink GPL-SA initialization, the Push-NAF and UE follow these steps:
- The Push-NAF sets the GPL-SA SAID equal to the NAF SA's UL_SA_Id value.
- The GPL-SA master key is set equal to Ks_NAF or Ks_int_NAF according to the NAF SA.
- The sequence number SN_h is set to 0.
- The life-time of the GPL-SA is set equal to the life-time of the NAF SA.

The UE initializes the uplink GPL-SA by:
- Setting the GPL-SA SAID equal to the NAF SA's UL_SA_Id value.
- Setting the GPL-SA master key equal to Ks_NAF or Ks_int_NAF according to the NAF SA.
- Setting the sequence number SN_s to 1.
- Setting the life-time of the GPL-SA equal to the life-time of the NAF SA.
- Setting the cipher suite and key indication ID according to the application's policy.

These steps ensure that the GPL-SA is properly initialized for secure communication between the UE and the Push-NAF, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the transmitted data.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Explanation of NAF SA and its identifiers (DL_SA_Id and UL_SA_Id) as per TS 33.223.
- Detailed steps for initializing downlink GPL-SA by Push-NAF and UE, including SAID, master key, sequence numbers, life-time, and cipher suite as per TS 33.224.

"Describe the session release procedures for an ICS UE attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS, including the different scenarios of release initiation and the corresponding call flows.","The session release procedures for an ICS UE attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS involve several scenarios, each with specific call flows and steps. These scenarios include releases initiated by the ICS UE, the network, and the far end, and can use either the Gm or I1 reference points.

1. **IMS Procedures for Gm Reference Point**:
   When using the Gm reference point, IMS procedures are executed for the release of the service control signalling session as defined in clause 5.10 of TS 23.228. The SCC AS initiates the release of the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path, and the MSC Server releases the CS Session with the ICS UE. After confirmation of the session release from the ICS UE, the MSC Server completes the release of the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path with the SCC AS. The ICS UE may also initiate the release of the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path, and both the SCC AS and ICS UE must handle the case gracefully when both initiate the release procedure.

2. **Session Release Using I1 Reference Point**:
   - **ICS UE Initiated Release**:
     The ICS UE sends a release message over I1 to the SCC AS, which then sends a SIP BYE to the I/S-CSCF serving the ICS UE. The S-CSCF forwards the SIP BYE to UE A, which responds with a SIP OK to the SCC AS via the S-CSCF of UE B. The SCC AS completes the session release procedure by sending a release-ack over I1. If this is the release of the last service control signalling session, the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path is released as described in clause 7.7.1.2.

   - **Network Initiated Release**:
     The S-CSCF decides to terminate the session due to administrative reasons or service expiration. It sends a SIP BYE message to the SCC AS, which then sends a release message over I1 to the ICS UE. The ICS UE responds with a release-ack to the SCC AS over I1, and the SCC AS sends a SIP OK to the I/S-CSCF. Simultaneously, the S-CSCF sends a SIP BYE message to UE A, which acknowledges receipt and sends a SIP OK back to the S-CSCF. If this is the release of the last service control signalling session, the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path is released as described in clause 7.7.1.2.

   - **Far End Initiated Release**:
     UE A terminates the session by sending a SIP BYE via its own S-CSCF towards the I/S-CSCF of ICS UE B. The S-CSCF sends a SIP BYE message to the SCC AS, which then sends a release message over I1 to the ICS UE. The ICS UE responds with a release-ack to the SCC AS over I1, and the SCC AS sends a SIP OK to the I/S-CSCF. The S-CSCF then sends a SIP OK message to UE A. If this is the release of the last service control signalling session, the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path is released as described in clause 7.7.1.2.

In each scenario, the release of the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path is handled appropriately, ensuring a smooth termination of the session.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. Explanation of IMS procedures for releasing service control signalling sessions using Gm reference point.
2. Detailed steps involved in the session release when using Gm or I1, including actions by SCC AS and MSC Server.

Describe the rules and restrictions for DL transmission bursts and uplink PUSCH transmission in E-UTRAN as defined in TS 36.300 and TS 36.321.,"In E-UTRAN, the rules and restrictions for DL transmission bursts and uplink PUSCH transmission are defined in TS 36.300 and TS 36.321. 

For DL transmission bursts, Channel Access Priority Classes (1...4) play a crucial role. When a DL transmission burst with PDSCH is transmitted, for which channel access has been obtained using Channel Access Priority Class P (1...4), E-UTRAN must ensure the following:
- The transmission duration of the DL transmission burst should not exceed the minimum duration needed to transmit all available buffered traffic corresponding to Channel Access Priority Classes ≤ P.
- The transmission duration of the DL transmission burst should not exceed the Maximum Channel Occupancy Time for Channel Access Priority Class P, as defined in Table 4.1.1-1 of TS 37.213.
- Additional traffic corresponding to Channel Access Priority Classes > P may only be included in the DL transmission burst once no more data corresponding to Channel Access Priority Classes ≤ P is available for transmission. In such cases, E-UTRAN should maximize occupancy of the remaining transmission resources in the DL transmission burst with this additional traffic.

For uplink PUSCH transmission, there are no additional restrictions at the UE other than the multiplexing rules defined in clause 5.4.3 of TS 36.321. This means that the type of traffic that can be carried in the scheduled subframes is not further restricted beyond these multiplexing rules.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of Channel Access Priority Classes and their role in DL transmission bursts
  - Conditions under which DL transmission burst duration is determined
  - Definition and importance of Maximum Channel Occupancy Time

Describe the structure and components of the Naanf_AKMA API URI as defined in the 3GPP specifications.,"The Naanf_AKMA API URI is structured according to the guidelines provided in the 3GPP specifications. The complete URI format is: {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>. 

The components of the URI are defined as follows:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts:
  - scheme: Either 'http' or 'https'.
  - the fixed string '://'.
  - authority: This includes the host and optional port, represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
  - an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character.
- <apiName>: For the Naanf_AKMA API, this is set to 'naanf-akma'.
- <apiVersion>: This indicates the major version of the API, which is 'v1' for the Naanf_AKMA API.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clauses 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 of the specification. However, it is important to note that there are no resources defined for the Naanf_AKMA API in the current release.

Additionally, the general guidelines for resource URIs in 5GC SBI APIs specify that a URI uniquely identifies a resource and should not contain a trailing slash. If a trailing slash is present, it should be ignored or removed.

An example of an API URI, following these guidelines, would be: '{apiRoot}/naanf-akma/v1'.","The answer should include the complete structure of the Naanf_AKMA API URI, specifying the values for <apiName> ('naanf-akma') and <apiVersion> ('v1').

"Describe the procedures for transferring positioning related information and O&M data between an SMLC and LMU as defined in TS 43.059, including the reset, status query, and status update procedures.","The procedures for transferring positioning related information and O&M data between a Serving Mobile Location Center (SMLC) and a Location Measurement Unit (LMU) as defined in TS 43.059 are comprehensive and cover various aspects of communication and control. These procedures are applicable to both Circuit Switched (CS) and Packet Switched (PS) domains.

Firstly, the procedures support the transfer of positioning related information and O&M data between an SMLC and a particular LMU associated with the SMLC. These procedures are applicable to any Type A LMU and may also be used for any Type B LMU to enable control of the LMU by its associated SMLC. The procedures assume support for the establishment of a signaling link and the transfer of LLP messages between an SMLC and LMU.

The reset procedure enables an SMLC to return an LMU to a known initial state in which no measurement or O&M operations are outstanding or being performed. The steps involved are:
1. After establishing a signaling connection to the LMU, the SMLC sends an LLP Reset Invoke to the LMU via the Base Station Controller (BSC).
2. The LMU cancels any LCS measurement and O&M tasks previously ordered by the SMLC and returns an LLP Reset Return Result to the SMLC.

The status query procedure allows an SMLC to verify the status of an associated LMU. This procedure can be initiated periodically or following any loss of communication with the LMU. The steps involved are:
1. After establishing a signaling connection to the LMU, the SMLC sends an LLP Status Query Invoke to the LMU via the BSC.
2. The LMU returns an LLP Status Query return result, indicating the number of active measurement jobs for each type of measurement and the number of active O&M jobs in the LMU that were previously ordered by the SMLC.

The status update procedure enables an LMU to report status information to its associated SMLC. This procedure may be instigated periodically, during power-on condition or recovery from failure with loss of memory, impending availability or unavailability for O&M reasons, or location update by a Type A LMU in a new Location Area. The steps involved are:
1. After establishing a signaling connection to the SMLC, the LMU sends an LLP Status Update Invoke to the SMLC via the BSC. This message includes the reason for the status update, the number of active and outstanding jobs of each category in the LMU, and the current hardware status.
2. The SMLC returns an LLP Status Update return result to acknowledge receipt of the status update.

These procedures ensure effective communication and control between the SMLC and LMU, facilitating accurate positioning and efficient O&M operations.","The answer should include the following key details: 
1. Overview of the procedures for transferring positioning related information and O&M data between SMLC and LMU, applicable to both CS and PS domains.
2. Explanation of the applicability of procedures to Type A and Type B LMUs, and the establishment of signaling link and transfer of LLP messages.
3. Detailed steps of the reset procedure, including the sending and receiving of LLP Reset Invoke and Return Result messages.
4. Detailed steps of the status query procedure, including the sending and receiving of LLP Status Query Invoke and Return Result messages.
5. Detailed steps of the status update procedure, including the reasons for instigating the procedure and the sending and receiving of LLP Status Update Invoke and Return Result messages."
"Describe the protocol elements and procedures for facsimile transmission as defined in 3GPP TS 23.146, including interactions between FAs and TAF, and the transcoding process to save transmission capacity.","The protocol elements and procedures for facsimile transmission as defined in 3GPP TS 23.146 include several key components and interactions:

1. **Protocol Elements for Facsimile Transmission**:
   - The protocol elements are based on E-T.38 and are structured as outlined in annex A. The IFP packet is used to relay ITU-T Recommendation T.30 BCS frames and includes the possibility to transmit parts of an entire BCS frame (segmentation).
   - **T.30_INDICATOR** packets include:
     - CNG packet
     - CED packet
     - TCF error detection packet: Used to notify the opposite FA of the TCF error.
     - FA_busy_packet: Used to notify the T-FA that the R-FA has received the image signal from T-FA.
     - FA_non_busy_packet: Used to notify the T-FA that the R-FA has received the MCF, RTP, or PIP frame from R-FAX.
   - **T.30_DATA** packets conform to T.38.

2. **Interactions Between FAs and TAF**:
   - Interactions are necessary to align the content of protocol packets with the capabilities of the supporting UMTS PLMN and to adopt hardware flow control of V.24 for flow control between FA and TAF.
   - FAs at the UE side and at the MSC/IWF side monitor BCS frames and facsimile coded data exchanged between facsimile terminals. They perform actions such as receiving, storing, changing information elements, transcoding, and transmitting BCS frames and FA protocol packets.
   - Necessary interventions with the associated facsimile terminal include controlling half duplex connections, performing phasing/training, transmitting BCS frames autonomously, and adjusting time intervals between transmitted BCS frames and responses.

3. **Transcoding Process to Save Transmission Capacity**:
   - To save transmission capacity at the radio interface, the content of the document is transcoded during normal facsimile data transfer, but not during ITU-T Recommendation T.30 error correction mode.
   - The facsimile coded data received by the T-FA from the T-FAX is transcoded and transmitted to the corresponding R-FA across the radio interface, then transcoded and transmitted to the R-FAX by R-FA.
   - The transcoding is based on the minimum line length capability of the T.30 protocol. The transmitting facsimile terminal must fill up each coded scan line with FILL information to conform to this requirement. The FA associated with the T-FAX forces the use of the standard value of 20 ms by replacing the applicable parameter value of the exchanged DIS/DTC messages. All FILL information is deleted prior to forwarding the data across the radio interface. The FA associated with the R-FAX recognizes and stores the originally requested minimum line length to regenerate the correct line length.
   - ITU-T Recommendation T.4 document coding may be 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, or uncompressed, and the FAs must take care of this when transcoding the document content.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
1. Description of the IFP packet and its components (T.30_INDICATOR and T.30_DATA) as outlined in Document 1.
2. Explanation of the interactions between FAs and TAF, including monitoring and handling BCS frames, flow control, and interventions with the facsimile terminal as described in Document 2.

"Describe the requirements and conditions for UE demodulation and CSI performance in 3GPP TS 38.521, focusing on the different modes and SNR definitions.","The requirements for UE demodulation and CSI performance in 3GPP TS 38.521 are defined under two distinct modes: Mode 1 and Mode 2. 

Mode 1 involves conditions with an external noise source. In this mode, a wanted signal with power level Es is transmitted alongside an external white noise source with power spectral density Noc. The levels of Es and Noc are selected to achieve a target Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as described in Clause 4.5.2. 

Mode 2, on the other hand, operates under noise-free conditions. Here, only the wanted signal with power level Es is transmitted, with no external noise.

For Mode 1 conditions, the minimum performance requirements for UE demodulation and CSI are defined relative to the baseband SNR level (SNRBB). The SNR at the reference point is calculated as SNR = SNRBB + ∆BB, where ∆BB is specified in Clause 4.5.3. The reference point SNR definition includes several assumptions: NRX denotes the number of receiver reference points, and the superscript receiver reference point j. It assumes that the Resource Elements (REs) are not precoded and does not account for any gain from the precoding operation. Unless otherwise stated, the SNR refers to the Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS) wanted signal.

The downlink SSS transmit power is defined as the linear average over the power contributions in watts (W) of all resource elements carrying the SSS within the operating system bandwidth. Additionally, the power ratio of other wanted signals to the SSS is defined in Clause C.3.1.","The answer should include the definitions and conditions for Mode 1 and Mode 2, specifying the power levels Es and Noc, and how they achieve the target SNR. It should explain the SNR definition at the reference point, including the role of SNRBB and ∆BB, and the assumptions about REs and precoding. Additionally, it should cover the SNR for the SSS wanted signal, the downlink SSS transmit power, and the power ratio of other wanted signals to SSS."
"What are the key elements of UE policies for 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526, and how are these policies delivered and applied?","The key elements of UE policies for 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 include the UE route selection policy (URSP), Access network discovery and selection policy (ANDSP), V2X policy (V2XP), and 5G ProSe policy (ProSeP). These policies can be delivered from the Policy Control Function (PCF) to the User Equipment (UE), 5G Residential Gateway (5G-RG), or a Wireless Access Gateway Function (W-AGF) acting on behalf of the Fixed Network Residential Gateway (FN-RG). The delivery procedure for these policies is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501. 

Additionally, these policies can also be pre-configured in the UE, 5G-RG, or W-AGF. However, the pre-configured policy shall only be applied when the same type of policy has not been received from the PCF. The implementation of pre-configured UE policies is out of the scope of this specification. 

For further details, the UE policies for V2X (V2XP) are specified in 3GPP TS 24.588, and the UE policies for 5G ProSe policy (ProSeP) are specified in 3GPP TS 24.555.","The answer must include the types of UE policies for 5GS (URSP, ANDSP, V2XP, ProSeP), the methods of delivering these policies from the PCF to the UE, 5G-RG, or W-AGF, and the conditions under which pre-configured policies are applied. It should also reference the specific 3GPP documents where further details on V2XP and ProSeP policies can be found."
"Explain the Sidelink Channel State Information (SL-CSI) reporting procedure in 3GPP specifications, including the configuration parameters, MAC entity operations, and the structure of the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC Control Element (CE).","The Sidelink Channel State Information (SL-CSI) reporting procedure is designed to provide a peer User Equipment (UE) with sidelink channel state information. This procedure is configured and controlled by the Radio Resource Control (RRC) through specific parameters, primarily the sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report, which is maintained for each PC5-RRC connection.

The Medium Access Control (MAC) entity plays a crucial role in managing the SL-CSI reporting procedure. It maintains an sl-CSI-ReportTimer for each pair of Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection. The sl-CSI-ReportTimer ensures that the SL-CSI reporting UE adheres to the latency requirements signaled by the CSI triggering UE, with the timer value matching the latency requirement specified in the sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report.

The MAC entity performs several operations based on the status of the sl-CSI-ReportTimer:
1. If SL-CSI reporting is triggered by a Sidelink Control Information (SCI) and the timer is not running, the MAC entity starts the sl-CSI-ReportTimer.
2. If the timer expires, the MAC entity cancels the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
3. If SL resources are allocated for new transmission and can accommodate the SL-CSI reporting MAC Control Element (CE) and its subheader, the MAC entity instructs the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the SL-CSI Reporting MAC CE, stops the timer, and cancels the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
4. If the MAC entity is configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 and the transmission cannot meet the latency requirement, it triggers a Scheduling Request.

The Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with a Logical Channel ID (LCID) and has a fixed priority of '1'. The structure of the MAC CE includes:
- Rank Indicator (RI): A 1-bit field indicating the derived value of the Rank Indicator for sidelink CSI reporting.
- Channel Quality Indicator (CQI): A 4-bit field indicating the derived value of the Channel Quality Indicator for sidelink CSI reporting.
- Reserved bit (R): A bit set to 0.

The detailed specifications for the RI and CQI fields are provided in the relevant 3GPP documents, ensuring accurate and standardized reporting of sidelink channel state information.","The answer must include:
  - An overview of the SL-CSI reporting procedure and its purpose

Describe the security architecture and key elements for V2X services as specified in 3GPP TS 33.185.,"The security architecture for V2X services as specified in 3GPP TS 33.185 encompasses various types of vehicular communication services, including V2V (vehicle to vehicle), V2I (vehicle to infrastructure), V2N (vehicle to network), and V2P (vehicle to pedestrian). These services cater to both safety and non-safety aspects of vehicular communication.

The overall architecture for V2X services is detailed in TS 23.285, which includes LTE-Uu based architecture (such as eMBMS) and PC5 based architecture. These architectures can be used independently by a User Equipment (UE) for transmission and reception. For instance, a UE can utilize eMBMS for reception without necessarily using LTE-Uu for transmission.

Security for the interfaces within the overall architecture is thoroughly covered in clause 6 of TS 33.185. This includes:
- Security between network entities (clause 6.2)
- Security between UE and V2X Control Function (clause 6.3)

"Describe the process and key elements involved in the TSC stream creation procedure as outlined in TS 23.434, including the roles of the VAL server and NRM server, and the information flow between them.","The TSC stream creation procedure as outlined in TS 23.434 involves several key elements and steps, primarily focusing on the interaction between the VAL server and the NRM server. 

1. **Role of the VAL Server**: The VAL server initiates the TSC stream creation request. This request is sent to the NRM server and includes the VAL Stream ID, DS-TT ports, and traffic class specifications.

2. **Role of the NRM Server**: Upon receiving the request, the NRM server processes it by calculating the schedule for the VAL Stream ID based on previously collected information from the 5GS. The NRM server determines the TSC QoS information and TSC Assistance information for the stream, and provides per-stream filtering and policing parameters, as well as forwarding rules.

3. **Information Flow**:
   - **Request**: The information flow begins with the VAL server sending a TSC stream creation request to the NRM server (as described in Table 14.3.2.25-1).
   - **Response**: After processing the request, the NRM server sends a TSC stream creation response back to the VAL server (as described in Table 14.3.2.26-1).

4. **Pre-conditions**: Several pre-conditions must be met before the TSC stream creation procedure can commence:
   - Each UE must have an established Ethernet PDU session for its DS-TT port MAC address.
   - Connectivity between the DS-TTs must be validated by the TSC stream availability discovery procedure.
   - The NRM server must maintain mapping from the traffic class to TSC QoS.

5. **Detailed Steps**:
   - The NRM server receives the TSC stream creation request from the VAL server.
   - It calculates the schedule for the VAL Stream ID, provides filtering and policing parameters, and determines the TSC QoS information and TSC Assistance information.
   - The NRM server triggers the Npcf_policy_Authorization_Create service operation for both UL and DL QoS flows, including necessary details such as DS-TT port MAC address, flow bit rate, priority, and Ethernet Packet Filters.
   - Finally, the NRM server sends the TSC stream creation response to the VAL server with the result of the TSC stream creation.

6. **API Operation**: The API operation for TSC stream creation is named TSC_Stream_Creation. It involves requesting the NRM to create a TSC stream, with inputs and outputs specified in subclauses 14.3.2.25 and 14.3.2.26, respectively. Detailed usage of this API operation is described in subclause 14.3.7.3.

What are the key specifications and requirements for base station output power and reference sensitivity levels as outlined in the 3GPP TS 37.104 document?,"The 3GPP TS 37.104 document outlines several key specifications and requirements for base station output power and reference sensitivity levels. 

For base station output power, the document defines various metrics:
- **Pmax**: The maximum total output power of the base station, measured as the mean power level at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a specified reference condition.
- **Pmax,RAT**: The maximum RAT output power, which is the mean power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition.
- **Pmax,c**: The maximum carrier output power, defined as the mean power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition.
- **PRated,c**: The rated carrier output power, which is the mean power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.

Additionally, the document includes a note on NB-IoT operation, stating that for NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, the LTE carrier and NB-IoT carrier should be seen as a single carrier occupied LTE channel bandwidth, with the output power shared between LTE and NB-IoT. Similarly, for NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT carrier should be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth, with the output power shared between NR and NB-IoT. This note applies to Pout, rated total output power, Pmax,c, and PRated,c.

For Band 85 NB-IoT standalone operation, the document specifies a base station rated output power limit of 43 dBm over the NB-IoT carriers in the range 728-729 MHz of the DL operating band. This limit is shared among all NB-IoT carriers in the 728-729 MHz frequency range or is the maximum value per NB-IoT carrier if only one NB-IoT carrier is deployed in this frequency range.

Regarding reference sensitivity levels, the document specifies the minimum requirements for GSM/EDGE:
- The minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified in TS 45.005, subclause 6.2 and Annex P.1.
- The minimum requirements for reference sensitivity level and reference interference level are detailed in TS 45.005, clauses 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6, with the conditions specified in Annex P.1 being valid for GSM sensitivity and interference performance.

"How should compliance with 3GPP TS be claimed, and what are the guidelines for using trade names and referencing clauses and annexes in 3GPP documents?","To claim compliance with a 3GPP Technical Specification (TS), it is essential to identify the requirements that are obligatory and distinguish them from provisions where there is a certain freedom of choice. Clear rules for the use of verbal forms are crucial in this process. Annex E provides the verbal forms that should be used to express each kind of provision, ensuring clarity in compliance requirements.

When designating or describing a product, it is recommended to use a correct designation rather than a trade name or brand name. Proprietary trade names should be avoided as much as possible. If trade names cannot be avoided, their nature should be indicated, for example, by using the symbol ® for a registered trademark. In cases where only one product is suitable for the application of the standard, the trade name may be given but must be accompanied by a note indicating that this does not constitute an endorsement by 3GPP and that equivalent products may be used. If it is essential to provide examples of commercially available products, trade names may be given in a note for the convenience of users.

For referencing clauses and annexes in 3GPP documents, specific forms should be used, such as ","The answer must include details on how to claim compliance with 3GPP TS, the importance of identifying obligatory requirements, the rules for using verbal forms, guidelines for designating products and avoiding trade names, examples of notes for trade names, and the correct forms for referencing clauses and annexes.

Each value in this AVP can indicate a single determined optional capability or a set of capabilities, as described in the same clause of 3GPP TS 29.228.","The answer should include the type of each AVP (Unsigned32), the purpose of each AVP (representing mandatory or optional capabilities of an S-CSCF), and reference to 3GPP TS 29.228 clause 6.7 for further details on the capabilities."
"Describe the synchronization and timing adjustment procedures in 3GPP TS 25.435, including the steps involved in transport bearer replacement for DSCH and USCH.","The synchronization and timing adjustment procedures in 3GPP TS 25.435 are essential for ensuring proper communication between the CRNC and Node B. 

The DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame is sent by the CRNC to Node B, indicating the target CFN. Upon receiving this frame, Node B immediately responds with an UL SYNCHRONISATION control frame, which includes the Time of Arrival (ToA) for the DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame and the CFN indicated in the received message. This procedure is not applied to transport bearers carrying UL traffic channels such as RACH, E-DCH for CELL_FACH and Idle, or USCH. When using an IP multicast transport bearer, the target CFN indicates the target MFN, and Node B responds via a unicast transport bearer. If a transport bearer without IP multicast option is used by several FACH channels, the procedure applies to all these channels.

The Timing Adjustment procedure is initiated by Node B when a DL frame arrives outside the defined arrival window. If the DL frame arrives before the Time of Arrival Window Startpoint (ToAWS) or after the Time of Arrival Window Endpoint (ToAWE), Node B includes the ToA and the target CFN as parameters in the TIMING ADJUSTMENT control frame. The ToAWE represents the latest time point for timely DL transmission, while the ToAWS represents the earliest time point for DL data arrival. The ToA is the time difference between the ToAWE and the actual arrival time of the DL frame, with positive ToA indicating early arrival and negative ToA indicating late arrival.

Transport bearer replacement for DSCH and USCH involves three steps:
1. Establishing the new transport bearer, resulting in two parallel transport bearers.
2. Switching the transport channels to the new transport bearer, with DSCH or USCH DATA FRAMEs transported on the new bearer from the CFN indicated in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message. Node B supports all applicable Common Transport Channels frame protocol procedures on the new bearer from this CFN.
3. Releasing the old transport bearer.

During DSCH transport bearer replacement, Node B supports DSCH DATA FRAMEs, DL Transport Channel Synchronisation, and DL Timing Adjustment procedures on the new bearer to determine timing. DSCH DATA FRAMEs on the new bearer are not transmitted on the Uu Interface before the CFN indicated in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message. For USCH transport bearer replacement, communication continues as normal on the old bearer until the switch.

These procedures ensure synchronized and timely data transmission between CRNC and Node B, accommodating various transport bearer configurations and channel types.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The purpose and process of the DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame and UL SYNCHRONISATION control frame, including the target CFN and ToA.
  - The Timing Adjustment procedure, including the conditions under which it is initiated, the parameters involved (ToAWS, ToAWE, ToA), and the role of the TIMING ADJUSTMENT control frame.
  - The steps involved in transport bearer replacement for DSCH and USCH, including the establishment of the new transport bearer, switching of transport channels, and release of the old transport bearer.
  - Any specific considerations for IP multicast transport bearers and FACH channels."
"Describe the process of creating a Network Exposure Event Subscription, including the necessary HTTP requests, data structures, and authorization procedures.","The process of creating a Network Exposure Event Subscription involves several steps, including sending HTTP requests, utilizing specific data structures, and following authorization procedures.

1. **Initial HTTP POST Request**: To subscribe to event notifications, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP POST request to the NEF with the URI '{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions' and the 'NefEventExposureSubsc' data structure as the request body. This data structure includes mandatory attributes such as 'notifUri' (the URI to receive notifications), 'notifId' (Notification Correlation Identifier), and 'eventsSubs' (description of subscribed event information). Optional attributes may include 'eventsRepInfo' (event reporting information) and 'dataAccProfId' (Data Access Profile Identifier).

2. **Response Handling**: Upon successful reception of the HTTP POST request, the NEF creates a new 'Individual Network Exposure Event Subscription' resource, stores the subscription, and sends an HTTP '201 Created' response. This response includes a Location header field containing the URI of the created resource and the 'NefEventExposureSubsc' data type payload body representing the created subscription. Attributes such as 'monDur' (Monitoring Duration), 'immRep' (immediate reporting indication), 'sampRatio' (sampling ratio), 'partitionCriteria' (partitioning criteria), 'grpRepTime' (group reporting guard time), and 'notifFlag' (notification flag) are handled accordingly.

3. **Error Handling**: If the NEF cannot fulfill the HTTP POST request due to an internal error or an error in the request, it sends an HTTP error response as specified in the relevant procedures.

4. **Authorization Procedures**: The authorization process involves the Data Collection AF and Authorization AS. Initially, the Provisioning AF provisions the data collection and report exposure functionality, including Data Access Profiles. The event consumer sends a subscription request to the Data Collection AF, which redirects the consumer to the Authorization AS to obtain access. The consumer contacts the Authorization AS with valid credentials, and if access is granted, receives an access token (and possibly a Data Access Profile ID). The consumer resends the subscription request to the Data Collection AF with the access token, and upon successful verification, the Data Collection AF approves the subscription request and sends event notifications to the consumer.

5. **Notification Procedures**: The NEF uses the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation to notify the NF service consumer of accumulated event reports, as described in the relevant procedures.

Overall, the process involves careful handling of HTTP requests and responses, detailed data structures, and a robust authorization mechanism to ensure secure and efficient event subscription and notification.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The initial HTTP POST request to the NEF with the URI '{apiRoot}/nnef-eventexposure/<apiVersion>/subscriptions' and the 'NefEventExposureSubsc' data structure.
- The mandatory and optional attributes within the 'NefEventExposureSubsc' data structure.
- The response handling by the NEF, including the '201 Created' response and the attributes included in the response.
- Error handling procedures if the NEF cannot fulfill the request.
- The authorization process involving the Data Collection AF and Authorization AS, including the steps for obtaining and using access tokens and Data Access Profile IDs.
- The notification procedures using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation."
Describe the conformance requirements and testing procedures for the SET UP MENU proactive SIM command as defined in TS 51.010.,"The conformance requirements for the SET UP MENU proactive SIM command are outlined in TS 51.010. The requirements are the same as those in clause 27.22.4.8.1.1, with additional references to TS 11.14 clauses 6.5.4, 12.31, and 12.32. The test purpose is to verify that the Mobile Equipment (ME) correctly integrates the menu items contained in the SET UP MENU proactive SIM command and returns a successful response in the TERMINAL RESPONSE command sent to the SIM. It also aims to verify that icons are displayed with the command Set Up Menu in the Alpha Identifier and Items Data Objects, and that the ME correctly passes the identifier of the selected menu item to the SIM using the ENVELOPE (MENU SELECTION) command.

The method of test includes initial conditions where the ME is connected to the SIM Simulator, the elementary files are coded as Toolkit default, the ME has been powered on and performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure, and the ME screen is in its normal stand-by display. The procedure involves executing expected sequences such as SET UP MENU with basic icons that are not self-explanatory (4.1A and 4.1B) and SET UP MENU with basic icons that are self-explanatory (4.2A and 4.2B).

"Describe the process and requirements for deregistering an EES from the ECS, including the handling of HTTP DELETE requests and potential redirections.","To deregister an EES from the ECS, the EES must send an HTTP DELETE message to the ECS, targeting the resource URI that identifies the individual EES registration resource representation. Upon receiving this request, the ECS will first verify the identity of the EES and check if the EES is authorized to deregister its registration information. If authorized, the ECS will proceed to deregister the EES profile and delete the resource representing the EES registration information. The ECS will then return a '204 No Content' message to the EES, indicating successful deregistration.

In case of failure, the ECS will handle errors as specified in clause 9.1.6 and respond with an appropriate error status code. If the ECS determines that the HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, it may respond with a '307 Temporary Redirect' or '308 Permanent Redirect' status code, including a Location header with an alternative URI for the new endpoint where the request should be redirected.

"Describe the procedures and key steps involved in upgrading an ongoing MCData group FD communication to an MCData emergency group FD communication, and how this process differs when the imminent peril indicator is set.","The procedure for upgrading an ongoing MCData group FD communication to an MCData emergency group FD communication involves several key steps and pre-conditions. Initially, the MCData group must be defined on the group management server, with all members affiliated to the same MCData system. An MCData group FD communication should already be in progress, and the initiating MCData client must be configured to send an MCData emergency alert when upgrading to an emergency group communication.

The steps for upgrading to an emergency state are as follows:
1. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates a group emergency, setting its MCData emergency state, which is retained until explicitly cancelled.
2. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the MCData group to an in-progress emergency state by sending an MCData group FD upgrade request, including an emergency indicator and, if configured, an MCData alert.
3. The MCData server sets the emergency state of the MCData group and adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all or selected participants receiving the communication over unicast.
4. The MCData server sends the MCData group FD upgrade request to the MCData clients of each affiliated group member, including an indication of an MCData emergency alert if applicable.
5. MCData users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCData group.
6. The receiving MCData clients send an MCData group FD upgrade response to the MCData server to acknowledge the emergency request, except in multicast calls.
7. The MCData server sends the MCData group FD upgrade response to MCData client 1 to confirm the upgrade request.

When the imminent peril indicator is set, the procedure includes specific clarifications:
- In step 2, MCData client 1 sets the imminent peril indicator.
- In step 3, the bearers' priority is adjusted to correspond to an imminent peril priority, which may differ from the emergency priority setting.
- In step 5, MCData users are notified of the in-progress imminent peril state of the MCData group.

These adjustments ensure that the communication reflects the urgency and priority associated with imminent peril situations.","The answer should include the following key details:
- The initial setup and pre-conditions for the MCData group FD communication.
- The steps involved in upgrading the communication to an emergency state, including the role of the MCData client and server.

Describe the mapping and encoding rules for SIP messages in TTCN-3 as specified in the 3GPP TS 34.229 documents.,"The mapping and encoding rules for SIP messages in TTCN-3 as specified in the 3GPP TS 34.229 documents involve several key aspects:

1. **BNF Grammars and Syntax Trees**:
   - BNF grammars, such as the ABNF of RFC 3261, are used to uniquely identify and describe parts of SIP messages. Each syntactically correct message derived from these grammars has a unique syntax tree.
   - The syntax tree can be used to uniquely identify and describe the parts of the messages. The leaves represent the parts of every message, and the nodes from the root to the leaves represent the sequence of rules applied to derive that part.
   - In TTCN-3, the IMS/SIP root message type is represented as a record type. For each grammar rule of the ABNF, a TTCN-3 record type is declared with the specific name of the rule. Non-terminal symbols are declared as record types, the order of symbols in the rule is preserved, repetitions are declared as 'set of' or 'record of' types, options are represented as optional record/set fields, and alternatives are declared as union types.

2. **Mapping of SIP Message Types and Header Fields**:
   - The root message type is directly a Request or Response type, represented as a TTCN-3 record. Method names (e.g., INVITE, BYE, ACK) and message header field names (e.g., To, From, CallID) are mapped to enumerated types in TTCN-3 to simplify the extension of new headers.

For E-UTRA, DL RS power is the resource element power of the Downlink Reference Symbol, and the absolute DL RS power is indicated on the Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH). The absolute accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL RS power indicated on the DL-SCH and the DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier at the base station (BS) antenna connector.

"Describe the resolution mechanism for finding the HSS address in a network with multiple HSSs, including the roles of I-CSCF, S-CSCF, AS, and SLF, and the interfaces used for communication.","The resolution mechanism for finding the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) address in a network with multiple HSSs involves several key components and interfaces. This mechanism enables the Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF), Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF), and Application Server (AS) to locate the HSS that holds the subscriber data for a given user identity.

The Subscription Locator Function (SLF) or a Diameter Proxy Agent is used to proxy the request to the appropriate HSS. This mechanism is necessary when multiple and separately addressable HSSs are deployed by the network operator. In networks utilizing a single HSS, this resolution mechanism can be optionally switched off.

The I-CSCF and S-CSCF use the Dx interface to communicate with the SLF, while the AS uses the Dh interface. The Dx interface includes operations such as DX_SLF_QUERY, where the I-CSCF or S-CSCF sends a query to the SLF with the user identity, and DX_SLF_RESP, where the SLF responds with the HSS name. Similarly, the Dh interface includes operations such as DH_SLF_QUERY, where the AS sends a query to the SLF with the Public User Identity, and DH_SLF_RESP, where the SLF responds with the HSS name.

For REGISTER requests, the I-CSCF receives the request and queries the SLF using the DX_SLF_QUERY operation. The SLF looks up its database and responds with the HSS name, allowing the I-CSCF to proceed by querying the appropriate HSS. In some cases, the I-CSCF may forward the HSS name to the S-CSCF, which then queries the SLF in a similar manner.

For INVITE requests, the I-CSCF queries the SLF using the DX_SLF_QUERY operation, including the user identity from the INVITE request. If the user identity is an E.164 number in the SIP URI format, the I-CSCF translates it into the Tel URI format before sending the query. The SLF responds with the HSS name, allowing the I-CSCF to proceed by querying the appropriate HSS.

The AS queries the SLF using the DH_SLF_QUERY operation, including the Public User Identity. The SLF responds with the HSS name, allowing the AS to send the Sh message towards the correct HSS.

To prevent SLF service failure, such as in the event of a server outage, the SLF can be distributed over multiple servers. Approaches like using DNS mechanisms with DNS SRV records can be employed to discover these servers, although the specific algorithm for this is outside the scope of the document.

In summary, the resolution mechanism involves querying the SLF using the Dx and Dh interfaces to find the HSS address, with specific steps for REGISTER and INVITE requests by I-CSCF and S-CSCF, and for AS access to HSS.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of the resolution mechanism for finding the HSS address in networks with multiple HSSs.

Describe the process and responsibilities for the allocation and management of 3GPP allocated port numbers as specified in TS 29.641.,"The allocation and management of 3GPP allocated port numbers are primarily the responsibility of 3GPP CT4. They manage and maintain the service name and port number registry within a specific sub-range of ports from 65400 to 65500, which falls under the Dynamic/Private Port range [49152 - 65535]. Notably, IANA does not assign port numbers from this range. According to solution#6, as specified in clause 4.4 of 3GPP TR 29.941, 3GPP CT4 is tasked with maintaining the 3GPP allocated port number repository.

The procedure for port number allocation based on solution#6 involves several steps:
1. A 3GPP working group (WG) that decides to use the 3GPP allocated port number solution#6 must send a Liaison Statement (LS) request to 3GPP CT4. This request must address the following checklist:
   a. The request should be for a protocol supported by intra-domain interface(s).
   b. The request should indicate that it cannot meet IANA/IETF requirements for port number allocation, as detailed in Annex C of 3GPP TR 29.941.
   c. The request should show that solution#6 is preferable and has been selected after evaluating other solutions specified in 3GPP TR 29.941.
2. Upon receiving the request, 3GPP CT4 will inform the requesting 3GPP WG and may also inform other relevant 3GPP WGs about the decision. 
3. 3GPP CT4 will then create a Change Request (CR). If the CT plenary approves the CR, the assigned port number will be added to Table 5-1 as specified in clause 5.

An Application Server (AS) providing the logic of an originating Hosted Enterprise Service (HES) may implement communication admission control based on the number of simultaneous communications to/from the HES. The support of private numbering is described in subclause 6.5. The UE or AGCF can be configured to insert a default session destination in the Request when a dial string is not entered by the end user. This default session destination can be manually configured by the user or received from the Core Network Gateway Control Function (CNGCF). The AS acting as the originating HES can determine the actual session destination from local configuration data and/or the user profile and rewrite the Request accordingly.

The AS procedures for modifying the P-Asserted-Identity headers for originating requests depend on operator and enterprise domain policies, privacy settings as specified in IETF RFC 3323 and IETF RFC 3325, and whether the destination belongs to the same enterprise domain as the session initiator. The AS can act as a SIP Proxy, Routing Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), or Initiating B2BUA, depending on the type of changes made to the identities in the INVITE messages.

For terminating communications, the setup procedures must also comply with 3GPP TS 23.228 or ETSI TS 182 012, depending on the type of endpoint. The UE must adhere to the requirements identified in 3GPP TS 24.229, subclause 4.1. The AGCF must comply with the procedures specified in ETSI TS 183 043 appropriate to this entity. Each IMS functional entity involved in terminating communications must comply with the procedures specified in the clauses of 3GPP TS 24.229 and 3GPP TS 24.628 appropriate to this entity.

An AS providing the logic of a terminating HES may implement communication admission control based on the number of simultaneous communications sent to/from the HES. Terminating communications to a group are described in subclause 6.6.

In summary, the communication setup procedures for both originating and terminating communications involve compliance with specific 3GPP and ETSI technical specifications, additional requirements for UE and AGCF, communication admission control by AS, support of private numbering, configuration of default session destinations, and modification of P-Asserted-Identity headers.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Originating communication setup procedures and the compliance requirements with 3GPP TS 23.228 or ETSI TS 182 012.

"Explain the procedures and conditions under which the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to through-connect terminations in both directions, referencing the relevant clauses.","The procedures and conditions under which the Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF) requests the IP Multimedia Gateway (IM-MGW) to through-connect terminations in both directions are detailed in several clauses.

Firstly, the UID capability indicators parameter is defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.763. When a both-way media path is available, user interactive dialogs prior to answer can be supported through the use of the P-Early-Media header field authorizing both-way media. If the received initial INVITE request contains a P-Early-Media header field with the 'supported' value and either the SDP in the INVITE request allows a send/receive media path or the INVITE request does not contain an SDP body, then the UID capability indicators parameter in the outgoing IAM message may be set accordingly.

For further details on the UID capability indicators parameter, clause 7.2.3.1.2.13 should be referenced.

During the Prepare Bearer and Establish Bearer procedures, the MGCF can use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to backward through-connect the BICC terminations or to both-way through-connect the BICC termination already at this stage. Specifically, if the MGCF identifies a call as an 'ICS call', it will request the IM-MGW to suspend sending media towards the IMS side by setting the through-connection of the IM CN subsystem side termination to 'not through-connected' using the Change IMS Through-Connection procedure. Otherwise, the MGCF will use the Change IMS Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to backward through-connect the IMS termination.

When the MGCF receives a BICC ACM or CPG message with a UID action indicators parameter with the through-connection instruction indicator set to 'through-connect in both directions', it will request the IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the terminations using the Change IMS Through-Connection or Change Through-Connection procedures, unless those terminations are already both-way through-connected. Similarly, upon receiving the BICC:ANM answer indication, the MGCF will request the IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the terminations using the same procedures, unless those terminations are already both-way through-connected.

These procedures ensure that media paths are correctly established and managed based on the signaling messages and the specific conditions outlined in the relevant clauses.","The answer should include:
- The definition and conditions for setting the UID capability indicators parameter as per Document 1.
- The reference to clause 7.2.3.1.2.13 for further details as mentioned in Document 2.

Describe the procedures and information flows involved in the UE-to-UE broadcast/groupcast delivery configuration and execution as specified in 3GPP TS 23.286.,"The UE-to-UE broadcast/groupcast delivery configuration and execution in 3GPP TS 23.286 involves several key procedures and information flows:

1. **Role of the VAE Client**: The VAE client is responsible for configuring policies for UE-to-UE broadcast/groupcast delivery based on requirements received from the VAE server. This configuration aims to reduce V2X broadcast flooding while ensuring that the KPIs for one or more V2X services in a service area are met.

2. **Procedures for Configuration and Delivery**:
   - **UE-to-UE Broadcast/Groupcast Configuration**: As specified in clause 9.17.3, the VAE client configures the broadcast/groupcast policies for the UE-to-UE communication.
   - **UE-to-UE Delivery**: As specified in clause 9.17.4, the VAE clients handle the delivery of messages over V5-AE based on the configured policies.

3. **Information Flow for V2V Configuration Requirement**:
   - **Request**: The V2X application specific server sends a V2V configuration requirement request to the VAE server, as described in Table 9.17.2.1-1 (clause 9.17.2.1).
   - **Response**: The VAE server responds to the V2X application specific server with the V2V configuration requirement response, as detailed in Table 9.17.2.2-1 (clause 9.17.2.2).

4. **Detailed Procedure for VAE Client Delivering VAE Messages**:
   - **Pre-conditions**: VAE clients of the V2X-UEs must have received and stored the UE-to-UE broadcast/groupcast configuration policies per V2X application.
   - **Step-by-Step Message Handling**:
     1. The V2X application specific client of the transmitting V2X UE sends the V2X message to be broadcasted/groupcasted to the VAE client.
     2. The VAE client retrieves the mapping for the V2X service and configuration policy related to the V2X message and forms a VAE message.
     3. The VAE message is sent from the transmitting V2X-UE to the receiving V2X-UE(s), which may act as application relays or destination V2X-UEs.
     4. The destination VAE client provides the V2X message to the corresponding V2X application specific client, unbundling the message if necessary.

5. **API Operation for Request_V2VConfigRequirement**:
   - **Description**: The V2X application specific server provides a V2V configuration requirement request to the VAE server to manage UE-to-UE broadcast/groupcast communication.

"Explain the process and considerations for key derivation and algorithm selection during an X2/S1 handover in a 3GPP network, particularly focusing on the handling of unauthenticated emergency calls and the implications of different eNB releases.","During an X2/S1 handover in a 3GPP network, the User Equipment (UE) and the evolved Node B (eNB) derive and transfer the necessary keys to facilitate the handover using the standard mechanism. This process ensures that the derived keys are used to maintain the security of the communication. However, it is important to note that these derived keys do not influence the output of the NULL algorithms, meaning that even if the network and the UE derive different keys, it does not impact the handover process.

For unauthenticated emergency calls, the algorithm selection is handled differently. The source eNB forwards the UE's Evolved Packet System (EPS) security capability, which includes only the EIA0 (integrity protection) and EEA0 (confidentiality protection) algorithms, to the target eNB. Consequently, the target eNB can only select EIA0 for integrity protection and EEA0 for confidentiality protection during the handover. If the UE does not receive any new AS security algorithm selection during an intra-eNB handover, it continues to use the same algorithms as before the handover.

A significant consideration arises if the target eNB is a Release-8 (Rel-8) eNB. Rel-8 eNBs do not support the EIA0 and EEA0 algorithms. As a result, the handover will be rejected due to the failure of algorithm negotiation, as the target eNB cannot accommodate the security capabilities forwarded by the source eNB. This highlights the importance of compatibility between the eNB releases and the supported security algorithms during the handover process.","The answer should cover the following points: 
  - The standard process for key derivation and transfer during X2/S1 handover.
  - The specific handling of unauthenticated emergency calls, including the forwarding of UE EPS security capability and the selection of EIA0 and EEA0 algorithms.
  - The implications if the target eNB is a Rel-8 eNB, including the potential for handover rejection due to algorithm negotiation failure."
"Describe the conventions and presentation formats used for data variables, inputs, outputs, and intermediate states in the 3GPP TS 35.232 specification.","The 3GPP TS 35.232 specification outlines specific conventions and formats for presenting data variables, inputs, outputs, and intermediate states. 

Firstly, all data variables are presented with the most significant substring on the left-hand side and the least significant substring on the right-hand side. A substring can be a bit, byte, or other arbitrary length bit string. When a variable is broken down into multiple substrings, the most significant substring is numbered 0, the next most significant is numbered 1, and so on, up to the least significant substring. For example, RAND[0] is the most significant bit of RAND, and RAND[127] is the least significant bit of RAND. This convention applies to all inputs and outputs to Tuak.

Secondly, the IN and OUT strings are presented as lists of 200 bytes (octets), with each byte written separately in hexadecimal notation. The lists should be read from left to right and then from top to bottom. For IN, the first byte of the list denotes the bits IN[0] to IN[7], with IN[0] being the least significant bit and IN[7] being the most significant bit of the corresponding hexadecimal number. The final byte of the list denotes IN[1592] to IN[1599], with IN[1592] being the least significant bit and IN[1599] being the most significant bit. OUT strings follow the same format.

Additionally, each test in the specification starts by showing various inputs (K, RAND, SQN, AMF) to the functions, followed by the operator configuration field TOP and other parameters such as the length of K, the length of the output MAC, and the number of Keccak iterations. The value of TOPC and the output values of f1 and f1* are then shown. All input, output, and configuration parameters are presented using the bit/byte ordering convention described in clause 4.3. Intermediate inputs and outputs to the permutation Π are shown as lists of 200 bytes, using the convention described in clause 5.2.

Similarly, for other tests, the inputs K and RAND to the functions are shown first, followed by the operator configuration field TOP and other parameters such as the length of K, the length of the outputs CK, IK, and RES, and the number of Keccak iterations. The value of TOPC and the output values of f2-f5 and f5* are then shown. Again, all input, output, and configuration parameters are presented using the bit/byte ordering convention from clause 4.3, and intermediate inputs and outputs to the permutation Π are shown as lists of 200 bytes, using the convention from clause 5.2.","The answer should include the conventions for presenting data variables, including the significance and numbering of substrings. It should describe the format for presenting IN and OUT strings, including the reading order and bit positions within bytes. The answer should also cover the presentation of various inputs and operator configuration parameters, and the use of specific conventions for intermediate inputs and outputs as described in the relevant clauses."

  2. The SS starts sending PDCCHs indicating new transmissions continuously on Cell 1.
  3. The SS sends an RRCReconfiguration message containing updated UE specific CBW.
  4. T1 starts from the beginning of the last slot carrying the PDSCH containing the RRCReconfiguration message.
  5. If the UE reports valid ACK/NACK for PCell from the first UL slot after the beginning of DL slot, the test is considered successful.
  6. After receiving the ACK/NACK or when T1 expires, the SS transmits an RRCRelease message or switches off the UE.
  7. Depending on the previous step, the SS either transmits a Paging message or switches on the UE.
  8. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED again and repeat steps 2-8 until the confidence level is achieved.

- **Message Contents**: The message contents are defined according to TS 38.508-1 clause 7.3 with specific exceptions listed in tables for ServingCellConfigCommon, ServingCellConfig, SCS-SpecificCarrier-DL, and SCS-SpecificCarrier-UL.

Channel Bandwidth to be tested: The channel bandwidth is set to 5 MHz for cells on both the Primary Component Carrier (PCC) and Secondary Component Carrier (SCC).

Connection Setup: The SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources are connected to the UE antenna connectors. For UEs supporting only 2Rx in all the bands under test, the setup uses appropriate figures from Annex A. For UEs supporting 4Rx in any of the bands under test, the setup uses Figure A.90 without a neighbor on PCell, utilizing the 2Rx module for bands supporting 2Rx and the 4Rx module for bands supporting 4Rx.

"Describe the process and requirements for a UE to monitor MBMS services using DRX on the MCCH, including the calculation of the Notification Indicator (NI) and the structure of the TMGI.","When a User Equipment (UE) operates Discontinuous Reception (DRX) on the Multicast Control Channel (MCCH) through monitoring the Multicast Indicator Channel (MICH), it needs to monitor one Notification Indicator (NI) for each Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) it is subscribed to. The NI for each service is set continuously throughout the entire modification period preceding a change in the associated MCCH information. This modification period must be long enough to ensure that a UE, which only receives the MICH during its paging occasions, can reliably detect a notification.

For each MBMS service, the 16-bit NI is calculated as a function of the Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI). The calculation involves interpreting the TMGI as a binary representation of an integer number. This is done by forming a bitstring through the exclusive OR operation of the MBMS Service ID (octets 3 to 5 of the TMGI) and the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) identity (octets 6 to 8 of the TMGI), with the first/leftmost/most significant bit corresponding to b8 of the first octet.

A UE with one or more activated MBMS services may monitor the MICH. The exact timing with which the UE reads the MICH within a given modification period is left to the UE implementation, provided that the UE can reliably detect notifications for its activated MBMS services.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the requirements and considerations for lawful interception in 3GPP networks, particularly focusing on the roles of PDN-GW, S-GW, ePDG, and HSS, and the use of IMSI and NAI identifiers.","Lawful interception in 3GPP networks involves several key components and considerations, particularly focusing on the roles of PDN-GW, S-GW, ePDG, and HSS, and the use of IMSI and NAI identifiers.

For the PDN-GW, interception is required in both non-roaming scenarios (where the PDN-GW is in the Home Public Land Mobile Network, HPLMN) and roaming scenarios with local breakout (where the PDN-GW is in the Visited Public Land Mobile Network, VPLMN). In these cases, interception at the PDN-GW is mandatory. However, for roaming without local breakout (PDN-GW in the HPLMN and S-GW in the VPLMN), interception at the PDN-GW is a national option.

Interception in the S-GW and PDN-GW is based on either the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or the Network Access Identifier (NAI). It is recommended to use IMSI because NAI may be a temporary identifier. The delivery of Call Content (CC) and Intercept Related Information (IRI) involves the S-GW and/or PDN-GW providing a correlation number and target identity to the Delivery Function (DF2 and DF3), which is used to select the appropriate Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) for product delivery. The correlation number is unique within the entire Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and is used to correlate CC with IRI and different IRIs of one IP-CAN session. Different protocols (e.g., GTP and PMIP) may generate different values by different nodes, but the correlation number is generated using existing parameters related to the IP-CAN session.

Specific events that constitute Intercept Related Information (IRI) include serving system changes, subscriber record changes, registration terminations, and location information requests. These events are reported based on HSS reporting, which is a national option. The requirements on the HSS specified in clause 7A.2 and related sub-clauses apply to cases involving non-3GPP IP access and 3GPP AAA servers.

For the ePDG, if it uses a GTPv2 based protocol over the S2b interface, interception requirements are similar to those for the PDN-GW, and interception is based on IMSI. The ePDG not using a GTPv2 based protocol and the AAA server are subject to all requirements specified for PDG and AAA servers in the case of I-WLAN interworking. However, WLAN Interworking specifications are no longer maintained for Release 12 onwards.

In summary, lawful interception in 3GPP networks requires careful consideration of the roles and requirements for PDN-GW, S-GW, ePDG, and HSS, with a focus on using IMSI and NAI identifiers for interception, delivering CC and IRI with correlation numbers, and adhering to national options for interception.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of interception requirements for PDN-GW in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios.
  - Description of the identifiers used for interception (IMSI and NAI) and recommendations.
  - Details on the delivery process of CC and IRI, including the use of correlation numbers.
  - Specific events that constitute Intercept Related Information (IRI).
  - National options for interception at PDN-GW, S-GW, and HSS.
  - Functional requirements for ePDG using GTPv2 protocol."
Describe the encoding and handling of Facility Information Elements (IE) within SETUP messages for call-related supplementary service procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.010.,"The encoding and handling of Facility Information Elements (IE) within SETUP messages for call-related supplementary service procedures are crucial for ensuring proper communication between the mobile station and the network. According to 3GPP TS 24.010, the Facility IE is used in call control messages to transport supplementary service information elements. There are three encoding methods for the Facility IE: simple recall alignment, advanced recall alignment, and recall alignment not essential.

When a supplementary service invoke component is included within a SETUP message, the originating mobile station must encode the Facility IE identifier according to one of these three methods. The encoding of the Facility IE within the SETUP message for different supplementary services is detailed in Table 2.1 of the specification.

The handling of Facility and SS Version IE received in the CC_ESTABLISHMENT message follows specific rules based on the type of recall alignment. If the Facility IEI coding is 'simple recall alignment,' the mobile station copies the Facility IE and SS Version IE from the set-up container to the SETUP message without verifying or modifying the contents. For 'advanced recall alignment,' the mobile station examines the SS Version IE and attempts to decode the Facility IE. If successful and supported, the mobile station copies the Facility IE and SS Version IE to the SETUP message and stores relevant supplementary service information. If unsuccessful, the call is rejected.

For 'recall alignment not essential,' the mobile station examines the SS Version IE and attempts to decode the Facility IE. If successful and supported, the Facility IE and SS Version IE are copied into the SETUP message, and relevant information is stored. If unsuccessful, the SS Version IE and Facility IE are discarded.

Additionally, a mobile station may include a Facility IE without an associated SS Version IE, indicating that the supplementary service operation is encoded using Phase 1 protocols. This flexibility ensures compatibility with older protocol versions while maintaining the integrity of the communication process.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of Facility IE in call control messages for supplementary services.
  - The three encoding methods for Facility IE (simple recall alignment, advanced recall alignment, recall alignment not essential).
  - How the mobile station handles Facility and SS Version IE based on the type of recall alignment.
  - The conditions under which the Facility IE and SS Version IE are copied or discarded in the SETUP message.
  - The significance of including a Facility IE without an SS Version IE, indicating Phase 1 protocol encoding."
Describe the key elements and functions of the RRC messages involved in Inter-RAT Handover as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331.,"The RRC messages involved in Inter-RAT Handover as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 serve distinct purposes and functions. 

Firstly, the message sent on the RRC connection before the Inter-RAT Handover is executed indicates that the User Equipment (UE) has failed to seize the new channel in the other system. This message is characterized by the following elements:
- RLC-SAP type: AM (Acknowledged Mode)
- Logical channel: DCCH (Dedicated Control Channel)
- Direction: UE to UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network)

Secondly, the RRC message sent between network nodes is used to transfer the actual handover command, including the details of the radio configuration to be used upon handover to UTRAN. This message is compiled by the target Radio Network Controller (RNC) and is directed from the target RNC to the source Radio Access Technology (RAT). It is exactly the same as the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND defined in subclause 10.2.16a.

Together, these messages ensure the proper execution and management of Inter-RAT Handover, facilitating seamless transitions between different radio access technologies.","The answer should include the purpose and function of the RRC message sent before Inter-RAT Handover, specifying the failure indication, RLC-SAP type (AM), logical channel (DCCH), and direction (UE to UTRAN). Additionally, it should cover the RRC message sent between network nodes for transferring the handover command, detailing the radio configuration, direction (target RNC to source RAT), and its equivalence to the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND defined in subclause 10.2.16a."
Describe the conditions under which a UE can request policy provisioning for ProSeP and V2X from the PCF.,"A UE can request policy provisioning for ProSeP from the PCF under the following conditions: if the T5051 timer for UE policies for 5G ProSe direct discovery expires, if the T5052 timer for UE policies for 5G ProSe direct communications expires, if the T5053 timer for UE policies for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay UE expires, if the T5054 timer for UE policies for 5G ProSe remote UE expires, if the T5057 timer for UE policies for 5G ProSe usage information reporting expires, or if there are no valid configuration parameters, such as for the current area or due to an abnormal situation. Similarly, a UE can request V2X policy provisioning from the PCF if the T5041 timer for UE policy for V2X communication over PC5 expires, if the T5042 timer for UE policy for V2X communication over Uu expires, or if there are no valid configuration parameters, such as for the current area or due to an abnormal situation. In both cases, the UE must follow the principles of PTI handling for UE policy delivery service procedures as defined in clause D.1.2 of the relevant technical specification.","The answer should include the specific conditions listed in TS 24.554 for ProSeP policy provisioning, such as the expiration of various timers (T5051, T5052, T5053, T5054, T5057) and the absence of valid configuration parameters. Similarly, it should cover the conditions listed in TS 24.587 for V2X policy provisioning, including the expiration of timers T5041 and T5042, and the absence of valid configuration parameters. Additionally, the answer should mention the requirement for the UE to follow PTI handling principles as defined in TS 24.501 clause D.1.2."
Describe the mode selection preferences for a Generic Access capable terminal as specified in 3GPP TS 43.318.,"A Generic Access capable terminal can operate in different modes based on user or operator configuration. The terminal may support any IP access technology in addition to GERAN, UTRAN, and E-UTRAN radio interfaces. Upon power-up, the terminal always starts in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and follows the normal power-up sequence. After this, it may switch to GAN mode based on the mode selection preference.

The mode selection preferences are as follows:

1. **GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-only**: The terminal remains in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and does not switch to GAN mode.

2. **GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred**: The terminal stays in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode as long as a suitable cell is available. If no suitable cell is found and the terminal has successfully registered with a GANC over the IP network, it switches to GAN mode. The terminal returns to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode when it finds a suitable cell or loses connectivity with the GANC.

3. **GAN-preferred**: The terminal switches to GAN mode after successful registration with the GAN over the IP network and stays in this mode as long as GAN is available. It switches back to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode if it deregisters or loses connectivity with the GAN.

4. **GAN-only**: The terminal switches to GAN mode after the initial power-up sequence in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode to obtain cellular network information, excluding (G)MM procedures with the core network. During the initial power-up sequence, the terminal ignores paging messages received through the GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN network.

The RR entity in the terminal plays a crucial role in managing these mode transitions based on the availability of suitable cells and connectivity status with the GAN.","The answer must include a detailed description of the four mode preferences for a Generic Access capable terminal: GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-only, GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred, GAN-preferred, and GAN-only. It should explain the initial power-up sequence in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and the conditions under which the terminal switches to GAN mode based on user or operator configuration. The answer should also mention the role of the RR entity and the handling of paging messages during the initial power-up sequence."
Describe the process and key elements involved in subscribing and notifying HD Map Dynamic Information in the context of V2X applications as per 3GPP TS 29.486 specifications.,"The process of subscribing and notifying HD Map Dynamic Information in the context of V2X applications as per 3GPP TS 29.486 specifications involves several key steps and elements:

1. **Subscription Process:**
   - The NF service consumer (e.g., V2X application-specific server) initiates the subscription process by sending an HTTP POST request to create an 'Individual HdMap DynamicInfo Subscription' resource.
   - The POST request must include the HdMapDynamicInfoData data structure in the payload body, which contains the following attributes:
     - `notifUri`: The notification URI.
     - `ueId`: The V2X UE ID.
     - `range`: Application-defined proximity range information.
   - Upon receiving the POST request, the VAE Server performs an authorization check based on the provided information. If authorized, the VAE Server creates a new resource representing the 'Individual HdMap DynamicInfo Subscription' and responds with a 201 Created message. This response includes a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource.

2. **Resource URI Format:**
   - The resource URI for accessing the subscription is formatted as `{apiRoot}/vae-hdmap-dynamic-info/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`, where `subscriptionId` is a unique identifier created by the VAE Server.

3. **Deletion Process:**
   - To delete a subscription, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request to the VAE Server using the URI of the subscription resource.
   - The VAE Server checks if the resource exists and, if so, deletes it and responds with a 204 No Content success message. If errors occur during the POST or DELETE requests, the VAE Server applies error handling procedures as specified in the relevant clauses.

4. **Notification Process:**
   - When the VAE Server has prepared the HD map dynamic information, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `notifUri` provided by the NF service consumer. The request body includes the HdMapDynamicInfoNotification data structure with the following attributes:
     - `resourceUri`: The URI of the Individual HdMap DynamicInfo Subscription related to the notification.
     - `hdMapDynaInfo`: The HD map dynamic information.
   - Upon receiving the POST request, if the NF service consumer successfully processes and accepts it, they respond with a 204 No Content HTTP response. If errors occur, the VAE Server sends an HTTP error response as specified in the error handling procedures.

These steps ensure a structured and secure process for subscribing to and notifying HD Map Dynamic Information in V2X applications.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The initial subscription process, including the POST request and required attributes (notifUri, ueId, range).
- The authorization and resource creation process by the VAE Server.
- The format and variables of the resource URI for accessing the subscription.
- The procedure for deleting a subscription and handling errors.
- The notification process, including the POST request and required attributes (resourceUri, hdMapDynaInfo).
- The handling of HTTP responses for successful and erroneous notifications."
"Describe the network selection process for UEs in SNPN Access Mode and without SNPN Access Mode, including the role of Home SP and Supported SNPN List.","The network selection process for User Equipment (UE) varies depending on whether the UE is in SNPN Access Mode or not. 

When the UE is configured by the Home Service Provider (Home SP), it receives a subscriber identifier, credentials, and a Supported SNPN List. The Supported SNPN List contains identifiers of SNPNs that the UE can access using its Home SP subscription. This list is prioritized, with the first listed SNPN ID having the highest priority. The Home SP itself has a higher priority than any of the Supported SNPNs. The Supported SNPN List can be updated by the Home SP via mechanisms defined in TS 23.122 or TS 23.502.

Definitions:
- Home SP: A service provider that owns the UE subscription. It can be a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or a Standalone Non-Public Network (SNPN).
- Supported SNPN: An SNPN that the UE can access using its Home SP subscription, even though the UE does not have a direct subscription to it.
- Supported SNPN List: A list of one or more Supported SNPN identifiers that the UE is allowed to access using its Home SP subscription.
- Home SP indication: An indication broadcast by an SNPN cell informing whether access to this cell is allowed for UEs using their Home SP subscription.

Network Selection without SNPN Access Mode:
If SNPN Access Mode is not used, the network selection process prioritizes PLMN selection over SNPN selection. If the Home SP is a PLMN, the UE follows PLMN selection rules. If no suitable PLMN cell is found, the UE attempts to camp on the highest priority Supported SNPN cell. If the Home SP is an SNPN, the UE first attempts to camp on a suitable cell of the Home SP SNPN. If unsuccessful, it then tries the highest priority Supported SNPN cell. If no suitable cell is found in either case, the UE attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service state.

Network Selection with SNPN Access Mode:
For Single Radio UEs, if the UE is in SNPN Access Mode, it follows specific rules based on whether the Home SP is a PLMN or an SNPN. If the Home SP is a PLMN, the UE attempts to camp on the highest priority Supported SNPN cell. If the Home SP is an SNPN, the UE first attempts to camp on a suitable cell of the Home SP SNPN, then on the highest priority Supported SNPN cell if necessary. If no suitable cell is found, the UE attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service state.

For Dual Radio UEs capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a PLMN, the network selection is performed as per Annex D4 of TS 23.501, with the UE selecting the SNPN based on the Supported SNPN List if it decides to use SNPN for its services. The UE is not allowed to use the same subscription to be registered via 3GPP access on both SNPN and PLMN networks simultaneously.

In summary, the network selection process involves prioritizing the Home SP and the Supported SNPN List, with specific rules depending on whether SNPN Access Mode is used or not.","The answer should include:
- Explanation of UE configuration by Home SP, including subscriber identifier, credentials, and Supported SNPN List.
- Definitions of Home SP, Supported SNPN, Supported SNPN List, and Home SP indication.
- Detailed network selection process without SNPN Access Mode, prioritizing PLMN selection first and then SNPN selection.
- Detailed network selection process with SNPN Access Mode, including steps for Single Radio and Dual Radio UEs.
- Mention of the priority order in the Supported SNPN List and the role of Home SP."
Compare the emission measurement procedures for repeaters as specified in TS 25.143 9.1.2.4.2 and TS 25.143 9.2.4.2. Highlight the differences and similarities in the steps involved.,"The emission measurement procedures for repeaters as specified in TS 25.143 9.1.2.4.2 and TS 25.143 9.2.4.2 share several similarities and have a few key differences. 

Similarities:
1. Both procedures start by setting the repeater to maximum gain.
2. Both require setting the signal generator(s) to generate signals according to test model 1, at levels that produce the manufacturer-specified maximum output power at maximum gain.
3. Both procedures involve measuring the emission at specified frequencies with specified measurement bandwidths and ensuring that the measured values do not exceed the specified values.
4. Both procedures include a step to increase the power by 10 dB compared to the level obtained in the initial measurement and then re-measuring the emissions.
5. Both procedures have steps to handle multiple channels if the pass band corresponds to more than two consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels.
6. Both procedures end with switching off the signal generator and measuring emissions again.

Differences:
1. TS 25.143 9.2.4.2 includes an additional step (step 3) that requires configuring the detecting device with a measurement bandwidth as stated in the tables, which is not mentioned in TS 25.143 9.1.2.4.2.
2. The sequence of steps in TS 25.143 9.2.4.2 includes an extra step (step 9) for measuring emissions after switching off the signal generator, whereas TS 25.143 9.1.2.4.2 ends with step 8.

Overall, while the core steps of setting up the repeater, generating signals, measuring emissions, and handling multiple channels are consistent between the two procedures, TS 25.143 9.2.4.2 includes additional details for configuring the detecting device and an extra measurement step after switching off the signal generator.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Both procedures start with setting the repeater to maximum gain and generating signals according to test model 1.
- Both documents specify measuring emissions at specified frequencies and bandwidths.
- Both procedures involve increasing the power by 10 dB and re-measuring emissions.
- Both procedures include steps for handling multiple channels if the pass band corresponds to more than two consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels.
- Document 2 includes an additional step for configuring the detecting device with a measurement bandwidth as stated in the tables.
- Both procedures end with switching off the signal generator and measuring emissions again."
What are the procedures and requirements for handling capability updates and termination heartbeat indications between the MGW and the (G)MSC server?,"The procedures and requirements for handling capability updates and termination heartbeat indications between the Media Gateway (MGW) and the (G)MSC server are outlined in several subclauses of 3GPP TS 23.205.

For capability updates, the MGW reports changes in the capabilities of distinct objects within the MGW. These objects, which can be addressed, are listed in 3GPP TS 29.232. The (G)MSC server can use the Audit Value and/or Audit Capability procedures to obtain further information about the objects whose capabilities have changed. This allows the (G)MSC server to stay updated on the current capabilities of the MGW and ensure proper functionality.

Regarding termination heartbeat indications, when requesting new ephemeral bearer terminations, the (G)MSC server must request the MGW to periodically report termination heartbeat indications. This is crucial for detecting hanging contexts and terminations in the MGW, which may result from a loss of communication between the MSC-S and the MGW. The (G)MSC server handles termination heartbeat notifications by returning a Termination heartbeat – Indication Ack if the context id/termination identity combination exists in the (G)MSC. If it does not exist, the (G)MSC server returns an error and corrects the mismatch by requesting the MGW to subtract the indicated termination and clear any associated context.

Additionally, the MSC Server and the CS-MGW must comply with the requirements stated in subclauses 10.1 - 10.10 and 10.12 - 10.16 of 3GPP TS 23.205. These subclauses cover various procedures and requirements to ensure proper communication and functionality between the MSC Server and the CS-MGW, including handling capability updates and termination heartbeat indications.","The answer should include details on the capability update process, including the use of Audit Value and Audit Capability procedures to obtain information about changed capabilities. It should also cover the process for requesting new ephemeral bearer terminations, the periodic reporting of termination heartbeat indications, and the handling of termination heartbeat notifications, including the corrective actions for mismatches. Additionally, the answer should reference the compliance requirements for MSC Server and CS-MGW as stated in TS 23.205."
Explain the use of TLS protection and HTTP headers in SEPP communication within a PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 and TS 29.500.,"In SEPP communication within a PLMN, TLS protection and HTTP headers play crucial roles in ensuring secure and efficient message transmission. 

Firstly, the SEPP supports the use of TLS wildcard certificates for its domain name and the generation of telescopic Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) based on an FQDN obtained from the received N32-f message. This is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 clause 13.1.1.1. The telescopic FQDN is a unique label combined with the SEPP’s domain, which helps in securely routing messages within the PLMN.

The custom HTTP header 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot, defined in 3GPP TS 29.500 clause 5.2.3.2.4, is used to convey the target FQDN to the SEPPs. This header is included in the HTTP request originated by the Network Function (NF) within the SEPP’s PLMN to forward the protected HTTP Request message towards the remote PLMN. The encoding of this header follows the ABNF as defined in IETF RFC 7230, and an example of this header field is: 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot: https://example.com/a/b/c.

When PRINS is used on the N32-f interface, the sending SEPP uses the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot header to obtain the apiRoot for the request URI of the protected HTTP Request and removes the header before forwarding the request. If TLS is used on the N32 interface, the sending SEPP replaces the authority header in the HTTP Request with the FQDN of the receiving SEPP and does not change the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot header.

The procedure for generating and using telescopic FQDNs involves the SEPP rewriting the FQDN from specific messages (such as Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Get response, Subscription message, and Nsmf_PDUSession_POST HTTP message) with a telescopic FQDN and forwarding the modified message to the target Network Function or SCP inside the PLMN. When the Network Function or SCP is ready to communicate with another PLMN, it uses the telescopic FQDN in the Request URI or the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot custom HTTP header. During TLS setup, the SEPP authenticates using the wildcard certificate.

In summary, TLS wildcard certificates and telescopic FQDNs ensure secure communication, while the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot header facilitates the routing of HTTP requests by conveying target FQDNs. The handling of these headers varies depending on whether PRINS or TLS is used on the N32 interface, and the generation of telescopic FQDNs follows a specific procedure for certain messages.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of TLS wildcard certificates and telescopic FQDNs in SEPP communication.
  - How the custom HTTP header 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot is used to convey target FQDNs.
  - The differences in handling HTTP headers when PRINS or TLS is used on the N32 interface.
  - The procedure for generating and using telescopic FQDNs for specific messages.
  - The encoding and structure of the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot header, including examples."
"Describe the time synchronization service in the 5G system, including its activation, deactivation, and control mechanisms.","The time synchronization service in the 5G system is designed to ensure precise timing across network functions and user equipment. This service can be activated and deactivated by the Application Function (AF), which plays a central role in controlling the synchronization process.

The service includes several key components:
1. **Authorization of NF Service Consumer Requests**: The Network Exposure Function (NEF) authorizes requests from NF Service Consumers to create, update, activate, or deactivate time synchronization configurations. This ensures that only authorized entities can manage synchronization settings.

2. **Exposure of Time Synchronization Services**: The AF can learn about the availability and capabilities of the 5G System (5GS) and user equipment (UE) for time synchronization. The NEF or directly the Time Synchronization Control and Traffic Steering Function (TSCTSF) exposes this information, which includes lists of user plane node identities, UE identities, and supported capabilities for time synchronization.

3. **Control Mechanisms**: The AF controls the activation and deactivation of the time synchronization service for targeted UEs. It can use service-specific parameters to manage synchronization, which are detailed in the 3GPP documents. For (g)PTP-based synchronization, parameters are specified in clause 4.15.9.3, and for 5G access stratum-based synchronization, parameters are specified in clause 4.15.9.4.

4. **Subscription Details**: The AF can subscribe to updates on the availability and capabilities of the 5GS and UEs for time synchronization. The subscription request may include Data Network Name (DNN), Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI), and lists of UE identities or group identities to limit the subscription scope.

5. **Role of TSCTSF**: The TSCTSF manages the time synchronization parameters received from the AF and controls the synchronization service. It handles (g)PTP traffic by choosing appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and dynamically setting Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Maximum Data Burst Volume (MDBV) according to protocol requirements. The TSCTSF also reports the results of synchronization requests to the AF.

6. **Temporal Validity Conditions**: When activating the time synchronization service, the AF can provide temporal validity conditions, specifying the start and stop times for the service. The TSCTSF manages these conditions to ensure synchronization is active only during the specified period.

Overall, the time synchronization service in the 5G system is a comprehensive mechanism involving authorization, exposure, control, subscription, and management of synchronization parameters to ensure precise timing across the network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of NF Service Consumer requests and their authorization.
- The exposure and control of time synchronization services by AF, including activation and deactivation.
- The specific parameters and methods for (g)PTP-based and 5G access stratum-based time synchronization services.
- Subscription details for AF, including DNN, S-NSSAI, and UE identities.

Describe the test environment and setup for intra-frequency OTDOA measurement reporting delay under fading propagation conditions as defined in 3GPP TS 37.571.,"The test environment for intra-frequency OTDOA measurement reporting delay under fading propagation conditions is defined in 3GPP TS 37.571. The test environment is set to 'Normal' as specified in TS 36.508 clause 4.1. The frequencies to be tested are in the mid-range, as defined in TS 36.508 clause 4.3.1.1, and the channel bandwidth to be tested is 10 MHz, as defined in TS 36.508 clause 4.3.1.

The setup involves connecting the signal sources (SS), faders, and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connector or connectors using only the main Tx/Rx antenna of the UE, as illustrated in Annex A, Figure A.4. The general test parameter settings are configured according to Table 9.3.1.1.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to clause 4.7.2.1. The message contents are defined in clause 9.3.1.1.4.3.

In the test, there are three synchronized cells: Cell 1, Cell 2, and Cell 3. Cell 1 serves as both the OTDOA assistance data reference and the serving cell, while Cell 2 and Cell 3 are neighbor cells. All cells operate on the same RF channel, with Cell 3 being the Cell 4 defined in clause 4.7.1. The assistance data neighbor cell list includes a total of 15 cells, with 13 of them being dummy cells as defined in TS 37.571 clause 7.2.5.

The true RSTD (receive time difference for frame 0 between two cells as seen at the UE antenna connector) is set to 31 Ts (approximately 1 μs) between neighbor Cell 2 and serving Cell 1, and -31 Ts (approximately -1 μs) between neighbor Cell 3 and serving Cell 1.

Describe the test mode capabilities and operations for an EGPRS MS as defined in 3GPP TS 44.014.,"The test mode capabilities and operations for an EGPRS Mobile Station (MS) as defined in 3GPP TS 44.014 are as follows:

1. **Test Mode Capabilities**:
   - The manufacturer must declare the MS test mode capability before initiating the test mode. The possible declarations are:
     a) MS is capable of transmitting a pseudo-random data sequence in RLC data blocks.
     b) MS is capable of transmitting looped-back RLC data blocks (not applicable to an MS in EC operation).
     c) MS is capable of both a) and b).
   - An EGPRS MS must also support the EGPRS Radio Block Loopback Mode.

2. **EGPRS Switched Radio Block Loopback Mode**:
   - This mode must be supported by an EGPRS MS and is designed for Bit Error Rate (BER) testing. It involves a Physical RF layer loopback performed before channel decoding.
   - The loopback path is defined in the specification, and the mode includes two sub-modes: Radio Block Loopback ON and Radio Block Loopback OFF.
   - When initiated, the MS enters the Radio Block Loopback ON sub-mode, where it receives all radio blocks and sends them back to the SS using the same uplink resources. The blocks are resent on the next block period regardless of USF or TFI decoding.
   - In the Radio Block Loopback OFF sub-mode, the MS does not loop back any received radio blocks and can send control messages or data following normal procedures.

3. **Initiating GPRS Test Mode**:
   - The MS is assumed to be GPRS attached and in packet idle mode. The SS establishes a downlink Temporary Block Flow (TBF) on one timeslot and orders the MS into GPRS test mode using the GPRS_TEST_MODE_CMD message.
   - The message includes parameters defining the number of PDUs and octets the MS should transmit in the uplink during the test. The SS then starts timer TT02.
   - If the MS has declared capability c), the M bit in the GPRS_TEST_MODE_CMD message determines whether the MS operates in mode a) or mode b).
   - The MS requests the establishment of an uplink TBF in RLC unacknowledged mode, and upon receipt, the SS stops timer TT02 and proceeds with the establishment of the uplink TBF.
   - For an MS in EC operation, the uplink TBF is established in RLC acknowledged mode with a Fixed Uplink Allocation TBF.

4. **Operation of Loopback Sub-modes**:
   - The downlink and uplink TBFs remain open throughout the loopback mode operation, and specific timers (T3180, T3182, and T3164) are disabled to prevent the uplink TBF from expiring.
   - Switching between the sub-modes is controlled by the Payload Type field in the MAC header of RLC/MAC control messages.
   - The MS must obey any RLC/MAC control messages referring to the uplink or downlink TBF, regardless of the sub-mode.

5. **Optional Extension for Production Tests**:
   - The MS may optionally implement an extension to handle multiple timeslots during production tests.
   - If the downlink TBF is established on more than one timeslot, the MS transmits radio blocks received on each downlink timeslot to the corresponding uplink timeslot.
   - If more transmit timeslots are present than receive timeslots, the contents of the extra uplink timeslots are the same as the last mapped downlink timeslot.
   - If the downlink TBF contains only a single timeslot, the MS fills all uplink timeslots as defined in the specification.

These capabilities and operations ensure that the EGPRS MS can effectively perform test modes for various testing and production purposes.","The answer should include the different test mode capabilities an MS can declare, the specifics of EGPRS Switched Radio Block Loopback mode, the procedure for initiating GPRS test mode, the operation of loopback sub-modes, and the optional extension for handling multiple timeslots during production tests."
"Describe the process and parameters involved in playing a sequence of tones in a GSM network, including both fixed and variable sequences, as specified in 3GPP documents.","In a GSM network, the process of playing a sequence of tones can involve either fixed or variable sequences, as specified in 3GPP documents.

For a fixed sequence of tones, the gsmSSF (GSM Service Switching Function) is instructed to play a single sequence of three tones. Each tone has a duration of 200 milliseconds, with an intertone interval of 200 milliseconds. This sequence is played 30 seconds before the end of a call period.

For a variable sequence of tones, the gsmSCF (GSM Service Control Function) provides detailed instructions on the number of tones per burst, the number of bursts to be played, the tone duration, the interval between tones, and the interval between bursts. Additionally, the gsmSCF specifies the warning time before the call period expiry at which the playing of the burst list should start. This is represented graphically in Figure 4.97 of the relevant document.

The gsmSCF is responsible for scheduling these tones carefully to avoid playing tone bursts in close succession to the same party or group of parties, especially when warning tones have been scheduled using the Apply Charging information flow.

Furthermore, the Media Gateway (MGW) generates the tones using the specified parameters. If the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) requests to generate a flexible tone with a signal type ","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Explanation of fixed sequence of tones: duration, intertone interval, and timing before call period expiry.
- Explanation of variable sequence of tones: number of tones per burst, number of bursts, tone duration, intervals between tones and bursts, and warning time.
- Role of gsmSCF in scheduling and avoiding close succession of tone bursts.
- Parameters for tone generation by MGW and handling of user plane stream in transparent mode after burst list completion."
"Describe the behavior of the UE when it receives a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message that is either unsupported or incomplete, according to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications.","When the UE (User Equipment) receives a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message that is unsupported or incomplete, its behavior is defined by the 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications as follows:

From Document 1:
- If the UE is instructed to perform a measurement that it does not support or that would exceed the maximum number of reporting criteria it can handle, the UE shall:
  1. Retain the measurement configuration that was valid before receiving the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.
  2. If supported, set the IE 'Measurement Identity' in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL FAILURE message to the value of 'Measurement identity' from the 'Accepted transactions' table in the variable TRANSACTIONS.
  3. Set the IE 'RRC transaction identifier' in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL FAILURE message to the value of 'RRC transaction identifier' from the 'Accepted transactions' table in the variable TRANSACTIONS.
  4. Clear the corresponding entry in the 'Accepted transactions' table.
  5. Set the cause value in IE 'failure cause' to 'unsupported measurement'.
  6. Submit the MEASUREMENT CONTROL FAILURE message to lower layers for transmission on the DCCH using AM RLC.
  7. Continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid MEASUREMENT CONTROL message had not been received.

From Document 2:
- If the Inter-frequency cell info list includes more frequencies than the UE's performance requirement allows, the UE shall:
  1. Meet the performance requirement for the first relevant frequencies according to their order in the list.
  2. Optionally ignore the remaining frequencies.
- If the UE receives an incomplete 'Inter-frequency measurement' IE in a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message with 'setup' command, it shall:
  1. Clear all stored measurement control information related to this measurement identity.
  2. Set the variable CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE to TRUE.
- If the UE receives an 'Inter-frequency measurement' IE with 'modify' command and certain conditions are met, the behavior is unspecified.
- If the UE receives an 'Inter-frequency measurement' IE with 'setup' command and certain conditions are met, the behavior is unspecified.
- For inter-frequency measurements for FDD, if certain conditions are met and the 'Inter-frequency SET UPDATE' IE is not received, the UE shall set CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE to TRUE.
- If the variable CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE is set to TRUE, the UE shall act as described in subclause 8.4.1.4a.

In summary, the UE's response to unsupported or incomplete MEASUREMENT CONTROL messages involves retaining previous configurations, setting appropriate identifiers and failure causes, submitting failure messages, and handling inter-frequency measurements by meeting performance requirements, ignoring excess frequencies, and setting configuration incomplete when necessary.","Key details the answer must include: 
  - From Document 1: Steps the UE takes when instructed to perform an unsupported measurement, including retaining previous configuration, setting measurement identity and transaction identifier, clearing entries, setting failure cause, submitting failure message, and continuing ongoing processes.
  - From Document 2: UE's handling of inter-frequency measurements, including meeting performance requirements for a limited number of frequencies, ignoring excess frequencies, clearing stored measurement control information, setting configuration incomplete, unspecified behavior for certain conditions, and storing or overwriting cells to be excluded in non-used frequency detected cells."
"What are the security mechanisms and protocols specified for the F1 interface in 3GPP TS 33.501, and how are they implemented?","The F1 interface in 3GPP TS 33.501 connects the gNB-CU to the gNB-DU and consists of two sub-interfaces: F1-C for the control plane and F1-U for the user plane. To ensure the security of these interfaces, several mechanisms and protocols are specified:

1. **IPsec ESP and IKEv2 Certificates-Based Authentication**:
   - Both F1-C and F1-U interfaces must support IPsec ESP and IKEv2 certificates-based authentication, providing confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection.
   - IPsec implementation must follow the guidelines in RFC 4303 and TS 33.210, with tunnel mode being mandatory and transport mode optional.
   - IKEv2 implementation must conform to the profiles described in TS 33.310.

2. **DTLS for F1-C Interface**:
   - In addition to IPsec, the F1-C interface must support DTLS as specified in RFC 6083 to provide mutual authentication, integrity protection, replay protection, and confidentiality protection.
   - DTLS implementation must follow the TLS profile given in TS 33.210 and the certificate profile in TS 33.310.
   - Mutual authentication over the F1-C interface between the gNB-CU and gNB-DU can be achieved using DTLS and/or IKEv2.

3. **Operator's Decision on Cryptographic Solutions**:
   - The use of cryptographic solutions to protect the F1 interface is at the discretion of the operator. If the gNB or IAB-node is placed in a physically secured environment, this secure environment includes other nodes and links besides the gNB or IAB-node.

4. **Optional Use of DTLS for IAB-Node and IAB-Donor-CU**:
   - The support of DTLS (with mutual authentication) for the F1-C interface between the IAB-node (gNB-DU) and the IAB-donor-CU is optional.

These security mechanisms ensure robust protection for the F1 interface, safeguarding both control and user plane traffic.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Explain the process and conditions under which the MME/S4-SGSN sends a Change Notification Request message to the SGW, and how the SGW handles this message according to 3GPP TS 29.274 7.3.14.","The MME/S4-SGSN sends a Change Notification Request message to the SGW under specific conditions as outlined in 3GPP TS 29.274 7.3.14. These conditions include when the PGW has requested reporting of changes such as ECGI/eNodeB ID/TAI/CGI/SAI/RAI, UE presence in Presence Reporting Area(s), or User CSG information. If the MME/S4-SGSN supports these features, it sends the Change Notification Request message on the S11/S4 interface to the SGW. If the SGW supports the feature, it forwards the message on the GTP-based S5/S8 interface to the PGW as part of location-dependent charging related procedures.

In the current version of the specification, the sender sets the header TEID value to the peer node's Control Plane TEID on the S11/S4 interface or the S5/S8 interface. However, receivers must be prepared to handle messages where the header TEID value is set to zero, which conforms to earlier versions of the specification. In such cases, the receiver identifies the subscriber context based on the included LBI, IMSI, and/or MEI IEs.

Additionally, the MME increments the 'MO Exception Data Counter' by one each time it receives the RRC cause 'MO Exception data'. The MME may defer sending a Change Notification Request message to report a non-zero value for the 'MO Exception Data Counter' based on local configuration.

If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting and if PDN GW Secondary RAT reporting is active, the MME includes the 'Secondary RAT Usage Data Report' in the Change Notification Request message sent to the SGW on the S11 interface. This occurs when the MME receives Secondary RAT usage data from the eNodeB during procedures such as Connection Suspend, eNodeB initiated S1 release, E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT handover, E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT handover, MME triggered Serving GW relocation, and MME to 3G SGSN combined hard handover and SRNS relocation. The MME may also send this report during periodic reporting of Secondary RAT usage data from the eNodeB or as part of an MME initiated S1 release from the eNodeB. The SGW forwards the 'Secondary RAT Usage Data Report' to the PGW if the IRPGW flag is set to '1'.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The specific conditions under which the MME/S4-SGSN sends a Change Notification Request message to the SGW.
  - How the SGW forwards the message to the PGW.
  - The handling of TEID values in the message header.
  - The incrementing of the MO Exception Data Counter by the MME.

"Describe the process for creating and terminating an Individual File Distribution resource in the context of V2X applications, including the necessary HTTP methods, required attributes, and error handling procedures.","To create an Individual File Distribution resource in the context of V2X applications, the NF service consumer (e.g., V2X application specific server) must use the HTTP POST method. The POST request should include the FileDistributionData data structure in the payload body, which must contain the following required attributes: fileLists, geoArea, maxBitrate, and maxDelay. Optional attributes that may be included are groupId, serviceClass, duration, localMbmsInfo, and localMbmsActInd.

Upon receiving the POST request, the VAE Server will perform an authorization check based on the provided information. If the authorization is successful, the VAE Server will create a new resource representing the Individual File Distribution, addressed by a URI in the format {apiRoot}/vae-file-distribution/<apiVersion>/file-distributions/{distributionId}. The VAE Server will respond with a 201 Created message, including a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource. This URI will be used in subsequent requests to refer to the Individual File Distribution.

To terminate an Individual File Distribution resource, the NF service consumer must use the HTTP DELETE method. The VAE Server will check if the resource identified by the URI exists. If it does, the VAE Server will delete the resource and respond with a 204 No Content success message. If the resource does not exist or if errors occur during the processing of the POST or DELETE requests, the VAE Server will apply error handling procedures as specified in clause 6.2.7.

Additionally, the VAE Server uses xMB procedures to create MBMS sessions for file delivery, which may involve partitioning large files or encryption. The VAE Server translates V2X application parameters into corresponding xMB parameters for this purpose.","The answer must include:
  - The steps for creating an Individual File Distribution resource using the POST method, including the required and optional attributes in the FileDistributionData data structure.

"What are the spurious emission requirements for repeaters as defined in 3GPP TS 25.143, including the differences between Category A and Category B limits?","Spurious emissions are emissions caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products, and frequency conversion products, but exclude out-of-band emissions. These emissions are measured at the repeater output port. The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeater's operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeater's operating band, with exceptions specified in certain tables. All requirements are measured as mean power (RMS), unless otherwise stated.

For repeaters capable of supporting both UTRA and E-UTRA, conformance to the UTRA spurious emission requirements can also be demonstrated using E-UTRA spurious emission test methods.

The requirements for spurious emissions are divided into Category A and Category B limits:

1. **Category A Limits**:
   - These limits are defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329.
   - At maximum repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the repeater at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per channel, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the limits specified in Table 9.9.
   - When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB, the requirements must still be met.
   - The requirements apply both with or without an input signal applied.

2. **Category B Limits**:
   - These limits are also defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329.
   - At maximum repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the repeater at levels that produce the maximum rated power output per channel, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the limits specified in Tables 9.10 and 9.10A, depending on the declared operating band for the down- and up-link.
   - When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB, the requirements must still be met.
   - The requirements apply both with or without an input signal applied.

In summary, the spurious emission requirements for repeaters are defined based on the type of limits (Category A or Category B) and must be met under specific conditions of maximum repeater gain and power levels, with or without input signals.","The answer should include the definition of spurious emissions, the applicable frequency range for measurements, and the general conditions under which these measurements are taken. It should then detail the specific requirements for Category A limits, including the conditions at maximum repeater gain and power levels, and the necessity to meet these requirements with or without input signals. Similarly, it should cover the specific requirements for Category B limits, including the conditions at maximum repeater gain and power levels, and the necessity to meet these requirements with or without input signals. The answer should also mention the conformance for repeaters supporting both UTRA and E-UTRA."
"Describe the TSC stream availability discovery procedure, including the request and response information flows, pre-conditions, and API operation details.","The TSC stream availability discovery procedure is used by the VAL server to discover the availability of resources for TSC communication for a given stream specification between target UEs prior to creating the stream. 

The procedure involves the following key steps:
1. **Request Information Flow**: The VAL server sends a TSC stream availability discovery request to the NRM server. This request is detailed in Table 14.3.2.23-1.
2. **Response Information Flow**: The NRM server responds to the VAL server with the TSC stream availability discovery response, as described in Table 14.3.2.24-1.

**Pre-conditions**:
1. Each UE must have an established Ethernet PDU session, and DS-TTs must be connected to the 5GS TSC bridge with traffic classes configured on each DS-TT.
2. The NRM server must have collected the 5GS TSC bridge management and port management information, including bridge delay per DS-TT Ethernet port pair per traffic class.
3. The NRM server must have calculated the bridge delay for each port pair, including ingress and egress DS-TT Ethernet ports, UE-DS-TT residence time, packet delay budget (PDB), and propagation delay for both uplink (UL) from sender UE and downlink (DL) to receiver UE.

**Procedure Steps**:
1. The NRM server receives a request from the VAL server on the NRM-S reference point to discover the connectivity and available QoS characteristics between DS-TTs identified by the stream specification.
2. The NRM server validates the connectivity between the DS-TTs connected in the same 5GS TSC bridge based on the collected management information, identifies the traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs, and determines the end-to-end latency, including UE-DS-TT residence times, PDBs, and propagation delay.
3. The NRM server responds to the VAL server with the stream specification and a list of traffic specifications, including the available end-to-end latency and the traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs.

**API Operation Details**:

How is the channel spacing and RF bandwidth configuration determined for IAB-DU and IAB-MT in different test configurations according to 3GPP specifications?,"The channel spacing for IAB-DU and IAB-MT is determined based on the specifications outlined in TS 38.104 and TS 38.101-1/2. For IAB-DU, the channel spacing is the same as specified for BS in TS 38.104, subclause 5.4.1. For IAB-MT, the channel spacing is the same as specified for UE in TS 38.101-1 for FR1 in subclause 5.4.1 and in TS 38.101-2 for FR2 in subclause 5.4.1.

The RF bandwidth configuration for IAB-DU and IAB-MT in different test configurations is determined using specific methods outlined in TS 38.176:

1. **IABTC1 Configuration**:
   - The IAB RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band is the declared maximum radiated IAB RF Bandwidth for contiguous operation.
   - For IAB not supporting simultaneous transmission between IAB-DU and IAB-MT, carriers are placed adjacent to the lower and upper RF Bandwidth edges.
   - For IAB supporting simultaneous transmission, the IAB UL carrier is placed adjacent to the lower and upper RF Bandwidth edges, followed by the IAB DL carrier.
   - For transmitter tests, carriers are placed adjacent to each other starting from the upper RF Bandwidth edge, with nominal carrier spacing defined in TS 38.174 clause 5.4.1.

2. **IABTC2 Configuration**:
   - All component carrier combinations supported by the beam with different sums of channel bandwidths are tested. For combinations with the same sum, only one is tested.
   - Selection criteria include the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at the lower and upper RF Bandwidth edges.
   - If multiple combinations fulfill the criteria, the one with the smallest number of component carriers is selected, followed by the widest carrier adjacent to the lowest and highest carriers.
   - The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 clause 5.4.1 applies.

3. **IABTC3 Configuration**:
   - The IAB RF Bandwidth for non-contiguous operation consists of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks at the edges of the declared maximum radiated IAB RF Bandwidth.
   - For IAB not supporting simultaneous transmission, carriers are placed adjacent to the upper and lower RF Bandwidth edges.
   - For IAB supporting simultaneous transmission, the IAB UL carrier is placed adjacent to the lower and upper RF Bandwidth edges, followed by the IAB DL carrier.
   - For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is sufficient, additional carriers are placed adjacent to each already placed carrier for each sub-block.
   - The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 clause 5.4.1 applies.

These methods ensure that the RF bandwidth configuration and channel spacing for IAB-DU and IAB-MT are consistent with the 3GPP specifications, facilitating effective testing and operation.","The answer should include the specific channel spacing requirements for IAB-DU and IAB-MT as per TS 38.104 and TS 38.101-1/2.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in the authentication and registration of a user in the IMS network, including the handling of authentication failures and the relationship between Private and Public User Identities.","The authentication and registration process in the IMS network involves several key elements and steps. 

Firstly, enhancements to access security are enabled through SIP Digest, which provides a mechanism for authenticating users and securing their access to the network.

When the authentication of the network fails, the process is specified in detail. If the check of the MAC in the User Equipment (UE) fails, the network cannot be authenticated, and hence registration fails. The UE sends a Register message towards the Home Network (HN) including an indication of the cause of failure. This message is forwarded by the Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) and the Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) to the Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF). Upon receiving the message, the S-CSCF clears the S-CSCF name in the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) if the IMS Public User Identity (IMPU) is currently not registered. The S-CSCF sends a Cx-Put to the HSS to clear the name, and the HSS responds with a Cx-Put-Resp. Finally, the S-CSCF sends a 4xx Auth_Failure message towards the UE indicating that authentication has failed, without including any security parameters.

The assignment and relationship between Private User Identities and Public User Identities are managed by the home network operator. The IMS Service Profile, which is a collection of service and user-related data, is defined and maintained in the HSS. Each Public User Identity is associated with one and only one service profile, and all Public User Identities of an IMS subscription are registered at the same S-CSCF. The service profile is downloaded from the HSS to the S-CSCF and is associated with the Public User Identity at a given time.

Public User Identities may be shared across multiple Private User Identities within the same IMS subscription. This means that a particular Public User Identity can be simultaneously registered from multiple UEs using different Private User Identities and contact addresses. The relationship between shared Public User Identities and Private User Identities, along with the resulting relationship with service profiles and IMS subscription, is depicted in the relevant figures.

In summary, the authentication and registration process in the IMS network involves the use of SIP Digest for enhanced security, detailed steps for handling authentication failures, and a structured relationship between Private and Public User Identities managed through IMS Service Profiles stored in the HSS.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of SIP Digest in enhancing access security.
  - Detailed steps and message flow when network authentication fails, including the actions taken by UE, P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, and HSS.
  - Explanation of the assignment and relationship between Private and Public User Identities.
  - Description of the IMS Service Profile, its association with Public User Identities, and its storage in the HSS.
  - Clarification on the registration process of Public User Identities at the S-CSCF and the handling of shared Public User Identities within an IMS subscription."
What are the key elements and triggering Diameter messages for reporting location information requests to HSS when the target is connected to trusted non-3GPP IP access?,"The key elements for reporting location information requests to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) when the target is connected to trusted non-3GPP IP access include the observed International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN), and the identifier of the requesting node type and network. The triggering Diameter messages for these events are:
- User Data Request through the Sh interface, which involves content related to updating the location from an Application Server (AS) to the HSS.
- Location Info Request through the Cx interface, which involves a request from the Interrogating Call Session Control Function (I-CSCF) to the HSS.

These events are reported to the HSS to provide location information when the target is connected to trusted non-3GPP IP access.","The answer should include the key elements observed IMSI, MSISDN, and the identifier of the requesting node type and network. It should also mention the triggering Diameter messages, specifically the User Data Request through the Sh interface and the Location Info Request through the Cx interface. Additionally, it should clarify that these events are reported to the HSS when the target is connected to trusted non-3GPP IP access."
"Describe the process and key elements involved in obtaining unicast QoS monitoring data from the VAL server to the network resource management server, including the request and response flows.","The process of obtaining unicast QoS monitoring data from the VAL server to the network resource management server involves several key elements and steps. 

The API operation used for this purpose is named 'Obtain_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring_Data'. This operation is designed to request QoS monitoring data of a unicast resource. The known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server.

The request for unicast QoS monitoring data is detailed in subclause 14.3.2.33. According to Table 14.3.2.33-1, the information flow for the request involves the VAL server sending a unicast QoS monitoring data request to the network resource management server. The inputs required for this request are specified in the same subclause.

Once the request is processed, the network resource management server responds with the unicast QoS monitoring data. This response is detailed in subclause 14.3.2.34. As per Table 14.3.2.34-1, the information flow for the response involves the network resource management server sending the unicast QoS monitoring data back to the VAL server. The outputs provided in the response are specified in this subclause.

For detailed usage of the API operation, subclause 14.3.3.4.4 should be referred to. This subclause provides comprehensive details on how the API operation should be used, ensuring proper implementation and integration within the system.

"What are the minimum performance requirements for the Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) algorithm, including the criteria for delay, time scaling, and jitter-induced concealment operations, and how is compliance tested using delay and error profiles?","The minimum performance requirements for the Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) algorithm are divided into three main criteria: 

1. Limiting the jitter buffering time to ensure the lowest possible end-to-end delay.
2. Limiting jitter-induced concealment operations by setting limits on the allowed induced losses in the jitter buffer due to late losses, re-bufferings, and buffer overflows.
3. Limiting the use of time scaling to adapt the buffering depth, thereby avoiding the introduction of time scaling artifacts on the speech media.

To fulfill these requirements, the JBM under test must pass the respective criteria using six different channels, as defined in the document. All three requirements must be met for each specific channel to pass the criteria.

Compliance testing involves using six different delay and error profiles, which span a wide range of operating conditions to ensure sufficient performance for the MTSI service. Each profile consists of 7500 IP packets, formatted as raw text files with one delay entry per line, where delay entries are in milliseconds and packet losses are marked as '-1'. The starting point in the delay and error profile must be randomized during testing.

Additionally, the reference delay computation algorithm in Annex D defines the performance requirements for these delay and error profiles. The algorithm sets a threshold for the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the speech-frame delay, which is shifted by 60 ms. The JBM algorithm under test must achieve a delay lower or equal to this CDF threshold for at least 90% of the speech frames. The delay measure is the time each speech frame spends in the JBM, calculated as the difference between the decoder consumption time and the arrival time of the speech frame to the JBM.

The parameter settings for the reference delay computation algorithm are:
- adaptation_lookback = 200;
- delay_delta_max = 20;
- target_loss = 0.5.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The three objective performance requirements for JBM: limiting jitter buffering time, limiting jitter-induced concealment operations, and limiting time scaling.
- The use of six different delay and error profiles for testing compliance, including the format and randomization of profiles.
- The reference delay computation algorithm's role in defining performance requirements, the CDF threshold, and the specific parameter settings for the algorithm.
- The requirement for the JBM algorithm to achieve lower or same delay than the CDF threshold for at least 90% of speech frames."
Describe the key procedures and elements involved in the BCS and MSG phases of facsimile transmission over PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 43.045.,"The BCS (Binary Coded Signaling) and MSG (Message) phases of facsimile transmission over PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) involve several key procedures and elements as specified in 3GPP TS 43.045:

1. **Frames to be Detected During BCS Phase**:
   - **DIS/DTC**: These frames monitor all operational parameters proposed to the sender terminal by the receiver terminal.
   - **DCS**: This frame realizes the actual message transmission speed accepted by the sender terminal and the relevant message transfer direction.
   - **NSF**: This frame inhibits Non-Standard Facilities if explicitly required by the user Fax Adaptor configuration.
   - **DCN**: This frame initiates the Call release procedure.
   - **CTC**: An additional frame detected during BCS phases that fixes the retransmission strategy chosen by the Fax transmitting terminal.

2. **Synchronization and Buffering**:
   - The Fax Adaptor or PLMN facsimile machine acquires received data bit timing on CT115 from the Mobile Terminal (MT), and the transmitter element timing CT114 from MT is synchronized to CT115.
   - A FIFO buffering technique is adopted to compensate for mismatches between PLMN clock speed and local modem clock speed. This technique helps manage the buffer queue, impacting the overall delay of the MSG phase and T.30 operability.

3. **Handling Non-Standard Facilities**:
   - Non-standard facilities are supported as long as they do not conflict with the standard procedure. NSF frames can be replaced by PLMN specific NSF frames containing a Country Code and a unique identification of the FA manufacturer, encoded as per ITU-T T.35 and national regulations.

4. **Speed Checking Procedure**:
   - Upon receiving DIS/DTC frames, the FA/IWF performs a basic speed checking procedure to verify compatibility between the bit-rate possibilities offered by the called Fax apparatus and the actual Access Rates allowed on the PLMN (2,400/4,800/9,600/14,400 bit/s).
   - If some bit-rates indicated in DIS/DTC are not allowed on GSM-TCH, the indication in DIS/DTC may be altered to a compatible value. If the full set of bit-rates is not compatible, the call shall be failed. If the bit-rates are compatible, no action is taken.

5. **EOL Character During MSG Phase**:
   - During the MSG phase, a single bit pattern, the EOL (End of Line) character, must be detected. This unique codeword is used to control the buffer level in each FA, ensuring proper data transmission.

These procedures and elements ensure efficient and reliable facsimile transmission over PLMN, adhering to the specifications outlined in 3GPP TS 43.045.","The answer should cover the following details: 
  - The specific frames that need to be detected during the BCS phase and their roles.
  - The synchronization of timing between the transmitter and receiver, and the use of FIFO buffering to manage mismatches in modem speeds.
  - The handling of non-standard facilities and the replacement of NSF frames with PLMN specific frames.
  - The procedure for checking speed compatibility upon receiving DIS/DTC frames and the strategies for handling incompatible bit-rates.
  - The detection of the CTC frame during BCS phases and its significance in retransmission strategy."
What are the requirements and conditions for TDD RSRP measurements as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and related documents?,"The requirements and conditions for TDD RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) measurements are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.521 and related documents. The intra frequency absolute accuracy requirements for these measurements are defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.3. The accuracy requirements are valid under specific conditions, including the transmission of cell-specific reference signals from one, two, or four antenna ports, fulfillment of conditions defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity, and the RSRP measurement being performed according to clause I.3.1 for the corresponding band.

The time domain measurement resource restriction pattern configured for the measured cell must indicate at least one subframe per radio frame for performing the RSRP measurement, and four symbols containing CRS (Cell-specific Reference Signals) must be available in all subframes indicated by the time domain measurement resource restriction pattern.

The reporting range of RSRP is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with a resolution of 1 dB. The mapping of the measured quantity is specified in Table 9.1.11.1.3-2, and the range in the signaling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range.

"Describe the process of initiating and processing GPL messages in a 3GPP network, including the roles of the Push-NAF and UE, and the steps involved in handling inbound and outbound messages.","In a 3GPP network, the initiation and processing of GPL messages involve several steps and roles, particularly for the Push-NAF and UE.

A GPL session is considered started in a GPL protocol entity when the corresponding GPL Security Association (GPL-SA) is initialized. For the Push-NAF, the session is initiated as soon as it receives the GPI from the BSF and configures the NAF SA and corresponding GPL-SA. For the UE, the session starts when it receives the GPI and configures the GPL-SA. Additionally, the GPL protocol entity needs to obtain GPL policy information for the session, such as encryption and integrity algorithms. The Push-NAF selects the policy for downlink messages, which is included in the GPL message, and chooses a cipher suite for downlink GPL messages. The UE, if an uplink is present, selects the cipher suite for the uplink, ideally the same as the downlink.

Processing inbound GPL messages involves several steps:
1. Verify that the Ver field is equal to 1; if not, discard the message.
2. If the GPI indication does not indicate combined delivery, proceed to step 4; otherwise, process the GPI message.
3. Retrieve the GPL-SA corresponding to the SAID in the GPL header; if not found, discard the message.
4. Verify and set the cipher suite variable; if unsupported or mismatched, discard the message.
5. Verify the sequence number in the SN field; if already received or invalid, discard the message.
6. Compute the MAC using the integrity algorithm and compare it to the MAC field; if mismatched, discard the message.
7. Update the replay protection state.
8. Decrypt the application message using the decryption algorithm defined by the GPL-SA.
9. Return the application message to the transport mechanism or keep it within the application.

Processing outbound GPL messages involves:
1. Initialize the GPL-SA.
2. Include GPI in the GPI message field for combined delivery.
3. Retrieve the GPL-SA corresponding to the SAID; if not found, stop processing.
4. Set the Ver field to 1, and configure the Cipher suite, SAID, and SAID length fields according to the GPL-SA.
5. Set the SN field to the value of the state-variable SN_s.
6. Encrypt the application message using the encryption algorithm defined by the GPL-SA.
7. Compute a MAC over the entire GPL message and copy it to the MAC field.
8. Increase the state-variable SN_s by one.
9. Deliver the GPL protected message to the next step in the processing chain.

If processing is stopped before completion, an error indication may be returned from the GPL protocol entity.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The conditions under which a GPL session is considered started for both Push-NAF and UE.
  - The importance of GPI and GPL policy information in the session initiation.

"Describe the structure and mapping of bits in the HS-SCCH sub-frame, including the conditions for HS-SCCH type 1 and the information transmitted through it.","The HS-SCCH (High-Speed Shared Control Channel) sub-frame is structured to transmit control information necessary for the operation of the High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). The sub-frame is divided into three slots, with specific bit sequences mapped to each slot.

The sequence of bits s1,1, s1,2, ..., s1,40 is mapped to the first slot of the HS-SCCH sub-frame. These bits are transmitted over the air in ascending order with respect to their indices. Similarly, the sequence of bits r2,1, r2,2, ..., r2,80 is mapped to the second and third slots of the HS-SCCH sub-frame, also transmitted in ascending order.

HS-SCCH type 1 is used when the following conditions are met:
1. The User Equipment (UE) is not configured in MIMO mode and not in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas.
2. The conditions for the usage of HS-SCCH type 2 are not met.

Describe the process and key elements involved in the transition from HQ MDCT to CELP decoding in the 3GPP TS 26.445 specifications.,"The transition from HQ MDCT to CELP decoding in the 3GPP TS 26.445 specifications involves several key steps and elements to ensure smooth decoding and avoid discontinuities. 

Firstly, MC1 is used when the previous frame was decoded with HQ MDCT and the current frame is decoded with CELP. During this transition, the CELP state variables are reset to predetermined values, with specific exceptions. The factor is set to 0.3, and the LSF quantization is run in safety-net mode, meaning no prediction is used and the MA/AR memories are not utilized. Additionally, the previous quantized end-frame LSP/LSF and the quantized mid-frame LSP/LSF are set to the current quantized end-frame LSP/LSF.

In the current frame, several CELP memories are reset to 0, including resampling memories of the CELP synthesis, pre-emphasis and de-emphasis memories, LPC synthesis memories, past excitation (adaptive codebook memory), and bass post-filter memories. The old LPC coefficients and associated representations (LSP, LSF) and CELP gain quantization memories are also reset to predetermined values. The CELP decoder is forced to operate in Transition coding (TC), without using an adaptive codebook from the previous frame. Since the LPC coefficients from the previous frame are not available, only one set of LPC coefficients corresponding to the end of the frame are decoded and used for all subframes in the current frame.

To avoid discontinuities at the output sampling rate between the decoded HQ MDCT signal in the previous frame and the decoded CELP signal (including time-domain BWE) in the current frame, cross-fading (i.e., overlap-add) is used. The decoded HQ MDCT signal could be windowed to compensate for the MDCT synthesis window, although in practice this compensation is not done. The synthesis of the CELP decoder is more delayed than the synthesis of the MDCT decoder, and this time difference is denoted as D. In the current CELP frame, the first samples are replaced by the HQ MDCT synthesis from the previous frame (D samples). The unweighted HQ MDCT aliased memory is overlap-added with the CELP output.

Similarly to MC1, the CELP memories are either reset or extrapolated as in the encoder. The same cross-fading approach as used in clause 6.3.2.1 is applied to avoid discontinuities between the decoded MDCT based TCX signal and the decoded CELP signal at the output sampling rate.","The answer should cover the conditions under which MC1 is used, the specific CELP state variables and memories that are reset, the exceptions to the resetting process, the use of cross-fading to avoid discontinuities, the overlap-add technique, and the time difference compensation between MDCT and CELP synthesis. It should also mention the reference to clause 6.3.2.1 for the approach used in cross-fading."
Describe the process and alternatives for codec adaptation during handover in A over IP as specified in TS 43.903.,"In the context of A over IP, when compressed speech is transported over the A-interface, codec adaptation becomes necessary during handover if the voice codec in the Um interface changes. This adaptation ensures that the Media Gateway (MGW) adjusts its codec type accordingly to maintain voice quality and continuity. 

There are two alternatives for achieving codec adaptation during handover:

1. **Channel Modify Prepare Message**: This method involves the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) sending a Channel Modify Prepare message to the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) server. This message initiates the codec change process, allowing the MGW to adapt its codec type to match the new voice codec in the Um interface. This approach is detailed in subclause 7.4.2.1 of TS 43.903.

2. **User Plane Inband Adaptation**: The second alternative is user plane inband adaptation, where the codec change is managed within the user plane itself. This method allows for dynamic adaptation without the need for signaling messages between the BSS and MSC server. This approach is described in subclause 7.4.2.2 of TS 43.903.

Both methods ensure that the MGW can effectively handle codec changes during handover, thereby maintaining seamless voice communication.","The answer should explain the scenario where codec adaptation is necessary during handover in A over IP, detail the two alternatives for achieving codec adaptation (Channel Modify Prepare message and user plane inband adaptation), and reference the relevant subclauses (7.4.2.1 and 7.4.2.2) for further details."
"What are the specifications for occupied bandwidth in 3GPP documents TS 36.104, TS 36.141, and TS 37.104?","The specifications for occupied bandwidth in 3GPP documents TS 36.104, TS 36.141, and TS 37.104 are as follows:

1. **TS 36.104**: The occupied bandwidth is defined as the width of a frequency band such that, below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each equal to a specified percentage (0.5%) of the total mean transmitted power. This requirement applies during the transmitter ON period. The definition also references ITU-R Recommendation SM.328.

2. **TS 36.141**: This document references the minimum requirement for occupied bandwidth as specified in TS 36.104 subclause 6.6.1.

This requirement applies during the transmitter ON period for a single transmitted carrier. For E-UTRA intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirement in clause 6.6.1 of TS 36.104 applies for the E-UTRA component carriers that are aggregated. For NR intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirement in clause 6.6.2.2 of TS 38.104 applies for the NR component carriers that are aggregated. Additionally, the minimum requirement may be applied regionally, and there may be regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in this clause. The definition also references ITU-R Recommendation SM.328.","The answer should include the definition of occupied bandwidth as specified in TS 36.104 and TS 37.104, the percentage value (0.5%), the applicable period (transmitter ON period), and references to ITU-R Recommendation SM.328.

Describe the measurement and cell reselection process for cdma2000 1X cells as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The measurement and cell reselection process for cdma2000 1X cells as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several key steps and parameters. Firstly, the User Equipment (UE) must acquire the timing of cdma2000 1X cells to perform measurements and cell reselection. When the measurement rules indicate that cdma2000 1X cells are to be measured, the UE shall measure the cdma2000 1x RTT Pilot Strength of cdma2000 1X cells in the neighbor cell list at the minimum measurement rate specified.

The parameter 'Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbour Frequency', transmitted on E-UTRAN BCCH, represents the number of carriers used for all cdma2000 1X cells in the neighbor cell list. When the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) of the E-UTRA serving cell (or other cells on the same frequency layer) is lower than the 'CDMA2000 1X Start Measuring E-UTRAN Rx Power Strength Threshold' and cdma2000 1X is of lower priority than the currently selected E-UTRAN frequency layer, the UE shall measure the Pilot Ec/Io of the CDMA2000 1X cells at least every (Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbour Frequency) * TmeasureCDMA2000 1X. If cdma2000 1X is of higher priority than the currently selected E-UTRAN frequency layer, the UE shall measure cdma2000 1X cells at least every (Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbour Frequency) * Thigher_priority_searchThigher_priority_measure. The parameter Thigher_priority_searchThigher_priority_measure is defined in section 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 36.133.

Additionally, the UE must be capable of evaluating that the cdma2000 1X cell has met the cell reselection criterion defined in 3GPP TS 36.304 within TevaluateCDMA2000 1X. Table 4.2.2.5.5-1 of 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 4.2.2.5.5 provides the values for TmeasureCDMA2000 1X and TevaluateCDMA2000 1X. The normative references for these requirements are TS 36.133 clause 4.2.2.5.5 and A.4.6.1.1 for Document 1, and TS 36.133 clause 4.2.2.5.5 and A.4.6.2.1 for Document 2.","The answer must include:

"Describe the requirements and measurement intervals for Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) in 3GPP specifications, particularly focusing on the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions, and how these requirements are applied in relay backhaul links and redirection tests.","Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform, known as the error vector. To calculate EVM, the measured waveform is first corrected for sample timing offset and RF frequency offset, and carrier leakage is removed. The waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and amplitude of the Tx chain. EVM is defined after the front-end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage.

For PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions, the basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH, and as specified in Table 6.5.2.1-1 for PUCCH and PUSCH. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot or subslot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol. Similarly, when the PUSCH starting position is modified or when the second last symbol is the ending symbol of the PUSCH subframe for Frame Structure Type 3, the EVM measurement interval is reduced accordingly. The interval is also reduced when the mean power, modulation, or allocation between slots or subslots changes. For PUSCH transmission, the interval is reduced by a time equal to the sum of 5 μs and the applicable exclusion period defined in subclause 6.3.4, adjacent to the boundary where the power change occurs. For PUCCH transmission with power change, the interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the boundary where the power change occurs.

In relay backhaul links, the requirements defined in clause 6.3.4 of TS 36.101 apply, including the ON/OFF time mask. For relay backhaul links with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements in clause 6.3.4B of TS 36.101 are also applied. The transmit ON/OFF time mask test requirements for relay nodes are the same as those in clause 6.3.4 of TS 36.521.

For redirection tests from E-UTRAN TDD to GERAN, specific test parameters and conditions are defined, including timing requirements and success criteria. The UE must begin sending access bursts on the RACH of the target GERAN cell within 1120 ms from the beginning of time period T2. The rate of correct 'RRC connection release with redirection to GERAN' observed during repeated tests must be at least 90%. The overall delay measured for the test is the sum of TRRC_procedure_delay (110 ms), Tidentify-GERAN (1000 ms), TSI-GERAN (0 ms), and TRA (10 ms), totaling 1120 ms. For the test to pass, more than 90% of the cases must be successful with a confidence level of 95%.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Definition and calculation of EVM, including the correction steps for sample timing offset, RF frequency offset, and carrier leakage removal.
  - Specific measurement intervals for EVM in PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions, and how these intervals are adjusted under various conditions such as power changes, multiplexing with SRS, and frame structure modifications.

Describe the procedures and interactions involved in tunnel support indication and data transfer between the (G)MSC server and MGW as outlined in TS 23.205.,"The procedures and interactions between the (G)MSC server and MGW for tunnel support indication and data transfer are detailed in TS 23.205. 

Firstly, the Prepare Bearer procedure is used by the (G)MSC server to indicate tunnel support to the MGW. Based on the received indication, the MGW determines whether tunnelling will be used and selects the appropriate tunnelling method (fast, delayed, or non-tunnelling). The MGW then responds to the Prepare Bearer procedure with the chosen tunnel indication.

Tunnel data is transferred using Tunnel Information messages. When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from a succeeding node, it uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure to supply the MGW with the received tunnel data. Conversely, when the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server forwards the received tunnel data to the succeeding node.

If the tunnel indicator is received in the IAM, the (G)MSC server uses it to indicate tunnel support to the MGW. If the tunnel indicator is received without tunnel data, delayed tunnelling is indicated. If both the tunnel indicator and tunnel data are received, fast tunnelling is indicated. The Establish Bearer procedure is then used by the (G)MSC server to supply the tunnel support indication to the MGW.

Regarding the Nb User Plane Initialisation messages, when the MGW receives such a message before the subsequent Tunnel Information Down procedure, it may acknowledge the message immediately or wait for the Tunnel Information Down procedure before sending the acknowledgement. The MGW uses the same RTP Payload-Type number for the acknowledgement message as was used in the RTP header of the initialisation message. After acknowledging the Nb User Plane Initialisation message and receiving the Tunnel Information Down procedure, the MGW notifies the MSC server about the bearer establishment.

These procedures ensure efficient communication and data transfer between the (G)MSC server and MGW, facilitating the establishment and management of bearers with appropriate tunnelling support.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the Prepare Bearer procedure in indicating tunnel support and the MGW's decision-making process regarding tunnelling methods.
  - The transfer of tunnel data using Tunnel Information messages and the procedures for Tunnel Information Down and Tunnel Information Up.
  - How the (G)MSC server uses the tunnel indicator received in the IAM to indicate tunnel support to the MGW and the Establish Bearer procedure.
  - The handling of Nb User Plane Initialisation messages by the MGW, including the acknowledgement process and the subsequent Tunnel Information Down procedure, leading to bearer establishment notification."

Reused AVPs marked with supported features such as 'Rel9', 'Rel10', 'MAPCON', 'IFOM', 'SADC', 'USADC', 'vSRVCC', 'EPC-routed', or 'NSWO' are applicable as described in clause 5.4.1.

The Supported-Features AVP plays a crucial role during session establishment on the S9 reference point. It is used to inform the destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host supports. During the first request of a Diameter session, the client indicates the set of supported features, and the server responds with the set of features it has in common with the client. Any further command messages must comply with the list of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session establishment. Features not advertised as supported should not be used to construct command messages for that Diameter session.

The base functionality for the S9 reference point is the 3GPP Rel-8 standard, and any feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features AVP should be absent from the S9 commands. When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs should have the 'M' bit cleared and should not be defined as mandatory in the command ABNF.

The Supported-Features AVP is of type grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID, and Feature-List AVPs. For features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP should contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If multiple feature lists are defined for the S9 reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP differentiates those lists.

During the initial request application message, the destination host acts as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229. If the V-PCRF supports post-Rel-8 S9 functionality, the CCR includes the features supported by the V-PCRF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit cleared. If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the H-PCRF supports Rel-8 S9 functionality, the CCA command should not include the Supported-Features AVP. If the CCR command contains the Supported-Features AVP(s), the H-PCRF includes the Supported-Features AVP(s) in the CCA command, indicating only the features that both the V-PCRF and H-PCRF support.

Once the V-PCRF and H-PCRF have negotiated the set of supported features during session establishment, the set of common features should be used during the lifetime of the Diameter session.

The list of Diameter AVPs re-used by the Gx reference point from existing Diameter Applications includes references to their respective specifications, short descriptions of their usage within the Gx reference point, and the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy control, or both. Re-used AVPs maintain their 'M', 'P', and 'V' flag settings unless otherwise stated. Where 3GPP Radius VSAs are re-used, they should be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in RFC 4005, with the exception that the 'M' flag should be set and the 'P' flag may be set.","The answer must include details on the re-use of AVPs from Gx and Gxx for the S9 reference point, exceptions for certain AVPs, the role of Supported-Features AVP in session establishment, the negotiation process between V-PCRF and H-PCRF, and the handling of AVPs with the 'M' bit cleared. Additionally, it should cover the applicability of AVPs to charging control and policy control as defined in TS 29.212."
"Describe the regional and operational requirements for spurious emissions in 3GPP TS 37.104 and TS 37.105, including how these requirements vary based on different conditions and co-location scenarios.","The regional and operational requirements for spurious emissions in 3GPP TS 37.104 and TS 37.105 are detailed and vary based on local regulations, operational conditions, and co-location scenarios.

In 3GPP TS 37.104, regional requirements are specified in subclause 4.4, which states that some requirements may only apply in certain regions either as optional or mandatory requirements set by local or regional regulations. Table 4.4-1 lists all such regional requirements, and additional single-RAT regional requirements are referenced from the present specification but listed in the specifications for the RATs concerned.

For FDD operation, subclause 6.6.1.2 specifies that requirements are applied to prevent the desensitization of Base Station (BS) receivers by emissions from the BS transmitter. These requirements are measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS with common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.

Subclause 6.6.1.3 outlines requirements for protecting systems operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. These limits may be optional or mandatory based on local or regional regulations and are intended to protect systems deployed in the same geographical area as the BS. An overview of regional requirements is provided in subclause 4.4.

Subclause 6.6.1.4 addresses requirements for protecting other BS receivers when co-located with various technologies such as GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NB-IoT, and NR. These requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.

General spurious emissions requirements are provided in subclause 7.6.1, with additional requirements specified in subclauses 6.6.1.2, 6.6.1.3, and 6.6.1.4 for specific conditions, including FDD BS and co-location scenarios.

In 3GPP TS 37.105, subclause 7.6.2.1 provides the general MSR RX spurious emission basic limits. For an MSR AAS BS, the power sum of emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector RX min cell group must not exceed an AAS BS limit specified as the basic limit plus a factor based on the number of RX units. Additional spurious emissions requirements from 3GPP TS 37.104 subclauses 6.6.1.3 and 6.6.1.2 also form basic limits for additional receiver spurious emission requirements. Co-location spurious emission requirements are specified in subclause 6.6.1.4. Conformance to the AAS BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can be demonstrated by meeting specific criteria determined by the manufacturer.

Overall, the requirements for spurious emissions in 3GPP TS 37.104 and TS 37.105 are comprehensive and vary based on regional regulations, operational conditions, and co-location scenarios to ensure the protection of various systems and equipment.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Explanation of regional requirements and their variability based on local regulations, referencing Table 4.4-1.
- Specific requirements for FDD operation to prevent receiver desensitization, including measurement details at the transmit antenna port.
- Protection requirements for systems operating in different frequency ranges and geographical areas, with reference to subclause 4.4.
- Requirements for protecting co-located BS receivers across various technologies, assuming a 30 dB coupling loss.
- General and additional spurious emissions requirements, including references to relevant subclauses for specific conditions.
- MSR RX spurious emission limits and additional requirements for AAS BS, including conformance criteria."
Describe the RF power control and modulation spectrum specifications for CTS-FP as defined in 3GPP TS 45.056.,"The RF power control and modulation spectrum specifications for CTS-FP as defined in 3GPP TS 45.056 encompass several key aspects:

1. **Maximum and Lowest Nominal Output Power**: The CTS-FP maximum output power and lowest nominal output power are defined in a table. The power control levels needed to support downlink adaptive RF power control range from the lowest nominal output power to the maximum nominal output power. The difference in output power transmitted between two power control levels, where the nominal output power indicates a change of 2 dB, should be +2 ± 1.5 dB for an increase and -2 ± 1.5 dB for a decrease.

2. **Output RF Modulation Spectrum**: The output RF modulation spectrum is specified in tables, with a mask representation shown in annex A. The specification applies to all RF channels supported by the equipment and covers the entire relevant transmit band and up to 2 MHz either side. Measurement conditions include zero frequency scan, filter bandwidth, and video bandwidth of 30 kHz up to 1800 kHz from the carrier, and 100 kHz at 1800 kHz and above from the carrier. Exceptions are allowed in certain frequency bands, with specific limits detailed.

3. **Spurious Transmissions and Switching Transients**: Spurious transmissions and switching transients are measured by peak power in a given bandwidth at various frequencies. The bandwidth increases as the frequency offset from the carrier or the edge of the CTS-FP transmit band increases. The measurement conditions for radiated and conducted spurious are specified separately, with different frequency bands for each type.

4. **Power Limits for Spurious Transmissions**: The power measured for spurious transmissions in specified conditions should be no more than -36 dBm for certain frequency bands. Specific limits are provided for different frequency ranges, such as 250 nW (-36 dBm) in the band 9 kHz to 1 GHz, and 1 µW (-30 dBm) in the band 1 GHz to 12.75 GHz. Exceptions are allowed for up to five measurements with levels up to -36 dBm in specified bands.

5. **Residual Output Power Levels Between Bursts**: The residual output power between active bursts should be maintained at or below -59 dBc or -54 dBm for GSM 900, and -48 dBc or -48 dBm for DCS 1800, in any transmit band channel. A measurement bandwidth of at least 300 kHz is assumed.

6. **Definition of Transmit Band Channels**: The term ","The answer must include details on the maximum and lowest nominal output power for CTS-FP, the power control levels and their differences, the specifications for the output RF modulation spectrum including measurement conditions and exceptions, the spurious transmissions and switching transients specifications, the power limits for spurious transmissions in specific frequency bands, and the residual output power levels between bursts. Additionally, it should cover the definition of transmit band channels and the measurement bandwidth."
"Describe the solutions proposed for ProSe communication and QoS support in TS 23.282, and explain the procedure for an authorized user to change other MCPTT users' selected MCPTT group as described in TS 23.379.","In TS 23.282, several solutions are proposed for ProSe communication and QoS support. For ProSe communication, Solution #4 focuses on PC5 group communication using existing group communication mechanisms without changes to PC5 groupcast communication. Solution #5 proposes reusing V2X communication over PC5 and introduces new data unit types such as IPv4, ARP, Ethernet, and Unstructured data types, requiring coordination with RAN WG2. Solution #22 is similar to Solution #4, optimizing group management using application layer mechanisms without changes to PC5 communication. Solution #37 suggests performing group management at the application layer and reusing the Groupcast communication procedure defined in TS 23.287 clause 6.3.2, without changes to PC5 communication.

For ProSe QoS support, Solution #20 proposes reusing QoS handling mechanisms for V2X communication over PC5 and introduces new PQI values for public safety services, which need verification by RAN WGs. Solution #21 introduces new PQI values for interactive services, also requiring verification by RAN WGs.

In TS 23.379, the procedure for an authorized user to change other MCPTT users' selected MCPTT group involves several steps. Pre-conditions include the MCPTT client 1 being provisioned with the target MCPTT user's information and group information, allowing the selected MCPTT group of the target user to be changed. The procedure is as follows:
1. The authorized user changes the selected MCPTT group of another user, and the MCPTT client 1 sends a group selection change request to the MCPTT server, including the target MCPTT ID and group ID.
2. The MCPTT server checks if the user is authorized to make the change and performs an affiliation relationship check based on stored affiliation status.
3. If authorized and the target user is not already affiliated with the requested group, the server performs the remotely change of affiliation procedures.
4. The server sends a group selection change notification to the MCPTT client 2, including the target user ID and selected group ID.
5. The group selection change response returns to the MCPTT client 1.
6. The target MCPTT client 2 is notified about the change in its selected MCPTT group.","The answer should cover the following points: 
  - Explanation of each solution proposed for ProSe communication, including the focus of each solution and any necessary coordination with RAN WGs.
  - Explanation of each solution proposed for ProSe QoS support, including the introduction of new PQI values and their verification requirements.
  - Detailed description of the procedure for an authorized user to change other MCPTT users' selected MCPTT group, including pre-conditions, steps involved, and the role of the MCPTT server in verifying authorization and performing affiliation checks."

"Describe the performance measurement definitions and procedures for radio link management activities as outlined in TS 32.405, including the relation between Iub and Iur interfaces.","The performance measurement definitions in subclause 4.9 of TS 32.405 are based on the specifications outlined in TS 25.423 and TS 25.433. These definitions encompass various radio link management activities, including setup, addition, and deletion of radio links, which are crucial for maintaining network performance and reliability.

The radio link management activities are categorized under two protocols: NBAP (Node B Application Part) and RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part). For NBAP, the activities include Radio Link Setup, Addition, and Deletion, along with their respective request, response, and failure messages. Similarly, for RNSAP, the activities include Radio Link Setup, Addition, and Deletion, along with their respective request, response, and failure messages. These procedures are illustrated through diagrams that depict successful and unsuccessful operations on both Iub and Iur interfaces.

The relation between Iub and Iur interfaces is crucial for understanding the radio link management activities. There are two cases for the Serving Radio Network Controller (SRNC) to request these activities. In the first case, the SRNC directly controls the NodeB and manages the radio links. In the second case, the NodeB is controlled by a Drift Radio Network Controller (DRNC), and the SRNC must send requests to the DRNC to manage the radio links. If the DRNC encounters any issues, it will relay failure messages back to the SRNC.

The measurements for Iub and Iur interfaces overlap to some degree, which is essential for maintenance and failure analysis. These overlapping measurements allow operators to evaluate both interfaces comprehensively and analyze all potential failure cases, ensuring robust network performance and reliability.","The answer should include:
- A summary of the performance measurement definitions in subclause 4.9.

Describe the procedure for handling unsuccessful MT SMS delivery and subsequent UE availability in a 5GC only deployment requiring SMSoIP.,"The procedure for handling unsuccessful MT SMS delivery and subsequent UE availability in a 5GC only deployment requiring SMSoIP involves several steps:

1. **Unsuccessful MT SMS Delivery**:
   - The message delivery fails after the IP-SM-GW has tried all selectable domains. The IP-SM-GW forwards the received unsuccessful Delivery report to the SMS-GMSC.
   - The IP-SM-GW sends a Report SM Delivery Status message to the UDM with accurate results from different domains. If the 5GS-UDR is used, the UDM records the corresponding MWD in the 5GS-UDR.
   - The IP-SM-GW subscribes to the HSS (IMS) for a one-time notification of the UE being reachable again.
   - The HSS (IMS) records the subscription and subscribes to notification on UE Reachability for SMS over IP event at the UDM, using the Nudm_EE_Subscribe service operation.
   - The UDM checks whether UE Reachability has already been subscribed at the registered AMF(s) and subscribes to UE Reachability notification at the AMF(s) if not already subscribed.
   - The UDM acknowledges the subscription of the HSS (IMS).

2. **UE Becomes Available**:
   - At any time after the unsuccessful SM termination procedure, the UE may become available due to registration in IMS. After the IMS registration is finished, the procedure continues.
   - The UDM can receive a notification from AMF indicating that the UE is reachable again or an AMF registration. The UDM checks whether any NF (e.g., the HSS) has subscribed to notification on UE Reachability for SMS over IP events, querying 5GS-UDR if applicable. If the HSS has subscribed to such notification, the UDM notifies the HSS.
   - As the IP-SM-GW has subscribed to the event of UE being reachable again, the HSS shall notify the IP-SM-GW. If the UE is already registered in IMS, the IP-SM-GW shall then send a Ready for SM message to the UDM and the procedure continues. Otherwise, the IP-SM-GW discards the notification message.

3. **Alert Service Centre Procedure**:
   - The UDM checks the user's MWD. If MWD is not null, the UDM sends an Alert Service Centre message to the SMS-IWMSC.
   - The SMS-IWMSC forwards the Alert Service Centre procedure to the SMS-SC.
   - Upon receipt of the Alert Service Centre message, the SMS-SC re-attempts to send the stored Short Message.

This detailed procedure ensures that the system can handle unsuccessful MT SMS deliveries and efficiently manage the subsequent availability of the UE in a 5GC only deployment supporting SMSoIP.","The answer must include the following key details: 
1. The initial steps of the unsuccessful MT SMS delivery procedure.
2. The process of UE becoming available, including IMS registration and UDM notifications.

4. The Alert Service Centre procedure and the re-attempt to send the stored Short Message."
"Describe the process and key elements involved in the Naf_Authentication_Notification service operation as specified in TS 29.255, including the handling of HTTP errors and redirects.","The Naf_Authentication_Notification service operation is initiated by the USS to notify a NF Service Consumer, such as NEF (UAS-NF), when the USS triggers reauthentication, updates authorization data, or revokes authorization of a UAV. This notification is sent using the HTTP POST method to the Notification URI, which is received during the Authenticate service operation request.

The request body of the POST method contains a ReauthRevokeNotify object, which includes several attributes:
- 'gpsi': The GPSI (External Identifier) of the UAV that needs reauthentication, reauthorization, or revocation.
- 'serviceLevelId': The Service Level Device Identity of the UAV.
- 'notifyCorrId': The same value as the 'notifyCorrId' attribute of the UAVAuthInfo data type received in the request.
- 'notifyType': Indicates the type of notification, which can be REAUTHENTICATE, REAUTHORIZE, or REVOKE. If set to REAUTHORIZE, the 'authContainer' attribute containing the authorization data should be included.

Additionally, the ReauthRevokeNotify object may include the 'ipAddr' attribute, which carries the IP Address associated with the PDU session.

Upon successful processing of the request, a '204 No content' response is returned without a response body. If the 'notifyType' attribute is set to REVOKE, the UAS service-related network resources are released.

If the NF service consumer encounters an internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request, it will send an HTTP error response as specified in TS 29.255 clause 5.1.7. If the request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer will send an HTTP redirect response, as specified in TS 29.122 clause 5.2.10. The redirect response will include the URI of the target entity in the Location header field, using either the '307 Temporary Redirect' or '308 Permanent Redirect' response codes.

What are the key parameters and requirements for the E-UTRAN FDD intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment test case as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The E-UTRAN FDD intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment test case is designed to evaluate the performance of a User Equipment (UE) in re-establishing a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection within the same frequency band. The key parameters and requirements for this test case are as follows:

- **RRC Re-establishment Delay**: The delay is defined as the time from the start of time period T3 to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to the target cell for sending the RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest message. The RRC re-establishment delay to a known E-UTRA FDD intra-frequency cell must be less than 1.5 seconds.

- **Rate of Correct RRC Re-establishments**: During repeated tests, the rate of correct RRC re-establishments must be at least 90%.

- **Formula for RRC Re-establishment Delay**: The delay is derived from the expression:
  \[
  Tre-establish\_delay = TUL\_grant + TUE\_re-establish\_delay
  \]
  where \( TUL\_grant \) is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from the target cell, and \( TUE\_re-establish\_delay \) is calculated as:
  \[
  TUE\_re-establish\_delay = 50 \text{ ms} + Nfreq \times Tsearch + TSI + TPRACH
  \]
  with the following values:
  - \( Nfreq = 1 \)
  - \( Tsearch = 100 \text{ ms} \)
  - \( TSI = 1280 \text{ ms} \) (time required for receiving all relevant system information)
  - \( TPRACH = 15 \text{ ms} \) (additional delay caused by the random access procedure)

  This results in a total delay of 1445 ms, which is within the 1.5-second allowance.

- **5MHz Bandwidth Test Parameters**: Clause 6.1.5.5 references the same test requirements as in clause 6.1.1.5 but specifies the primary level settings and test tolerances for a 5MHz bandwidth.

These parameters ensure that the UE can efficiently re-establish an RRC connection within the specified time and with a high success rate, which is critical for maintaining seamless connectivity in mobile networks.","The answer should include the following key details:

"Describe the procedures for IP transport over IuCS and AoIP interfaces as defined in 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 23.231, including the roles of MSC server and MGW.","The procedures for IP transport over IuCS and AoIP interfaces are detailed in 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 23.231, outlining the roles of the MSC server and MGW in managing IP address and UDP port exchanges.

For IuCS on IP, as described in TS 23.205 6.2.3, the MSC server initiates the access bearer assignment by requesting the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. The MSC server provides the MGW with bearer characteristics, including speech coding information for speech calls and PLMN Bearer Capability for non-speech calls. The MGW responds with an IP address and UDP port, which the MSC server uses to request access bearer assignment in accordance with TS 25.413. The IP addresses and UDP ports of the MGW and RNC are exchanged via RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Transparent, the MSC server sends the RNC IP address and UDP port to the MGW using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure. If the IuUP mode is Support, the MGW uses the source IP address and UDP port of the IuUP Init packet from the radio access network for subsequent downlink packets.

For AoIP, as described in TS 23.205 6.2.4, the MSC server requests the MGW to reserve an RTP bearer termination using the Reserve RTP Connection Point procedure before sending the Assignment Request to the BSC. The MGW reserves the AoIP termination and provides the IP address and UDP port to the MSC server, which then requests access bearer assignment using these details. Upon receiving the BSSMAP ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, the MSC server sends the BSC IP address and UDP port to the MGW using the Configure RTP Connection Point procedure.

TS 23.231 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 provide additional procedures for IP transport over IuCS, including SIP-I based Core Network side procedures. The exchange of IP addresses as defined in TS 23.205 6.2.3 applies, and the MGW uses the source IP address and UDP port of the IuUP Init packet for downlink packets.

For A interface user plane over IP, TS 23.231 6.2.3 outlines procedures in addition to SIP-I based Core Network side procedures, with the exchange of IP addresses as defined in TS 23.205 6.2.4.

Compliance requirements for MSC Server and CS-MGW are specified in TS 29.292 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3, which mandate adherence to clauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 in TS 23.205 and coding in accordance with TS 29.232.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the process and key steps involved in subscribing, receiving notifications, and unsubscribing to SCP Domain Routing Information changes as per 3GPP TS 29.510 specifications.","The process of managing subscriptions to SCP Domain Routing Information changes as per 3GPP TS 29.510 specifications involves three main operations: subscribing, receiving notifications, and unsubscribing.

1. **Subscribing to SCP Domain Routing Information Changes:**
   - To create a subscription, the Service Consumer (e.g., SCP) sends a POST request to the URI representing the 'SCP Domain Routing Info Subscriptions' collection resource.
   - The request body must include the callback URI where the Service Consumer will receive notifications and, if subscribing to local SCP Domain Routing Information changes, the 'localInd' parameter set to 'true'.
   - On success, the NRF returns a '201 Created' response with a 'Location' header containing the URI of the newly created subscription resource. The response also includes data related to the subscription, such as its validity period.
   - If the subscription fails, the NRF returns a '4xx/5xx' response, and the response body may contain a ProblemDetails object with detailed information about the failure.

2. **Receiving Notifications of SCP Domain Routing Information Changes:**
   - When there is a change in SCP Domain Routing Information, the NRF sends a POST request to the callback URI provided during the subscription.
   - The request body contains the updated SCP Domain Routing Information and the 'localInd' IE set to 'true' if the change pertains to local SCP Domain Routing Information. An empty map in the SCP Domain Routing Information indicates that no SCP domain is registered in the network or the producer NRF after the change.
   - On success, the Service Consumer returns a '204 No Content' response.
   - If the notification fails, the NRF returns a '4xx/5xx' response, and the response body may contain a ProblemDetails object with detailed information about the failure.

3. **Unsubscribing from SCP Domain Routing Information Changes:**
   - To remove an existing subscription, the Service Consumer (e.g., SCP or NRF) sends a DELETE request to the resource URI representing the individual subscription, which was provided in the 'Location' header of the '201 Created' response during the subscription creation.
   - The request body for the DELETE operation is empty.
   - On success, the NRF returns a '204 No Content' response, and the response body is empty.
   - If the unsubscription fails, the NRF returns a '4xx/5xx' response, and the response body may contain a ProblemDetails object with detailed information about the failure.

The 'localInd' parameter is significant as it specifies whether the subscription or notification pertains to local SCP Domain Routing Information changes. Setting 'localInd' to 'true' ensures that the subscription or notification is specific to changes within the local domain managed by the producer NRF.","Key details the answer must include:
    - Detailed steps for creating a subscription, including the POST request, required request body elements, and handling success and failure responses.
    - Process for receiving notifications, including the POST request to the callback URI, request body contents, and handling success and failure responses.
    - Steps for unsubscribing, including the DELETE request to the subscription resource URI, handling success and failure responses.

Describe the principles and format specifications for modifying PFCP sessions and Information Elements as defined in 3GPP TS 29.244.,"The principles for modifying PFCP sessions as defined in 3GPP TS 29.244 involve the Control Plane (CP) function providing only the requested changes in the PFCP Request message compared to what was previously provisioned in the User Plane (UP) function. When modifying an existing PFCP session, the CP function must include Information Elements (IEs) that need to be newly provisioned, updated with modified values, or removed. Removal of IEs can be done by either removing the entire rule if no other parameter of that rule needs to remain provisioned or updating the rule with the IEs to be removed set to a null length. The UP function, upon receiving the PFCP Request, will add, update, or remove the parameters as instructed and keep unchanged the parameters that are neither modified nor removed.

Information Elements (IEs) have a specific format that includes mandatory fields such as Type and Length, and optional fields like Enterprise ID. The Type field indicates the type of the IE, with values within the range of 0 to 32767 reserved for 3GPP-defined IEs and values within the range of 32768 to 65535 used for vendor-specific IEs. The Length field contains the length of the IE excluding the first four octets. If the IE type value is within the vendor-specific range, the Enterprise ID field must contain the IANA-assigned value of the vendor defining the IE.

PFCP IEs are TLV (Type, Length, Value) coded to ensure forward compatibility. They can be of fixed length, variable length, or extendable type. Fixed length IEs have a fixed set of fields and a fixed number of octets, while variable length IEs have a fixed set of fields but a variable number of octets. Extendable IEs have a variable number of fields and octets, with additional fields present only if explicitly specified. An IE may have a null length, which should not be considered an error by the receiving PFCP entity.

The Vendor-Specific Node Report Type IE is encoded with a bitmask where each bit indicates a Vendor-Specific Node Report Type. The Enterprise ID field identifies the Standards Development Organization or enterprise defining the report types. Spare bits are set to ","The answer should cover the principles for modifying PFCP sessions, including how IEs are added, updated, or removed. It should detail the format of IEs, specifying the mandatory and optional fields, and the differences between 3GPP-defined and vendor-specific IEs.

"Describe the procedures and requirements for the MGCF when handling incoming calls, session modifications, and hold/resume operations.","When the MGCF receives an indication of an incoming call from a circuit-switched network, it must generate an INVITE request. The Request-URI should be set to the 'tel' format using an E.164 address or to the 'sip' format using an E164 address in the user portion, with user=phone. The INVITE request should include the '100rel' option tag in the Supported header field and the 'precondition' option tag if the MGCF supports the SIP preconditions mechanism. The MGCF should not indicate the requirement for the precondition mechanism using the Require header field. Additionally, the MGCF must create a new, globally unique value for the 'icid-value' header field parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector header field, along with a type 2 'orig-ioi' header field parameter to identify the sending network. Based on local policy, the MGCF may add an 'fe-addr' element to the P-Charging-Vector header field and, if necessary, insert a Via 'received-realm' header field parameter.

For session modifications, if the precondition mechanism was used during session establishment, the MGCF must indicate support for the precondition mechanism during the modification. This is done by using the Supported header field in a reINVITE request, an UPDATE request with an SDP body, or a PRACK request with an SDP body. The MGCF should not indicate the requirement for the precondition mechanism using the Require header field. If a reINVITE request is being generated, the MGCF must also indicate support for reliable provisional responses using the Supported header field and follow the SDP procedures for the precondition mechanism.

When handling reINVITE requests for hold/resume operations, the MGCF must send a 100 (Trying) response and, after interacting with the MGW to hold/resume the media flow, send a 200 (OK) response. If the MGCF receives a reINVITE request, an UPDATE request, or a PRACK request that indicates support for the precondition mechanism using the Supported header field or requires its use using the Require header field, the MGCF must use the precondition mechanism for the session modification if it was used during session establishment. If the precondition mechanism was not used during session establishment and the request requires its use, the MGCF must reject the request with a 420 (Bad Extension) response. If the request indicates support for the precondition mechanism, the MGCF should not use it for the session modification. If the precondition mechanism is used for the session modification, the MGCF must indicate support for it using the Require header field in responses that include an SDP body.","The answer should cover the following key details:
1. Steps the MGCF must take when receiving an incoming call from a circuit-switched network, including generating an INVITE request and setting specific header fields.

Describe the procedures for alarm correlation in a mobile network with virtualized network functions as outlined in TS 28.516.,"The procedures for alarm correlation in a mobile network with virtualized network functions as outlined in TS 28.516 involve several key steps and roles for the Element Manager (EM) and Network Manager (NM).

1. **Role of EM in Alarm Correlation**:
   - When a new failure occurs from the virtualized resource impacting the corresponding Network Element (NE) application, the EM can make the alarm correlation based on the virtualized resource failure report sent from the Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM) and VNF application alarms.
   - The EM receives virtualized resource alarms from VNFM, which include details such as AlarmId, affected VNF identifier, affected VNFC identifiers, and FaultDetails (e.g., VM identifier, vNIC identifier, or vPORT identifier).
   - The EM also receives VNF application alarms from the NE/VNF through a proprietary interface, including the corresponding VNF instance identifier and/or VNFC identifier.
   - The EM correlates the received VNF instance alarms related to virtualized resources with the received VNF application alarms.
   - Finally, the EM sends the correlated alarm information to the NM over the Itf-N interface, as specified in TS 32.111-2.

2. **Role of NM in Alarm Correlation**:
   - Similar to the EM, the NM can make the alarm correlation when a new failure occurs from the virtualized resource impacting the corresponding NE application.
   - The NM receives virtualized resource alarms from VNFM via the EM, which include details such as AlarmId, affected VNF identifier, affected VNFC identifiers, and FaultDetails.
   - The EM sends VNF application failure reports of a NE to the NM over the Itf-N interface.
   - Based on the VNF instance alarms related to virtualized resources sent from VNFM and VNF application failure reports, the NM makes the alarm correlation.

3. **Procedure for Virtualization-Specific Aspect Failure Detection and Notification by VNFM**:
   - The EM subscribes to VNF-related virtualization fault reports.
   - When a new virtualization-specific failure occurs and is detected by the VNF virtualization-specific component, the VNF sends a virtualization-specific fault notification to the VNFM.
   - The VNFM creates a VNF virtualization-related fault report as described in ETSI NFV ISG.
   - The VNFM sends VNF instance alarms generated due to changes in the state of virtualized resources used by the VNFs and their constituent VNFC instances to the EM. These alarms include details such as AlarmId, affected VNF identifier, affected VNFC identifiers, and FaultDetails.

Overall, the procedures involve a sequence of actions for both EM and NM in correlating alarms and sending reports, ensuring effective management of virtualized network functions and timely detection and resolution of faults.","The answer should cover the following key details:

- The transmitting and/or receiving bit rate for the reference test channel should be 12.2 kbps.
- Measures should be taken to avoid the effect of unwanted signals on the measuring equipment.
- For immunity testing, the wanted input signal level should be set to 40 dB above the reference sensitivity level to ensure a stable communication link.
- For emission testing, the wanted input signal level should be no more than 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level to prevent strong signal effects from limiting the performance of the measuring receiver.

For idle mode, the following conditions must be met:
- The UE should be camped on a cell.
- The UE should perform Location Registration (LR) before the test but not during the test.
- The UE's neighbor cell list should be empty.
- The paging repetition period and DRX cycle should be set to the minimum (shortest possible time interval).

For RF immunity testing, the test method should comply with IEC 61000-4-3 standards, with the following requirements:
- The test level should be 3 V/m amplitude modulated to a depth of 80% by a sinusoidal audio signal of 1 kHz.
- The stepped frequency increments should be 1% of the momentary frequency.
- Using the max hold detector method, initially an unmodulated test signal should be applied at each test frequency step, followed by the test modulation.
- The test should cover the frequency range of 80 MHz to 1000 MHz and 1400 MHz to 2700 MHz.
- Responses in standalone receivers or receivers that are part of transceivers occurring at discrete frequencies, which are narrow band responses, should be disregarded.

"Describe the Configuration Management (CM) functions and approaches as defined in 3GPP TS 32.600, including the roles of Basic CM IRP and Bulk CM IRP.","Configuration Management (CM) functions and approaches in 3GPP TS 32.600 are centered around the Itf-N interface, which is an object-oriented interface representing all resources of the PLMN network as Managed Object Instances (MOI) of a Network Resource Model (NRM). The NRM is simplified for Network Management (NM) purposes, assuming detailed CM actions are handled by an Element Manager (EM).

CM functions are divided into Passive CM and Active CM. Passive CM provides the NM with current configuration information through notifications and allows retrieval and synchronization of configuration data upon request. Active CM enables the NM operator to change the current network configuration.

There are two approaches to CM: Basic CM and Bulk CM. Basic CM involves singular operations for retrieving and activating configuration parameters over Itf-N from single Network Elements (NEs) or collections of NEs. Bulk CM involves bulk data retrieval and download of configuration parameters, network-wide activation through a single operation, and the ability to revert to a previous stable configuration.

The Basic CM IRP, specified in TS 32.601 through 32.604, provides a single operation style of CM as described for Basic CM. The Bulk CM IRP, specified in TS 32.611 through 32.615, offers efficient mechanisms for uploading current CM data from the IRP Agent and downloading new CM data to the IRP Agent, including activation of the new CM data.

Describe the conditions and procedures for sending an OPTIONS request from a UE to a remote UE according to 3GPP TS 24.279.,"According to 3GPP TS 24.279, an OPTIONS request should be sent from the UE to the remote UE under the following conditions: 
a) When the UE is in a CS call with the remote UE and the received radio environment information indicates that the remote UE and remote radio environment can handle PS and CS domains simultaneously, the received MSISDN plus personal ME identifier plus UE capability version does not match any combination in use by the UE to cache capabilities, and the received IMS status is 'MS is IM subsystem registered' or 'MS is IM subsystem capable and willing to register to IM subsystem'.
b) When the UE is in an IM session with the remote UE and the received INVITE request includes UE capability version plus public user identity plus personal ME identifier that does not match any combination in use by the UE to cache capabilities.

Firstly, the Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP) is used to transfer call control and mobility management messages between the MSC and the MS. These DTAP messages are not interpreted by the BSS, which instead handles the multiplexing of the messages onto the relevant signaling channels of the radio interface and uses SCCP services.

"Describe the load balancing mechanisms for IMS serving network nodes, including the roles of S-CSCF, Transit Functions, and the use of DNS.","Load balancing in IMS serving network nodes is a technique used to distribute workload evenly across multiple network nodes that perform the same functions, ensuring optimal resource utilization. 

For S-CSCFs (Serving Call Session Control Functions), load balancing can be applied to initial registration requests. This process may be managed by an I-CSCF (Interrogating Call Session Control Function) or through mechanisms outside IMS functional entities, such as DNS. In a DNS-based approach, functionality collects load information from S-CSCFs, applies a load balancing algorithm, and provides the outcome to a Dynamic DNS, which is then used implicitly by I-CSCFs. The I-CSCF assigns received registration requests to one of the available and suitable S-CSCFs using a load balancing algorithm that may consider the load information of the S-CSCFs, obtained via management interfaces, proprietary interfaces, or other mechanisms.

For Transit Functions, load balancing can be applied to service requests, such as initial SIP requests. This process may be managed by the IMS functional entity that is the immediate source of the service request (e.g., an IBCF or I-CSCF) or through mechanisms outside IMS functional entities, such as DNS. In a DNS-based approach, functionality collects load information from Transit Functions, applies a load balancing algorithm, and provides the outcome to a Dynamic DNS, which is then used implicitly by IMS functional entities requiring the IP address of a Transit Function for routing a service request. The IMS functional entity assigns received service requests to one of the available and suitable Transit Functions using a load balancing algorithm that may consider the load information of the Transit Functions, obtained via management interfaces, proprietary interfaces, or other mechanisms.

In summary, load balancing in IMS serving network nodes involves distributing workload across S-CSCFs and Transit Functions using algorithms that consider load information, which can be collected through various interfaces and mechanisms, including DNS-based approaches.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The concept of load balancing in IMS serving network nodes.

Describe the criticality information handling in PCAP messages as defined in 3GPP TS 25.453.,"In 3GPP TS 25.453, criticality information in PCAP messages plays a crucial role in guiding the receiver on how to handle Information Elements (IEs) or IE groups that are not comprehended. The criticality information can have one of three possible values: 'Reject IE', 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', and 'Ignore IE'. 

When an IE or IE group is not comprehended, the receiver must act according to the specified criticality information. For 'Reject IE', if a message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with this criticality, the receiver will reject the procedure and report the missing elements using the appropriate message. If the response message is missing such elements, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

For 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiver will ignore the missing IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure, but will notify the sender about the missing elements in the response message. If the initiating message lacks sufficient information, the receiver will terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.

For 'Ignore IE', the receiver will simply ignore the missing IEs/IE groups and proceed with the procedure based on the other elements present in the message.

The rules for comprehension state that if one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for an EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups for that EP in the same version must be considered comprehended by the receiver, although some may remain unsupported. However, comprehension of different EPs within or between standard versions is not mandated, and unsupported EPs may be considered not comprehended, with actions based on criticality applied accordingly.

Reporting requirements for missing IEs/IE groups depend on their criticality. For 'Reject IE' or 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE must be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. When using the Error Indication procedure, additional elements such as Procedure Code IE, Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, Transaction Id IE, and Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE must be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of criticality information in PCAP messages.

"Describe the procedure for testing the throughput of a SAN (Satellite Access Node) as per 3GPP TS 38.181, including the required conditions and performance criteria.","The procedure for testing the throughput of a Satellite Access Node (SAN) as per 3GPP TS 38.181 involves several detailed steps and conditions to ensure accurate and reliable results. The steps are as follows:

1. Place the SAN with its manufacturer-declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the calibrated point in the test system, as shown in the relevant annex.
2. Align the manufacturer-declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN with the test system.
3. Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be tested.
4. Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power from the test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.
5. Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.
6. Set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same operational band as the OTA REFSENS RoAoA being tested according to the appropriate test configuration.
7. Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit the test signal as specified.
8. Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the SAN Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified.
9. Measure the throughput according to the specified annex for each supported polarization.
10. Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OTA REFSENS conformance test directions of the SAN and supported polarizations.

The performance criteria for the throughput measurement require that for each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 must be at least 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, as specified in the relevant annex with parameters detailed in the tables provided.

Additionally, the reference sensitivity levels for different SAN classes (GEO and LEO) are specified in the tables, which must be adhered to during the testing process.","The answer must include the detailed steps for setting up the SAN and test system, aligning the coordinate systems, configuring the beam direction, and ensuring proper polarization. It should also cover the signal generation and power settings, the measurement of throughput, and the requirement that the measured throughput must be at least 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel. Additionally, it should mention the reference sensitivity levels for GEO and LEO classes."
What are the performance requirements and testing conditions for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH?,"The performance requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH are determined by two parameters: the probability of false detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK must be 0.01 or less at PUSCH power settings presented in the relevant table. The probability of detection of ACK on PUSCH is defined as the conditional probability of detection of the ACK when the ACK is transmitted on PUSCH allocated Resource Elements (RE). The probability of false detection of the ACK on PUSCH is defined as the conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when only data is sent on PUSCH allocated RE, where HARQ-ACK can be allocated. Pseudo-random data is used for PUSCH coding and modulation purposes. Tests are performed on one of the REs where HARQ-ACK information was multiplexed on PUSCH. In these tests, data is punctured by HARQ-ACK information in both slots within a subframe on symbols as specified in the relevant subclauses. The amount of resources for HARQ-ACK information is calculated according to the specified subclauses. None of CQI, RI, nor SRS is transmitted in these tests. Tests are performed for one-bit HARQ-ACK information (O = 1). This test is applied for QPSK 1/3 and 16QAM 3/4 modulation and coding schemes, with appropriate fixed reference channels for performance requirements applied as presented in the relevant table. Normal Cyclic Prefix (CP), 2 Rx antennas, and ETU70 propagation conditions are used for this test. A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the Base Station (BS) supports it. For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths, only the tests for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.","The answer should include the definitions of the probability of detection and false detection of ACK, the required SNR for a probability of detection of 0.99, the acceptable probability of false detection (0.01 or less), the conditions under which the tests are performed (including modulation schemes, reference channels, CP, antennas, and propagation conditions), and the applicable channel bandwidths for testing."

"Describe the procedures for reporting radio measurements from Mobile Stations (MS) and Transceivers (TRX) to the Base Station Controller (BSC) as defined in 3GPP TS 48.058, including the basic, extended, and optional pre-processing procedures.","The procedures for reporting radio measurements from Mobile Stations (MS) and Transceivers (TRX) to the Base Station Controller (BSC) as defined in 3GPP TS 48.058 include several key components:

1. **Types of Measurements**:
   - **Downlink Measurements**: MS measures the received signal level and quality from the serving cell and surrounding cells.
   - **Uplink Measurements**: TRX measures the received signal level and quality on the uplink of the current channel.
   - **Enhanced Power Control (EPC) Measurements**: MS and TRX measure the quality on the downlink and uplink for channels in EPC mode.

2. **Frequency and Synchronization of Reporting**:
   - Measurement results are reported in Measurement Report messages sent in every SACCH block (every 480 ms) or at least every second SACCH block (every 960 ms) if SACCH is used for other signaling.
   - EPC Downlink Quality Reports are sent in each EPCCH block (every 120 ms) if ordered by the BSC.
   - TRX reports measurements in MEASurement RESult messages synchronized with the reception of SACCH blocks from MS.

3. **Mandatory Support for Forwarding Raw Data**:
   - The support of forwarding raw measurement data over the A-bis interface is mandatory for both BTS and BSC.

4. **Basic Measurement Reporting Procedure**:
   - BTS reports the results of basic radio measurements made by MS and TRX according to 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 45.005.
   - If an uplink SACCH block does not contain a MEASurement REPort or an EXTended MEASurement REPort from MS, only the uplink measurement results are included with an indication that the MS measurements are missing.

5. **Extended Measurement Reporting Procedure**:
   - Extended measurements made by MS are forwarded to the BSC using the same procedure as regular measurement reports.
   - No pre-processing of extended measurements is possible.

6. **Optional Pre-processing Procedures**:
   - BTS may optionally support some pre-processing of radio measurement data.
   - It must be possible to switch back to the basic procedure if needed.
   - Pre-processing in BTS must not affect procedures on the A interface.

7. **Modifying Pre-processing Parameters**:
   - BSC can modify pre-processing parameters in BTS according to reported communication conditions.

Describe the procedure and requirements for verifying the receiver's ability to achieve throughput in the presence of inter-cell interference under multipath fading conditions.,"The procedure for verifying the receiver's ability to achieve throughput in the presence of inter-cell interference under multipath fading conditions involves several steps and requirements:

1. **Test Objective**: The test aims to verify the receiver's ability to achieve throughput on the wanted signal in the presence of one inter-cell interferer under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR).

2. **Setup Procedure**:
   - **Adjust AWGN Generator**: The AWGN generator should be adjusted according to the channel bandwidth specified in Table 8.2.9.4.2-1.
   - **Configure Signals**: The characteristics of the wanted signal and the interferer must be configured according to the corresponding uplink reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameters in Tables 8.2.9.4.2-2 and 8.2.9.4.2-3.
   - **Multipath Fading Emulators**: These emulators should be configured according to the channel model defined in annex B.
   - **Achieve Required SINR**: Adjust the equipment to achieve the required SINR specified in Tables 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-6 at the base station input.
   - **Measure Throughput**: For each reference channel in Tables 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-6 applicable to the base station, measure the throughput according to annex E.

3. **Throughput Requirements**: The measured throughput must not fall below the limits for the SINR levels specified in Tables 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-6. These tables provide enhanced performance requirements for different channel bandwidths ranging from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz.

"What are the requirements for SLSS transmission initiation and cease delays as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521, and how are these delays evaluated?","The requirements for SLSS transmission initiation and cease delays as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 are as follows: 

1. **SLSS Transmission Initiation Delay**: This is the time from the beginning of time period T2 up to the moment when the UE initiates the SLSS transmission. The initiation delay must be less than 0.84 seconds.

2. **SLSS Transmission Cease Delay**: This is the time from the beginning of time period T3 up to the moment when the UE ceases the SLSS transmission. The cease delay must also be less than 0.84 seconds.

Additionally, the rate of correct initiation/cease delay of SLSS transmissions observed during repeated tests must be at least 90%.

The initiation/cease delay of SLSS transmissions can be evaluated using the formula: Tevaluate,SLSS + SLSS period, where:
- **Tevaluate,SLSS** is the evaluation time for initiating/ceasing SLSS, which is 0.8 seconds for the parameters in this test.

"Describe the procedures and operations involved in the Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS delivery over NAS without SMS Router/IP-SM-GW, including both successful and unsuccessful scenarios.","The Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS delivery over NAS without SMS Router/IP-SM-GW involves several steps and interactions between different network entities, including the Service Center (SC), SMS-Gateway Mobile Switching Center (SMS-GMSC), User Data Management (UDM), SMS Function (SMSF), Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), and the User Equipment (UE). The MtForwardSm service operation plays a crucial role in this process by enabling the NF Service Consumer to send SMS payloads in the downlink direction to the SMSF.

For successful MT SMS delivery, the procedure is as follows:
1. The SC initiates the MT SMS interaction with the SMS-GMSC, following the current procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.040.
2. The SMS-GMSC queries the Network Resource Function (NRF) to find the UDM instance(s) that support SMS SBI interfaces and manage the user subscriptions of the GPSI.
3. The SMS-GMSC invokes the Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM service operation to the UDM to obtain routing information for the nodes available for MT SMS delivery, specifically the registered serving SMSF instances for all access types for the UE.
4. The UDM checks the registration/reachability flags and responds with the SMSF instance ID and indication for SMSF SMS_SBI support.
5. The SMS-GMSC forwards the SMS message to the SMSF using the Nsmsf_SMService_MtForwardSm service operation if SMS_SBI is supported, or via legacy MAP/Diameter protocol if not.
6. The MT SMS over NAS procedure between SMSF, AMF, and UE follows the steps defined in 3GPP TS 23.502.
7. The SMSF sends the delivery report to the SMS-GMSC using the Nsmsf_SMService_MtForwardSm response.
8. The SMS-GMSC updates the SM-Delivery Report Status to the UDM by invoking Nudm_SMReportStatus_Request.
9. The UDM responds to the SMS-GMSC.
10. The SMS-GMSC delivers the delivery report to the SC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040.

For unsuccessful MT SMS delivery, the procedure includes additional error handling steps:
1. The initial steps are similar to the successful delivery, with the SC interacting with the SMS-GMSC and querying the NRF for UDM instances.
2. If no UDM instance is available, the SMS-GMSC may send an error response to the SC.
3. The SMS-GMSC invokes Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM to the UDM to get routing information.
4. If the UDM fails to find the user or no target node address is registered, it responds with an error cause, and the procedure continues with step 11.
5. If a successful response is returned, the SMS-GMSC forwards the SMS message to the SMSF using the Nsmsf_SMService_MtForwardSm service operation.
6. The MT SMS over NAS procedure between SMSF, AMF, and UE follows the steps defined in 3GPP TS 23.502.
7. If the AMF or SMSF fails to deliver the MT-SMS, the SMSF sends an error response to the SMS-GMSC. The SMS-GMSC may re-attempt delivery via another SMSF based on operator policy.
8. If delivery fails again, the SMS-GMSC reports the SM-Delivery Status to the UDM by invoking Nudm_ReportSMDeliveryStatus_Request.
9. The UDM responds to the SMS-GMSC.
10. The SMS-GMSC sends the failure report to the SC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040.
11. The SMS-GMSC subscribes to be notified when the UE becomes reachable for SMS using the Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
12. The UDM subscribes to UE reachability notifications in the AMF and sets relevant reachability flags, acknowledging the event subscription created by the SMS-GMSC.

These procedures ensure that both successful and unsuccessful MT SMS deliveries are handled efficiently, with appropriate error handling and reporting mechanisms in place.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The role of MtForwardSm service operation in MT SMS delivery.
2. The interaction steps between SC, SMS-GMSC, UDM, SMSF, AMF, and UE for both successful and unsuccessful MT SMS delivery.

"Describe the security features related to user identity confidentiality as defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 and TS 33.401, and explain the mechanisms used to protect user identity and equipment identifiers.","The security features related to user identity confidentiality as defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 include user identity confidentiality, user location confidentiality, and user untraceability. User identity confidentiality ensures that the permanent user identity (IMSI) of a user cannot be eavesdropped on the radio access link. User location confidentiality ensures that the presence or arrival of a user in a certain area cannot be determined by eavesdropping on the radio access link. User untraceability ensures that an intruder cannot deduce whether different services are delivered to the same user by eavesdropping on the radio access link.

To achieve these objectives, users are typically identified by a temporary identity known by the visited serving network. This temporary identity should not be used for a long period to avoid user traceability, which could compromise user identity confidentiality. Additionally, any signalling or user data that might reveal the user's identity must be ciphered on the radio access link.

The mechanism for identifying a user on the radio path using a temporary identity is described in TS 33.102 clause 6.1. This mechanism is used in various requests such as location update requests, service requests, detach requests, and connection re-establishment requests.

In 3GPP TS 33.401, user identity confidentiality is further defined, emphasizing the confidentiality protection of the MSIN, IMEI, and IMEISV. The UE (User Equipment) must provide its equipment identifier (IMEI or IMEISV) to the network if requested in an integrity-protected manner. The IMEI and IMEISV must be securely stored in the terminal, and the UE should not send these identifiers to the network before NAS (Non-Access Stratum) security has been activated. However, there are exceptions, such as during emergency attach when the UE has no IMSI, valid GUTI, or valid P-TMSI, where the IMEI may be included before NAS security activation. The IMEI or IMEISV is sent in the NAS protocol, and in some cases, such as the very first attach procedure, the MSIN must be sent in cleartext. When NAS confidentiality protection is beyond an operator's option, IMEI and IMEISV cannot be confidentiality protected.","The answer must include:
  - Definitions of user identity confidentiality, user location confidentiality, and user untraceability from TS 33.102.
  - Explanation of the use of temporary identity to protect user identity and avoid traceability.
  - Description of the requirement for ciphering signalling or user data to protect user identity.
  - Details on the mechanism for identifying a user on the radio path using temporary identity in various requests.

1. **Updating User Information**:
   - The HSS uses specific procedures to update user information to the S-CSCF. This includes updating user profiles, charging information, SIP Digest authentication data, and allowed WAF/WWSF identities.
   - If there are multiple registered Private User Identities associated with a Public User Identity, the HSS sends a single request, arbitrarily selecting one Private User Identity to include in the request.
   - For updates of a Wildcarded Public Identity profile, the HSS sends a single request containing the Wildcarded Public Identity.
   - The request must include the SIP-Auth-Data-Item AVP, Charging-Information AVP, and/or User-Data AVP.
   - The S-CSCF overwrites current information with the received information from the HSS, except in error situations.
   - If the S-CSCF receives unrecognized data or more data than it can accept, it returns the corresponding error code to the HSS and does not overwrite existing data. The HSS then initiates a network-initiated de-registration procedure to assign a new S-CSCF.

2. **Updating Authentication Data**:
   - A request to update authentication data must include the Private User Identity for whom the authentication data changed.
   - If the corresponding Public Identity is registered and authentication data changes, the HSS should immediately push this information to the S-CSCF.
   - If the Public Identity is not registered or unregistered, and authentication data changes, the HSS should also immediately push this information to the S-CSCF.

3. **Updating Allowed WAF/WWSF Identities**:
   - A request to update allowed WAF/WWSF identities must include the Private User Identity for whom this information changed.
   - If the corresponding Public Identity is registered and allowed WAF/WWSF identities change, the HSS should immediately push this information to the S-CSCF.

4. **Updating Charging Information**:
   - A request to update charging information must include the Private User Identity for whom the charging information changed.
   - If the corresponding Public Identity is registered or unregistered, and charging information changes, the HSS should immediately push this information to the S-CSCF.

These procedures ensure that the S-CSCF has the most up-to-date information for providing services to the IMS subscription, handling errors appropriately, and maintaining synchronization between the HSS and S-CSCF.","The answer should cover the following key details:

   - **NE Certificate**: An NE certificate must be created if it hasn't been done yet, as described in clause 5.2.11.

2. **Certificate Creation Methods**:
   - The certificate creation can be initiated using device-specific management methods. According to section 7.2, either the CMPv2 protocol for automatic certificate enrolment or manual certificate installation using PKCS#10 formats can be used. The choice between these methods is an operator decision, which may depend on factors such as the number of network elements (NEs) or SEGs and TLS entities.

3. **Configuration and Informing Other Operators**:
   - **SEG**: If a SEG is added to the network, its policy database must be configured using device-specific management methods. Other operators must be informed about the new SEG, and the SEG policy databases in other networks may need to be adapted.
   - **TLS Client**: When a TLS client is added to the network, local configuration may be required to integrate the new TLS client for secure inter-operator communication. Other operators should be informed about the new TLS client.
   - **TLS Server**: Adding a TLS server to the network may necessitate local configuration to use the new TLS server for secure inter-operator communication. Other operators need to be informed about the new TLS server.
   - **NE**: If an NE is added to the network, its policy database must be configured using device-specific management methods.

In summary, the process involves creating the necessary certificates for each entity, configuring local settings and policy databases, and informing other operators about the new entities to ensure secure and efficient inter-operator communication.","The answer should include the steps for creating certificates for SEG, TLS client, TLS server, and NE, referencing clause 5.2.11 for detailed certificate creation methods. It should explain the need for local configuration and policy database updates for each entity, and the requirement to inform other operators about the new entities. The choice between CMPv2 protocol and PKCS#10 formats for certificate creation should be highlighted as an operator decision based on the number of network elements or SEGs and TLS entities."
Describe the process and requirements for introducing new features in GTPv2 as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274.,"The process for introducing new features in GTPv2 involves several key steps and requirements as outlined in 3GPP TS 29.274. Firstly, any new functionality that goes beyond the Rel-9 standard and requires backward incompatible changes, such as the support of a new message or specific receiver node behavior, should be introduced as a feature. This is necessary because GTPv2 does not support a Comprehension Required mechanism that would allow a sender to force the receiver to comprehend specific Information Elements (IEs) as a precondition for processing a backward incompatible message.

A GTP-C entity must verify that a backward incompatible feature is supported by its peer GTP entities before starting to use it. Features can be generic node capabilities that are supported homogeneously across all GTP tunnels, UEs, and PDN connections, referred to as 'Node Features.' These features are signaled with the granularity of a node on all GTPv2 interfaces, including S11, S4, S5, S8, S10, S3, S16, Sv, S101, S121, Sm, Sn, S2a, and S2b.

A feature is defined as a function that extends the base GTPv2 functionality and has significant meaning to the operation of GTPv2. A single new parameter without substantial meaning to the functionality of GTPv2 endpoints should not be defined as a new feature. If a new GTPv2 message needs to be defined or an existing message needs to be extended over a new interface, it should be defined as a feature. Features are ultimately defined on a case-by-case basis based on the merits of defining an extension as a feature.

Features should be defined independently from each other, meaning that the support of a feature on a given interface should not depend on the support of the same or another feature on another interface. For example, an SGW may support a feature over both the S11 and S4 interfaces, but the support of the feature on one interface should not be contingent on its support on the other interface.

Additionally, a node supporting at least one feature defined in the Node Features IE must support dynamic discovery of supported features as specified in the relevant clauses. This ensures that the features supported by a peer GTP-C entity can be dynamically discovered, facilitating interoperability and efficient operation within the network.","The answer should cover the criteria for defining new features in GTPv2, including the need for backward incompatible changes and the verification process by GTP-C entities. It should explain the concept of Node Features and their signaling across various interfaces. Additionally, the answer should detail the requirement for features to have significant meaning to GTPv2 operation, be defined independently, and support dynamic discovery as specified in the Node Features IE."
"Explain the synchronization status reporting mechanism for dedicated channels in 3GPP TS 25.224, including the criteria for In-Sync and Out-of-Sync indications.","The synchronization status reporting mechanism for dedicated channels in 3GPP TS 25.224 involves the use of synchronization primitives to indicate the status of radio links in both uplink and downlink. When operating HS-DSCH, the configuration of a downlink DPCH by UTRAN is optional. The synchronization status is checked individually for each DL CCTrCH in every radio frame, taking into account all bursts and transport channels.

The reporting criteria are divided into two phases. During the first phase, which lasts until 160 ms after the downlink CCTrCH is considered established by higher layers, Out-of-sync is not reported. In-sync is reported using the CPHY-Sync-IND primitive if any of the following criteria are met:
a) The UE estimates the burst reception quality over the previous 40 ms period to be better than a threshold Qin.
b) At least one transport block with a CRC attached is received in a TTI ending in the current frame with correct CRC.
c) The UE detects at least one Special Burst with quality above a threshold Qsbin.

The second phase starts 160 ms after the downlink dedicated channel is considered established. During this phase, both Out-of-Sync and In-Sync are reported. Out-of-sync is reported using the CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND primitive if all three of the following criteria are met:
- The UE estimates the received dedicated channel burst quality over the last 160 ms period to be worse than a threshold Qout.
- No Special Burst is detected with quality above a threshold Qsbout within the last 160 ms period.
- No transport block has been received with a correct CRC over the previous 160 ms.

In-sync is reported using the CPHY-Sync-IND primitive if any of the following criteria are met:
- The UE estimates the received burst reception quality over the last 160 ms period to be better than a threshold Qin.
- The UE detects at least one Special Burst with quality above a threshold Qsbin within the last 160 ms period.
- At least one transport block with a CRC attached is received in a TTI ending in the current frame with correct CRC.

If the UE detects the beacon channel reception level 10 dB above the handover triggering level, the estimation period for burst quality evaluation and Special Burst detection window is extended to 320 ms. If no data are provided by higher layers for transmission during the second phase on the downlink dedicated channel, DTX is applied as defined in section 4.5. The synchronization primitives may lead to radio frames where neither In-Sync nor Out-of-Sync indications are reported.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of synchronization primitives in indicating the synchronization status of radio links.
  - The optional configuration of downlink DPCH when operating HS-DSCH.
  - The criteria for reporting synchronization status during the first phase (up to 160 ms after establishment) and the second phase (after 160 ms).
  - The specific conditions under which In-Sync and Out-of-Sync indications are reported, including thresholds for burst reception quality, detection of Special Bursts, and correct CRC reception.
  - The impact of beacon channel reception level on the estimation period for burst quality evaluation."
Describe the structure and categories of IRP specifications as outlined in TS 32.150 4.1.2.,"IRP specifications are structured using a three-level approach: Requirements-level, IS-level, and SS-level. Each level serves a distinct purpose in the specification process. 

Level 1, the 'Requirements-level,' provides conceptual definitions and use cases for a specific management interface aspect, along with defining the subsequent requirements for the IRP. 

Level 2, the 'IS-level,' offers a technology-independent specification of an IRP, ensuring that the definitions are not tied to any specific technology.

Level 3, the 'SS-level,' maps the IS definitions into one or more technology-specific Solution Sets. This level supports multiple interface technologies based on vendor and network type and accommodates future interface technologies without needing to redefine the requirements and IS-level definitions.

There are three categories of IRP specifications: Interface IRPs, NRM IRPs, and Data Definition IRPs. Each category is partitioned into the three levels mentioned above.

The terms IOC and SupportIOC are used in IS-level specifications, while the term MOC is used in SS-level specifications. MOC corresponds to IOC or SupportIOC defined in the IS-level specification and is a term defined by ITU-T M.series Recommendations. This structure ensures a comprehensive and adaptable approach to IRP specifications.","The answer should include an explanation of the three-level approach to IRP specifications, detailing the purpose of each level (Requirements-level, IS-level, SS-level). It should also describe the three categories of IRP specifications and how each category is partitioned into the three levels. Additionally, the answer should clarify the usage of terms IOC, SupportIOC, and MOC, including their definitions and how they relate to each other."
"Describe the requirements and considerations for Public Warning System (PWS) User Equipment (UE) when roaming, including security and accessibility enhancements.","Public Warning System (PWS) User Equipment (UE) must adhere to several requirements and considerations when roaming. Firstly, PWS-UEs that are enabled for Warning Notifications in their Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) should be able to receive Warning Notifications from the Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN) that supports PWS when roaming. However, if a PWS-UE does not support the specific PWS requirements of the VPLMN’s PWS service, it may not receive Warning Notifications from that VPLMN. Additionally, regional regulatory requirements can impact PWS functionality during roaming.

Security requirements for PWS are crucial. Warning Notifications must only be broadcast from authenticated authorized sources. When not roaming internationally, the integrity of Warning Notifications must be protected if required by regional or national regulations. If no such regulatory requirement exists, there is no need for integrity protection, and all Warning Notifications should be presented to the PWS application on the PWS-UE. Similarly, protection against false Warning Notifications is mandated by regional or national regulations, and if absent, all notifications should be presented without such protection. These security requirements are subject to regulatory policies, and the authentication and authorization of the source are outside the scope of 3GPP Specifications.

Enhancements of Public Warning System (ePWS) are designed to improve the comprehension of Warning Notifications for users with disabilities who have UEs supporting assistive technologies beyond text assistive technologies, and for users who are not fluent in the language of the Warning Notifications. Requirements defined for PWS-UEs in clause 4, including roaming and security requirements, are applicable to ePWS-UEs unless dedicated ePWS-UE requirements described in clause 9 supersede them. This includes UEs with no user interface or those with a user interface incapable of displaying text-based Warning Notifications.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - The ability of PWS-UEs to receive Warning Notifications from VPLMN when roaming, and the conditions under which they may not receive these notifications.
  - The security requirements for PWS, including the necessity for authenticated sources, and the conditions under which integrity protection and protection against false notifications are required.
  - The specific applicability of these requirements to ePWS-UEs, including those with no user interface or those supporting assistive technologies, and the mention that these requirements are subject to regional or national regulations."
Describe the procedures and requirements for MGW selection and codec handling in SIP-I based circuit switched core networks as per 3GPP specifications.,"The procedures and requirements for MGW (Media Gateway) selection and codec handling in SIP-I based circuit switched core networks are outlined in various 3GPP specifications. 

Firstly, TS 23.231 clause 4.4 describes three MGW selection procedures: optimised MGW selection, deferred MGW selection, and MGW bypass. These procedures dictate how MGWs are chosen and managed within the network.

When MGW bypass is implemented, as detailed in TS 29.235 clause 4.2.2.4, the IWU (Interworking Unit) must handle MGW identifiers in SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers and answers. Specifically, the IWU should remove the MGW identifier from SDP offers received from external SIP-I networks before forwarding them to the succeeding 3GPP node. Similarly, it should remove the MGW identifier from SDP answers received from the succeeding 3GPP node before sending them back to the external network. If the external network does not specify a connection address, it is interpreted as supporting deferred MGW selection, and the succeeding node will select a MGW and may return the MGW identifier to the IWU.

TS 29.235 clause 5.3.1.3.3 addresses codec handling procedures. The IWU should offer codecs known to be supported within the SIP-I based CS CN (Circuit Switched Core Network). If multiple speech codecs are offered, Out of Band Transcoder Control (OoBTC) procedures must be applied by the IWU. If only the default PCM speech codec is signalled, auxiliary payload types such as the Telephony Event RTP payload type may be included. For optimised MGW selection, the IWU must include a MGW identifier in the SDP offer.

Deferred MGW selection procedures are further detailed in TS 29.235 clause 5.4.3.2.4. If the IWU supports deferred MGW selection and receives an unspecified connection address in the SDP offer, it should include a MGW identifier for the IWU-UP (Interworking Unit User Plane) it selects in the corresponding SDP answer.

Finally, TS 29.235 clause 7.2.6 explains the role of the MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function) in MGW selection. If the MGCF supports optimised or deferred MGW selection, it may include the SDP MGW identifier in the SIP message sent to the succeeding SIP-I based circuit switched core network. Otherwise, the MGCF must seize a MGW and include the MGW connection address in the SDP offer of the initial SIP INVITE request sent to the succeeding 3GPP SIP-I based circuit switched core network node.

In summary, the procedures for MGW selection and codec handling involve specific steps for managing MGW identifiers in SDP offers and answers, interpreting unspecified connection addresses, applying OoBTC procedures, and the role of the MGCF in MGW selection.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The different MGW selection procedures (optimised, deferred, and bypass) as described in TS 23.231.
- The handling of MGW identifiers in SDP offers and answers, including the removal and inclusion of identifiers based on the procedure implemented.
- The interpretation of unspecified connection addresses and their impact on MGW selection.
- The codec handling procedures, including the use of OoBTC and the default PCM speech codec.
- The role of the MGCF in MGW selection and the inclusion of MGW identifiers in SIP messages."
"Describe the procedures and options for handling call transfers and diversions in 3GPP TS 33.108, including the generation and handling of IRI records.","In 3GPP TS 33.108, the procedures for handling call transfers and diversions involve several steps and options, particularly concerning the generation and handling of Intercept Related Information (IRI) records.

During the preparation phase of a call transfer, the Call Hold/Retrieve procedures are applicable. If the served user is the target, the original call is released, terminating the Communication Control (CC) link and causing an IRI-END record to be sent. After the transfer, there are two options for handling the transferred call:
1. CC links and IRI records shall be generated similarly to a forwarded call.
2. The transferred call shall not be intercepted.

For call diversion services, two main cases are differentiated:
a) Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU) and Call Forwarding Busy (NDUB): Forwarding is determined before seizing the target access, and CC links are set up immediately for the forwarded call. Other variants of immediate forwarding are handled similarly.
b) Call Forwarding No Reply, Call Forwarding Busy (UDUB), and Call Deflection: Initially, the target call is set up and intercepted like a basic call. When forwarding occurs (e.g., after the CFNR timer expires), the original call is released, potentially causing the release of CC links. Two options for IRI record handling may apply:
   1. An IRI-END record is sent for the original call, and a new set up procedure with new LI transaction and IRI records begins for the forwarded call.
   2. An IRI-CONTINUE record is generated and sent to the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA), indicating the CFNR invocation.

In cases of multiple forwarding, one call may be intercepted several times, with a maximum of 7 interceptions recommended by 3GPP.

During the reconfiguration of a call, ECT-specific information at the target's access is sent to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) within IRI-CONTINUE records. When the target leaves the call after transfer, an IRI-END record is sent, terminating the LI transaction. The options for the new call after transfer follow the procedures outlined in clause 5.5.4.1.

Overall, the handling of call transfers and diversions in 3GPP TS 33.108 involves detailed procedures for generating and managing IRI records, ensuring proper interception and monitoring of calls as per the specified guidelines.","The answer should cover the procedures for Call Hold/Retrieve during call transfer, the options for handling transferred calls, the differentiation and handling of various call diversion services, the generation and handling of IRI records during call forwarding and transfer, and the handling of multiple forwarding scenarios. It should also include the reconfiguration of calls during transfer and the specific information sent within IRI-CONTINUE records."
Describe the verification process for the random access procedure of a category NB1 UE in Normal Coverage according to 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The verification process for the random access procedure of a category NB1 UE in Normal Coverage according to 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several key steps. Firstly, the NPRACH power settings and timing must be checked to ensure they are within the specified limits. This involves measuring the power levels and timing intervals during the random access procedure. Secondly, the UE's ability to determine the enhanced coverage level based on the NRSRP measurement must be verified. This includes assessing whether the UE correctly interprets the NRSRP-ThresholdsPrach criterion to decide the coverage level. The requirements for this verification are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 6.6.2, 6.6.3, and 7.20.2. Finally, the entire verification process is conducted using an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) model to simulate the radio environment and ensure accurate testing conditions.","The answer should detail the steps involved in verifying the random access procedure for a category NB1 UE in Normal Coverage. It should include the NPRACH power settings and timing limits, the process for determining enhanced coverage level based on NRSRP measurement, and the specific requirements from 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 6.6.2, 6.6.3, and 7.20.2. Additionally, it should mention the use of an AWGN model for the verification."
What are the minimum requirements for radiated transmit power in different conditions as specified in 3GPP TS 37.105?,"The minimum requirements for radiated transmit power in different conditions as specified in 3GPP TS 37.105 are as follows:

For each declared beam, in normal conditions, the manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the corresponding beam peak direction must be achievable to within +2.2 dB and -2.2 dB of the claimed value. In extreme conditions, the EIRP level must be achievable to within +2.7 dB and -2.7 dB of the claimed value. Additionally, in certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply to some conditions outside the range defined as normal.

For UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option carrier radiated transmit power, the minimum requirements are the same as those defined in subclause 9.2.2.

Similarly, the minimum requirement for E-UTRA carrier radiated transmit power is also the same as defined in subclause 9.2.2.","The answer should include the specific dB ranges for EIRP levels in normal and extreme conditions as defined in TS 37.105 9.2.2. It should also mention that the minimum requirements for UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option, and E-UTRA carrier radiated transmit power are the same as those defined in subclause 9.2.2."
"Describe the process and API operations involved in subscribing and unsubscribing to unicast QoS monitoring in the VAL server, including the information flow and key inputs/outputs.","The process of subscribing and unsubscribing to unicast QoS monitoring in the VAL server involves specific API operations and information flows between the VAL server and the network resource management server.

For subscribing to unicast QoS monitoring, the API operation used is Subscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring. This operation is described in subclause 14.4.4.2. The known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server. The inputs required for this operation are detailed in subclause 14.3.2.20, which outlines the information flow from the VAL server to the network resource management server for a unicast QoS monitoring subscription request. The outputs of this operation are specified in subclause 14.3.2.21, which describes the information flow from the network resource management server to the VAL server for a unicast QoS monitoring subscription response. For detailed usage of this API operation, subclause 14.3.3.4.1 should be referenced.

For unsubscribing from unicast QoS monitoring, the API operation used is Unsubscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring, as described in subclause 14.4.4.4. Similar to the subscription process, the known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server. The inputs for this operation are also detailed in subclause 14.3.2.20, and the outputs are specified in subclause 14.3.2.21. Detailed usage of this API operation can be found in subclause 14.3.3.4.3.

In summary, the VAL server initiates the subscription and unsubscription processes by sending requests to the network resource management server, which then responds accordingly. The specific API operations, Subscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring and Unsubscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring, facilitate these processes, with detailed information flows and key inputs/outputs outlined in the relevant subclauses.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The role of the VAL server and network resource management server in the subscription and unsubscription process.
  - The specific information flows for both subscription requests and responses.
  - The API operations involved (Subscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring and Unsubscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring), including their descriptions, known consumers, inputs, and outputs.

Describe the key functionalities and procedures related to Proximity-based Services (ProSe) as specified in the 3GPP documents TS 24.334 and TS 31.111.,"Proximity-based Services (ProSe) are services provided by the 3GPP system based on User Equipment (UE) being in proximity to each other. The key functionalities of ProSe as outlined in TS 24.334 include ProSe direct discovery, ProSe direct communication, EPC-level ProSe discovery, and EPC support for WLAN direct discovery and communication. ProSe direct discovery and EPC-level ProSe discovery are applicable to both Public Safety UE and non-Public Safety UE, while ProSe direct communication is applicable only to Public Safety UE. Communication security over the PC3 and PC3ch interfaces is specified in TS 33.303.

For ProSe transactions over the PC3ch interface, the UE and ProSe Function CTF (ADF) use HTTP 1.1 as the transport protocol, as specified in IETF RFC 7230 and RFC 7231. The UE initiates ProSe transactions with an HTTP request message containing the PC3ch requests, and the ProSe Function CTF (ADF) responds with an HTTP response message containing the PC3ch responses. HTTP POST methods are used for PC3ch procedures. Optionally, the operator can configure the UE with parameters for establishing a PDN connection to reach the HPLMN ProSe Function. If the PDN connection is not yet established, the UE shall establish it according to the configuration and send the HTTP request message via this connection.

ProSe usage information reporting involves the UICC storing ProSe usage information to be sent over the PC3ch interface using the ENVELOPE (ProSe Report). The UICC supporting ProSe usage information reporting must also support BIP and is responsible for transmitting the collected reports to the ProSe Function CTF (ADF) using the BIP mechanism. The address of the ProSe Function CTF (ADF) is available in the EFPROSE_UIRC. If the ProSe usage information exceeds 243 bytes, it is split into several ENVELOPE (ProSe Report) messages, with the final envelope indicated by a Last Envelope TLV. If the report sending procedure is unsuccessful, the USIM behavior follows the specifications for the UE in TS 24.334, clause 10.3.2.1.6.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The different functionalities of ProSe as outlined in TS 24.334, including which functionalities are applicable to Public Safety UE and non-Public Safety UE.

"Describe the handover process from NR to UTRAN as specified in TS 38.533, including the timing requirements and conditions for known and unknown target cells.","The handover process from NR (New Radio) to UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) involves several timing requirements and conditions, as specified in TS 38.533. When the User Equipment (UE) receives a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message implying handover to UTRAN, it must be ready to start the transmission of the new UTRA uplink Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH) within Dhandover milliseconds from the end of the last NR Transmission Time Interval (TTI) containing the RRC MobilityfromNRCommand command.

Dhandover is defined as the sum of the RRC procedure delay (50 ms) and the interruption time. The interruption time is the period between the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command on the NR Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and the time the UE starts transmission on the uplink DPCCH in UTRAN, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This interruption time varies depending on whether the target cell is known or unknown to the UE.

If the target cell is known (i.e., it has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds), the interruption time must be less than Tinterrupt1, which is calculated as:
Tinterrupt1 = TIU + Tsync + 50 + 10 * Fmax + TMC ms

If the target cell is unknown (i.e., it has not been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds), the interruption time must be less than Tinterrupt2, which is calculated as:
Tinterrupt2 = TIU + Tsync + 150 + 10 * Fmax + TMC ms

The components of these calculations are defined as follows:
- TIU (Interruption Uncertainty): The uncertainty when changing the timing from the NR to the new UTRAN cell, which can be up to one UTRA frame (10 ms).
- Fmax: The maximum number of radio frames within the transmission time intervals of all transport channels multiplexed into the same Composite Channel Transport Channel (CCTrCH) on the UTRA target cell. If High-Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) is configured in the UTRA target cell, Fmax is 4 radio frames.
- Tsync: The time required for measuring the downlink DPCCH channel, which is 40 ms unless higher layers indicate the usage of a post-verification period, in which case Tsync is 0 ms.
- TMC: The time required for configuring multiple UTRA cells as handover targets. It is 0 ms if a single UTRA cell is configured, otherwise, it is 20 ms if handover to UTRA with 1, 2, or 3 UTRA carriers with secondary HS-PDSCH is configured.

Additionally, the requirements assume that N312 has the smallest possible value, meaning only one insync is required. This assumption impacts the timing and synchronization during the handover process.

In summary, the handover process from NR to UTRAN involves specific timing requirements based on whether the target cell is known or unknown, with detailed calculations for interruption times and definitions for various components affecting the handover timing.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of Dhandover and its components (RRC procedure delay and interruption time).
  - Conditions for known and unknown target cells and their respective interruption times (Tinterrupt1 and Tinterrupt2).
  - Detailed definitions of TIU, Fmax, Tsync, and TMC.
  - Assumptions regarding N312 and its impact on the handover process."
"Describe the testing requirements and configurations for base stations (BS) as per 3GPP TS 25.113, including normal test conditions, test configurations, and immunity tests.","The testing requirements and configurations for base stations (BS) as per 3GPP TS 25.113 encompass several key aspects:

1. **Normal Test Conditions**: The equipment must be tested in a normal test environment as defined in the base station conformance testing specifications TS 25.141, TS 25.142, or the UTRA Repeater conformance testing specification TS 25.143. The test conditions must be recorded in the test report. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements apply to each supported operating band unless otherwise stated, and all bands must be assessed during the tests.

2. **Test Configurations for Conformance**: For demonstrating conformance, BS test configurations are defined in TS 25.141, subclause 4.12. A single UTRA carrier is used for testing single-carrier capable BS, while other BS types use the test configurations listed in Table 4.6.1 of TS 25.113.

3. **Immunity Tests**: The configurations for immunity tests require the equipment to be tested under normal test conditions as specified in the functional standards. The test configuration should be as close to normal intended use as possible. If the equipment is part of a system or can be connected to ancillary equipment, it is acceptable to test the equipment while connected to the minimum configuration of ancillary equipment necessary to exercise the ports. For equipment with a large number of ports, a sufficient number must be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and ensure all different types of termination are tested. The test conditions, test configuration, and mode of operation must be recorded in the test report.

4. **Communication Links and BLER Evaluation**: Immunity tests on the entire base station involve establishing communication links at the air-interface (e.g., with a mobile simulator) and the Iub-interface (e.g., with an RNC simulator) and evaluating the Block Error Rate (BLER). Tests must be performed on both the Uplink and Downlink paths, including both the air-interface and Iub-interface. BLER evaluation may be carried out at either interface, and measurements for the Uplink and Downlink paths may be carried out as a single path looped at either interface. Care must be taken to ensure the BLER information does not change due to looping. For BS capable of multi-band operation, communication links must be established to activate all operating bands during the test according to the applicable test configurations in subclause 4.6, with performance assessment done separately for each operating band.

These comprehensive testing requirements ensure that base stations meet the necessary standards for performance and immunity under various conditions.","The answer should include details on the normal test environment and conditions as specified in TS 25.141, TS 25.142, and TS 25.143. It should explain the requirements for multi-band operation and the necessity to test each type of port for BS with multiple ports. The test configurations for demonstrating conformance, including the use of a single UTRA carrier for single-carrier capable BS and the configurations listed in TS 25.141, should be covered. Additionally, the answer should detail the configurations for immunity tests, including the connection to ancillary equipment, selection of ports, recording of test conditions, establishment of communication links, and BLER evaluation. The importance of activating all operating bands during immunity tests should also be highlighted."
"Describe the procedures and actions taken by the MSC Server when handling RETRIEVE, RetrieveMPTY, and BuildMPTY requests from a UE, including the conditions and responses involved.","When handling RETRIEVE requests from a UE, the MSC Server follows specific procedures based on the media state on the IM CN subsystem side of the CS-MGW. If the media is 'recvonly' or 'sendrecv', no interworking is required, and the MSC Server sends a RETRIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE. If the media is 'sendonly' or 'inactive', the MSC Server sends an UPDATE or re-INVITE request with an SDP offer marked as 'recvonly' or 'sendrecv'. The MSC Server may include RR and RS bandwidth modifiers set to zero to disable RTCP. Upon receiving a 200 OK response with the SDP answer, the MSC Server sends a RETRIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE. If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received, the MSC Server sends a RETRIEVE REJECT message with the cause parameter set to 'Facility rejected'.

For RetrieveMPTY requests, when the MSC Server receives such a request from a UE with a conference on hold, it sends an UPDATE or re-INVITE request containing a new SDP offer. Upon receiving a 200 OK response with the SDP answer, the MSC Server sends a FACILITY message indicating success. If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received, the MSC Server sends a FACILITY message with a return error parameter set to 'SystemFailure'.

When handling BuildMPTY requests, if the MSC Server receives such a request from a UE with a conference on hold and a separate active or waiting call, it invites the remote party to the conference and sends an UPDATE or re-INVITE request to resume the held conference. These actions are performed in accordance with related specifications.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- For RETRIEVE messages: The conditions based on media states ('recvonly', 'sendrecv', 'sendonly', 'inactive'), the actions taken by the MSC Server (sending RETRIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE, UPDATE or re-INVITE requests), handling SDP answers, and sending RETRIEVE REJECT messages with cause parameters.
- For RetrieveMPTY requests: The process of sending UPDATE or re-INVITE requests, handling SDP answers, and sending FACILITY messages indicating success or system failure.
- For BuildMPTY requests: The steps of inviting remote parties to the conference, sending UPDATE or re-INVITE requests to resume held conferences, and referencing related specifications (3GPP TS 24.084 and 3GPP TS 24.292)."
Describe the interleaving and mapping process for SACCH and SID_UPDATE frames as specified in TS 45.003.,"The interleaving process for the Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH) is done as specified in subclause 4.1.5 of TS 45.003, with the exception that the bits hl(B) and hu(B) are set to '0'. The mapping rule for SACCH is given by the equation: e(B,j) = i(B,j) and e(B,59+j) = i(B,57+j) for j = 0,1,...,56, with e(B,57) = hl(B) and e(B,58) = hu(B). For SACCH, the bits hl(B) and hu(B) are set to '1' to indicate control channel signalling.

"What are the requirements for supporting 3D/VR audio in various 3GPP services, and how do they relate to the MPEG-H Audio System and OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver?","The requirements for supporting 3D/VR audio in various 3GPP services are closely tied to the capabilities of the multi-stream-enabled MPEG-H Audio System and the compliance with the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver.

The multi-stream-enabled MPEG-H Audio System is designed to handle Audio Programme Components delivered in multiple elementary streams. For example, the main MHAS stream may contain one complete audio main, while one or more auxiliary MHAS streams may contain different languages and audio descriptions. The MPEG-H Audio Metadata (MAE) ensures that the MPEG-H Audio Decoder can correctly decode these multiple MHAS streams. When delivering the MPEG-H Audio Scene in multiple streams, the sample entry 'mhm2' is used, and all constraints for file formats using this sample entry specified in ISO/IEC 23090-2 clause 10.2.2.3.3 must be adhered to.

For 3GPP services, specific requirements are outlined for different clients supporting 3D/VR audio:

1. **3GPP PSS Client**: If the client supports 3D/VR audio for DASH services, it should include a receiver that complies with the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver requirements for file format signalling and encapsulation as specified in TS 26.118 clause 6.2.2.3.

2. **MBMS Client**: If the client supports 3D/VR audio for DASH-over-MBMS services, it should include a receiver that complies with the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver requirements for DASH as specified in TS 26.118 clause 6.2.2.3.

3. **5GMS UE**: If the UE supports 3D/VR audio for DASH services, it should include a receiver that complies with the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver requirements for file format signalling and encapsulation as specified in TS 26.118 clause 6.2.2.3.

In summary, the support for 3D/VR audio in these 3GPP services requires compliance with the OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver, ensuring proper file format signalling and encapsulation as detailed in TS 26.118 clause 6.2.2.3, and leveraging the capabilities of the multi-stream-enabled MPEG-H Audio System.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of the multi-stream-enabled MPEG-H Audio System and its capabilities, including handling multiple elementary streams and the role of MPEG-H Audio Metadata (MAE).
  - Description of the 'mhm2' sample entry and its constraints as per ISO/IEC standards.
  - Specific requirements for 3GPP PSS client, MBMS client, and 5GMS UE in supporting 3D/VR audio, highlighting the need for compliance with OMAF 3D Audio Baseline Media Profile Receiver as specified in TS 26.118 clause 6.2.2.3."
"Describe the process and requirements for managing user consent when accessing the Eees_UELocation API, including the roles of EES and EAS, and the procedures for updating location information subscriptions.","Managing user consent when accessing the Eees_UELocation API involves several steps and requirements based on local regulations and operator policies. User consent management specified in Annex V may be required, and the EES acts as the consent enforcement entity when accessing 5GC network services directly. If user consent is revoked, the EES must stop processing data related to the concerned UE(s), send a revocation notification to the EAS, and update the subscription resources accordingly. The EAS must also take necessary actions to stop processing data and delete the corresponding subscription resource if consent is revoked for all UE(s).

Updating location information subscriptions involves sending HTTP PATCH or PUT messages to the EES. The PATCH message updates specific parameters, while the PUT message replaces all properties except easId, ueId, and groupId. The EES checks authorization, updates the subscription resource, and returns the updated information. Proper error handling and redirection may be required if the request fails or needs to be redirected. The EAS must send an update subscription request before the expiry time to maintain the subscription.

The roles of EES and NEF as consent enforcing entities depend on their interaction with 5GC services. If the EES utilizes 5GC services without NEF, it acts as the consent enforcing entity. If it uses 5GC services via NEF, the NEF acts as the consent enforcing entity. The user consent architecture is applicable only when EES or NEF and the data provider are operated by the same entity.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The necessity of user consent management and enforcement for accessing the Eees_UELocation API as per local regulations and operator policies.
  - The specific actions required by EES and EAS when user consent is revoked, including stopping data processing, sending notifications, and updating subscription resources.
  - The process for updating location information subscriptions using HTTP PATCH and PUT messages, including authorization checks, error handling, and managing subscription expiry.
  - The roles of EES and NEF as consent enforcing entities depending on their interaction with 5GC services, and the applicability of user consent architecture."
Describe the loopback delay requirements and UE test loop modes as specified in 3GPP TS 34.109.,"The loopback delay is defined as the delay between received downlink (DL) radio frames and their corresponding uplink (UL) radio frames produced from the received data. This delay is measured at the antenna connector of the User Equipment (UE) and is specified in units of radio frames. Timing offset between DL and UL radio frames, and timing errors are not included in the loopback delay.

For UE operating in test loop mode 1, the loopback delay requirement applies to a radio bearer with a closed test loop if the MAC and RLC protocols for that radio bearer are configured for transparent operation and if the downlink RLC SDU size is equal to the downlink transport block size, meaning no segmentation or concatenation occurs. However, this requirement is not applicable for unacknowledged mode radio bearers configured on HS-DSCH and E-DPDCH.

In test loop mode 2, the loopback delay requirement is applicable for any radio bearer configuration. In test loop mode 3, the received data is only counted and not looped back to the SS, so the loopback delay requirement does not apply.

The UE must maintain a fixed loopback delay during a test if the configuration of radio bearers with closed test loops remains unchanged. The loopback delay must not exceed the number of radio frames corresponding to 10 times the TTI of the actual transport channel configuration.

Additionally, the maximum delay from receiving an RLC or PDCP SDU in a downlink SAP until returning an SDU in the corresponding uplink SAP must be within the delay requirement specified in subclause 5.3.2.9.1. The UE test loop function, operating in test loop mode 1, must be able to return at least 4 SDUs within the time equal to the TTI of the actual radio bearer. This requirement ensures that the UE can loop back 4 SDUs per TTI, which is necessary for testing certain Conversational CS TM reference radio bearer combinations.

Regarding message types and UE positioning technology values, the message is sent from the SS to the UE, and the UE positioning technology is represented as a single octet Information Element (IE). The values are defined as follows: '00000000' for AGPS and '00000001' for AGNSS, with all other values reserved for future use.","The answer must include the definition of loopback delay, how it is measured, and the specific requirements for different UE test loop modes (1, 2, and 3). It should also cover the maximum delay for returning SDUs, the ability to return SDUs within the TTI, and the requirement for looping back 4 SDUs per TTI. Additionally, it should mention the message type and UE positioning technology values as specified in TS 34.109."

"Describe the timing relationships between various physical channels in the 3GPP TS 25.211 specification, including the P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH, PICH, AICH, DPCH, F-DPCH, HS-SCCH, HS-PDSCH, E-HICH, E-DPCCH, and E-DPDCH.","The 3GPP TS 25.211 specification outlines the timing relationships between various physical channels as follows:

1. **P-CCPCH**: The Primary Common Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH) serves as the timing reference for all physical channels, directly for downlink and indirectly for uplink.

2. **SCH, CPICH, and P-CCPCH**: The Synchronization Channel (SCH), Common Pilot Channel (CPICH), and P-CCPCH have identical frame timings.

3. **S-CCPCH**: The Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (S-CCPCH) timing may differ for different S-CCPCHs, but the offset from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips. For S-CCPCH carrying BCH, the offset is zero.

4. **PICH**: If the Paging Indicator Channel (PICH) is associated with the S-CCPCH, its timing is 7680 chips prior to the corresponding S-CCPCH frame timing. If associated with the HS-SCCH, the PICH frame timing is the same as the HS-SCCH frame timing.

5. **AICH**: The Acquisition Indicator Channel (AICH) access slot #0 starts at the same time as P-CCPCH frames with (SFN modulo 2) = 0.

6. **DPCH and F-DPCH**: The Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) and Fractional DPCH (F-DPCH) timing may differ for different channels, but the offset from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips.

7. **HS-SCCH**: The start of High-Speed Shared Control Channel (HS-SCCH) subframe #0 is aligned with the start of the P-CCPCH frames. The relative timing between a High-Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) and the corresponding HS-SCCH is 5120 chips after the start of the HS-SCCH.

8. **E-HICH, E-RGCH, E-AGCH, E-ROCH**: The Enhanced Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (E-HICH), Enhanced Relative Grant Channel (E-RGCH), Enhanced Absolute Grant Channel (E-AGCH), and Enhanced Resource Overhead Channel (E-ROCH) downlink timing are specified relative to the P-CCPCH.

9. **E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH**: The frame timing of all Enhanced Dedicated Physical Control Channels (E-DPCCHs) and Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channels (E-DPDCHs) transmitted from one UE shall be the same as the uplink DPCCH frame timing.

10. **PICH and S-CCPCH**: The timing relation between a PICH frame and its associated single S-CCPCH frame is such that a paging indicator set in a PICH frame means the paging message is transmitted on the PCH in the S-CCPCH frame starting 7680 chips after the transmitted PICH frame.

11. **E-HICH Timing**: The E-HICH frame offset relative to P-CCPCH varies depending on the E-DCH Transmission Time Interval (TTI).

12. **HS-SCCH and HS-PDSCH**: The HS-PDSCH starts 5120 chips after the start of the HS-SCCH.

13. **Uplink DPCH, HS-PDSCH, and HS-DPCCH**: The timing offset between the uplink DPCH, HS-PDSCH, and HS-DPCCH at the UE is calculated based on the difference in chips between the transmit timing of the start of the related HS-PDSCH subframe and the start of the downlink DPCH or F-DPCH frame from the HS-DSCH serving cell.

"Describe the requirements for UE cell identification and measurement delay for TDD intra-frequency cells, including conditions for different UE categories and measurement reporting delays.","The requirements for UE cell identification and measurement delay for TDD intra-frequency cells are specified with applicability to Category M1, M2, and non-BL/CE UEs. When no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is in use, the UE must be able to identify and measure a new detectable TDD intra-frequency cell according to the requirements in Table 8.2.14.3-1 if the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SCH Ês/Iot) is greater than or equal to -6 dB, provided one of the following conditions is met: G=1, rmax*G < 80ms, or the UE is receiving Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). Otherwise, the requirements in Table 8.2.14.3-3 apply, where rmax and G are defined by higher layer parameters mPDCCH-NumRepetition and mPDCCH-startSF-UESS respectively.

Table 8.2.14.3-1 outlines the requirement on cell identification delay and measurement delay for TDD intra-frequency cells, with Kintra_M1_NC defined as 100/X, where X is signaled by the RRC parameter measGapSharingScheme and varies based on the configuration of highSpeedMeasGapCE-ModeA. If inter-frequency measurement is not configured, Kintra_M1_NC equals 1 regardless of the measGapSharingScheme configuration.

Table 8.2.14.3-3 specifies the requirement on cell identification delay and measurement delay for TDD intra-frequency cells with MPDCCH scaling, where KRSTD_M1_NC is applicable if certain conditions are met, such as the cell-specific positioning subframe configuration period being greater than 40 ms and the PRS bandwidth being less than the bandwidth of the cell used for RSTD measurement.

A cell is considered detectable when the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) related conditions specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 9.1.21.1, 9.1.21.2, and 9.1.21.6 are fulfilled for the corresponding band, along with SCH_RP and SCH Ês/Iot conditions as per 3GPP TS 36.133 Annex Table B.2.14-1.

In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurement period for intra-frequency measurements follows Table 8.13.2.1.3.1-1. When measurement gaps are activated, the UE must be capable of performing measurements for at least six cells. If more than six cells are identified, the UE continues measurements but may decrease the reporting rate of RSRP and RSRQ measurements to higher layers.

The accuracy of RSRP measurements for all measured cells must meet the specifications in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 9.1.21.1 and 9.1.21.2. Event-triggered measurement reports must comply with the requirements in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 9.1.21.1, 9.1.21.2, and 9.1.21.6.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling on the DCCH and the delay uncertainty from inserting the report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The event-triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without Layer 3 filtering, must be less than Tidentify_intra_UE cat M1_NC as defined in clause 8.13.2.1.2.2. Additional delays can be expected if Layer 3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial is configured.

If a cell becomes undetectable for a period of ≤ 5 seconds and then detectable again, triggering an event, the event-triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than Tmeasure_intra_UE cat M1_NC, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than 50 Ts and Layer 3 filtering has not been used. Additional delays can be expected if Layer 3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial is configured.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the applicability to different UE categories (M1, M2, non-BL/CE)
  - Conditions under which the UE can identify and measure a new detectable TDD intra-frequency cell

Describe the key elements and procedures involved in the GSM EFR codec as specified in the 3GPP TS 46.060 document.,"The GSM Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) codec involves several key elements and procedures as specified in the 3GPP TS 46.060 document. 

Firstly, the audio parts include analogue-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analogue (D/A) conversion functions. The A/D conversion involves elements such as a microphone, input level adjustment device, input anti-aliasing filter, sample-hold device sampling at 8 kHz, and conversion to a 13-bit uniform digital PCM format represented in two's complement. The D/A conversion involves converting 13-bit/8 kHz uniform PCM to analogue, a hold device, reconstruction filter including x/sin(x) correction, output level adjustment device, and an earphone or loudspeaker.

The conversion process between 13-bit uniform and 8-bit A-law or μ-law samples is defined by ITU-T Recommendations G.711 and G.714. The encoder receives data with 13-bit resolution left justified in a 16-bit word, with the three least significant bits set to '0'. The decoder outputs data in the same format, and further processing is required if the traffic data occurs in a different representation.

The GSM EFR encoding process is described functionally, and the decoding procedures are outlined separately. The encoder produces output information in a unique sequence and format, which the decoder must receive in the same way. The sequence of output bits and the bit allocation for each parameter are shown in a specific table. The encoded speech parameters have unequal importance with respect to subjective quality, and the bits must be rearranged in the sequence of importance before being submitted to the channel encoding function.

Additionally, the conversion between 8-bit A-law or μ-law compressed data and linear data with 13-bit resolution at the speech encoder input is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.711. Examples of performing the conversion using fixed-point arithmetic can be found in ITU-T Recommendation G.726.

Overall, the GSM EFR codec involves detailed procedures for A/D and D/A conversion, specific data formats for encoding and decoding, and the importance of rearranging encoded bits based on their subjective quality.","The answer should cover the functional description of the audio parts including A/D and D/A functions, the conversion process between 13-bit uniform and 8-bit A-law or μ-law samples, the encoding and decoding procedures of GSM EFR, the sequence and importance of encoded parameters, and the specific ITU-T recommendations for conversion processes. It should also mention the elements involved in analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversion, the data format used by the encoder and decoder, and the rearrangement of bits based on their importance."
"Describe the inter-RAT handover procedures and key considerations for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, including fallback mechanisms and paging optimizations.","Inter-RAT handover procedures for E-UTRA connected to 5GC involve several key considerations and mechanisms to ensure seamless mobility and service continuity. 

Firstly, intra-EUTRA inter-system handover, which refers to handover between E-UTRA connected to 5GC and E-UTRA connected to EPC, is described in clause 10.2.2c of TS 36.300 and TS 23.502. However, DAPS Handover and Conditional Handover are not supported for E-UTRA connected to 5GC. The inter-RAT intra-5GC handover, which involves handover between E-UTRA connected to 5GC and NR connected to 5GC, is detailed in clause 9.3.1.2 of TS 38.300. Unsupported handover types include inter-RAT handover to/from GERAN/UTRAN/CDMA2000 and cell change order to GERAN with NACC, while CS fallback is not applied except for release with redirection to GERAN/UTRAN.

Supported mobility procedures include RRC Connection Release with Redirection to GERAN/UTRAN/CDMA2000/EUTRAN and Cell Change Order to GERAN without NACC. When the UE is connected to E-UTRA/5GC, fallback towards E-UTRAN is performed if 5GC does not support certain services, as specified in TS 23.501. Depending on factors like CN interface availability, network configuration, and radio conditions, the fallback procedure can result in either RRC CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or RRC IDLE state mobility (redirection).

Paging optimizations for E-UTRA connected to 5GC are also crucial. In RRC_IDLE, the UE monitors the PCCH for CN-initiated paging information, while in RRC_INACTIVE, except for NB-IoT, the UE monitors the PCCH for both RAN-initiated and CN-initiated paging information. The same paging mechanism is used for both, and extended DRX cycles up to 10.24 seconds without PTW are supported for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage in RRC_INACTIVE.

CS fallback options are summarized in TS 36.300, clause 10.2.5, which includes necessary UE capabilities and FGI index settings that should be set to '1'.

The principles of inter-RAT handover design include network-controlled handover through the source access system, backwards handover where radio resources are prepared in the target system before the UE is commanded to change, and the use of a control interface at CN level. The target access system provides exact guidance for the UE on how to make the radio access, and mechanisms to avoid data loss, such as forwarding, can be used until the 3GPP Anchor determines it can send DL U-plane data directly to the target system. The handover procedure should not require any UE to CN signaling for data to start flowing in the target system, and similar procedures apply for both real-time and non-real-time services, as well as for inter-RAT handover, intra-LTE handover with EPC node change, and intra-E-UTRA inter-system handover. Blind handover is supported, and specific inter-RAT handover configurations are detailed, including supported and unsupported scenarios.

Finally, the source RAT configures target RAT measurement and reporting, initiates handover preparation, and provides necessary information to the target RAT in a transparent RRC container. Radio resources are prepared in the target RAT before the handover, and the RRC reconfiguration message from the target RAT is delivered to the source RAT via a transparent container and passed to the UE in the handover command. In-sequence and lossless handover is supported, and both Xn and NG based inter-RAT handover between NG-RAN nodes are supported, with delta-configuration for radio bearer configuration used to maintain SDAP and PDCP configurations.","The answer must include details on the intra-EUTRA inter-system handover and inter-RAT intra-5GC handover procedures, highlighting unsupported handover types and supported mobility procedures. It should explain fallback mechanisms when 5GC does not support certain services, and describe paging optimizations and extended DRX cycles. Additionally, it should cover CS fallback options, necessary UE capabilities, and FGI index settings. The principles of inter-RAT handover design, including network-controlled handover, backwards handover, control interface at CN level, guidance for UE, mechanisms to avoid data loss, and handover procedure requirements should be detailed. Finally, the source RAT configuration for target RAT measurement and reporting, handover preparation initiation, transparent RRC container, radio resource preparation, RRC reconfiguration message, inter-RAT handover command message, in-sequence and lossless handover, Xn and NG based inter-RAT handover, and delta-configuration for radio bearer configuration should be included."
"Explain the process and considerations for PCC rule authorization in 5G networks, including the role of the PCF and the handling of emergency services and User Plane Remote Provisioning.","PCC rule authorization in 5G networks involves several key processes and considerations, primarily managed by the Policy Control Function (PCF). The PCF is responsible for selecting the appropriate 5G QoS parameters for PCC rules, taking into account various factors such as 5GC specific restrictions, subscription information, and other available data. 

For dynamic PCC rules associated with Application Function (AF) sessions, the PCF performs authorization as described in the relevant clauses. Additionally, PCC rules without corresponding AF sessions are also authorized by the PCF. Each PCC rule is assigned a set of QoS parameters supported by the specific Access Network.

Special handling is required for emergency services, where PCC rule authorization must be supported without subscription information. In such cases, the PCF applies local policies configured for emergency services. Similarly, for User Plane Remote Provisioning of UE SNPN Credentials, the authorization process varies depending on whether it is for Onboarding SNPN or other scenarios. For Onboarding SNPN, the process is supported without subscription information, while other cases require subscription information.

User Plane Remote Provisioning of UE SNPN Credentials involves the use of Data Network Name (DNN) and Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI) for onboarding. The PCF may impose restrictions on the PDU Session, such as limiting traffic to specific Provisioning Server and DNS server addresses. When the Onboarding Indication is provided by the Session Management Function (SMF), the PCF uses locally stored Onboarding Configuration Data to make authorization and policy decisions. If the Onboarding Indication is not provided, the PCF retrieves the policy control subscription profile from the User Data Repository (UDR).

The session binding process is another critical aspect, where the PCF associates AF session information with a specific PDU Session. This involves considering parameters such as UE IP address, MAC address, UE identity, and DNN. The PCF identifies the impacted PDU Session and determines the affected PCC rules, including new rules to be installed and existing rules to be modified or removed.

Overall, the PCC rule authorization process in 5G networks is comprehensive, ensuring that QoS parameters are appropriately selected and applied, while also addressing special scenarios like emergency services and User Plane Remote Provisioning.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the PCF in PCC rule authorization and the selection of QoS parameters.
  - Considerations for PCC rule authorization, including 5GC specific restrictions, subscription information, and local policies.
  - Special handling for emergency services and User Plane Remote Provisioning, including scenarios with and without subscription information.
  - The process of User Plane Remote Provisioning of UE SNPN Credentials, including the use of DNN and S-NSSAI, and the handling of Onboarding Indication.
  - The session binding process and its impact on PCC rules, including the association of AF session information to PDU Sessions."
Describe the mechanisms and requirements for terminating MBMS user services and establishing streaming sessions as defined in the relevant 3GPP technical specifications.,"The mechanisms for terminating MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) user services and establishing streaming sessions are defined in various 3GPP technical specifications. 

For terminating MBMS user services, the following mechanisms are used:
1. **Unicast Bearer Service Termination**: This involves terminating the reception of MBMS user service data via a UMTS/EPS Bearer Service with interactive and/or streaming traffic class. For MBMS Streaming delivery methods or combined MBMS Streaming and MBMS Download delivery methods, the Packet Switched Streaming Service (PSS) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 is used. The termination of a PSS session is described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 26.234. For MBMS Download delivery methods, the MBMS UE (User Equipment) is deregistered in the BM-SC (Broadcast Multicast Service Center) to terminate the OMA-PUSH based reception of files.

For establishing streaming sessions, the following requirements are specified:
1. **PSS Server Functionality**: Content providers must support PSS server functionality according to PSS as described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 26.234. The streaming session must be accessible prior to the start of the session.
2. **SDP File Usage**: A URL to the SDP (Session Description Protocol) file that describes the streaming session between the Content Provider and the BM-SC is provided via the sdp-url. The SDP must include RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) links for every media session as part of the “a=control” attribute to enable RTSP control of the session. The SDP must also contain the required bitrate for each media session.
3. **User Plane Protection**: When user plane data is provided via UDP, SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) over DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) must be used for user plane protection. Establishment of TCP-based user plane sessions with PSS is not supported.
4. **Error Handling**: If there is any error retrieving the SDP, the session must not be started.

These mechanisms and requirements ensure the proper termination of MBMS user services and the secure and efficient establishment of streaming sessions.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The mechanisms for terminating MBMS user services, including the use of PSS for streaming and deregistration in BM-SC for download delivery.
- The requirements for content providers to support PSS server functionality, including session accessibility prior to start, usage of SDP files, RTSP control, and user plane protection using SRTP over DTLS.
- The prohibition of TCP-based user plane sessions with PSS.
- The importance of error handling in retrieving SDP files to ensure session initiation."
"Describe the methods and formats specified for manipulating resources using HTTP PATCH, including the atomic nature of the PATCH method and the extensions for handling multiple resources.","The methods and formats specified for manipulating resources using HTTP PATCH are designed to efficiently handle both single and multiple resource updates. 

Firstly, the HTTP GET method allows for retrieving multiple resources with a single request, as discussed in clause 6.1. This method is useful for gathering information without making any modifications.

For manipulating resources, the HTTP PATCH method is used, as detailed in clause 6.3.1. HTTP PATCH allows for partial updates of a single resource by describing a set of changes in the request message body, known as a patch document. The atomic nature of the PATCH method ensures that the entire set of changes is applied atomically; if any part of the patch document cannot be successfully applied, none of the changes are made. This guarantees transaction semantics, meaning the resource is either fully updated or not updated at all.

Two patch formats for JSON are defined for use with the HTTP PATCH method: JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) and JSON Patch (RFC 6902). JSON Merge Patch is simpler and suitable for basic modifications, while JSON Patch is more powerful and allows for complex operations.

Clause 6.4.1 introduces extensions to these formats, called 3GPP JSON Merge Patch and 3GPP JSON Patch, which are designed to efficiently manipulate multiple resources with a single HTTP PATCH request. These extensions enable the target resource and all its descendant resources to be accessed and modified in one request, enhancing efficiency and reducing the number of required operations.

In summary, the specified methods and formats provide robust and efficient ways to retrieve and manipulate resources, ensuring atomic updates and supporting complex modifications across multiple resources.","The answer should include:
  - Explanation of the HTTP GET method for retrieving multiple resources.
  - Description of the HTTP PATCH method for manipulating multiple resources.
  - Details on the atomic nature of the HTTP PATCH method.
  - Information on JSON Merge Patch and JSON Patch formats.
  - Extensions to these formats for handling multiple resources efficiently."
"Describe the procedures and commands involved in requesting, continuously reporting, and canceling network status reports in the 3GPP TS 29.153 specification.","The 3GPP TS 29.153 specification outlines several procedures and commands for managing network status reports. 

1. **Requesting Network Status Reports**:
   - The SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function) uses the Network-Status-Request (NSR) command to request either one-time or continuous network status reports from the RCAF (Radio Congestion Awareness Function). This procedure involves assigning a SCEF Reference ID and identifying the responsible RCAF(s) based on the geographical area provided by the SCS/AS (Service Capability Server/Application Server) or pre-configured RCAF addresses.
   - The NSR command includes several AVPs (Attribute-Value Pairs) such as Ns-Request-Type (with value 0 for initial request), SCEF-Reference-ID, Network-Area-Info-List (location area information), Monitoring-Duration (for continuous reporting), and Congestion-Level-Range (threshold values for reporting).

2. **Discovering RCAF(s)**:
   - The SCEF discovers the RCAF(s) responsible for reporting network status using the geographical area information provided by the SCS/AS or pre-configured RCAF addresses for the specific geographical area.

3. **Continuous Reporting of Network Status**:
   - The RCAF continuously notifies the SCEF of congestion status changes using the Network-Status-Continuous-Report-Request (NCR) command. This procedure is triggered when congestion levels change, either with or without specified thresholds.
   - The NCR command includes AVPs such as SCEF-Reference-ID, Network-Congestion-Area-Report (congestion status), Congestion-Level-Value, Network-Area-Info-List (affected location area), and Destination-Host (SCEF ID).
   - The SCEF acknowledges the NCR command with the Network-Status-Continuous-Report-Answer (NCA) command.

4. **Canceling Continuous Network Status Reports**:
   - The SCEF requests the cancellation of ongoing continuous network status reports using the NSR command with Ns-Request-Type set to 1 (cancellation request). This is done when the reporting duration is over or upon request from the SCS/AS.
   - The NSR command for cancellation includes the SCEF-Reference-ID AVP. Upon receiving this command, the RCAF removes the related instructions and acknowledges the cancellation with the NSA command.

5. **Call Flows**:
   - Annex A of the specification provides informative call flows over Ns, which help in understanding the detailed interactions and procedures involved in requesting, continuously reporting, and canceling network status reports.

These procedures ensure efficient monitoring and reporting of network congestion status, facilitating better network management and service quality.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The procedure for requesting network status reports, including the initial request and the AVPs involved.
- How the SCEF discovers the RCAF(s) responsible for reporting network status.
- The continuous reporting procedure by the RCAF, including conditions for reporting and the AVPs involved.
- The procedure for canceling continuous network status reports, including the AVPs involved.
- Reference to the call flows over Ns for a comprehensive understanding of the procedures."
Describe the procedure for MT SMS over NAS via IP-SM-GW as defined in 3GPP TS 23.540.,"The procedure for Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS over NAS via IP-SM-GW as defined in 3GPP TS 23.540 involves several steps:

1. The interaction between the Service Center (SC) and the SMS-Gateway Mobile Switching Center (SMS-GMSC) follows the current procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040.
2. The SMS-GMSC queries the Network Resource Function (NRF) to find the User Data Management (UDM) instance(s) that support SMS Service-Based Interfaces (SBI) and manage the user subscriptions of the GPSI. The SMS-GMSC may need to retrieve the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID of the recipient's GPSI before discovering the UDM instance based on the GPSI-to-Subscription-Network resolution procedure.
3. The SMS-GMSC invokes Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM (GPSI) to the UDM to get the serving node information for all access types for the User Equipment (UE).
4. The UDM checks the registration/reachability flags to determine the potential target nodes, such as the SMS Function (SMSF). For MT SMS transfer via IP-SM-GW, the UDM invokes the Nipsmgw_SMService_RoutingInfo to provide the SMSF Instance ID to the IP-SM-GW. The address of the IP-SM-GW to be contacted by the UDM may be configured locally.
5. The IP-SM-GW sends the Nipsmgw_SMService_RoutingInfo response to the UDM.
6. The UDM responds to the SMS-GMSC by sending Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM response, including the IP-SM-GW address, the indication for SMSF SMS_SBI support, and the indication for IP-SM-GW SMS_SBI support.
7-8. The SMS-GMSC forwards the SMS message to the IP-SM-GW, which then performs service authorization and domain selection to determine the domain for delivery of the Short Message as defined in 3GPP TS 23.204. If the SMSF is selected, the IP-SM-GW forwards the SMS message to the SMSF. If the IP-SM-GW has more than one SMSF address to use for SMS transport towards the UE, it chooses which SMSF address to use first based on operator local policy.
   - If both SMSF and IP-SM-GW indicate support for SMS_SBI, the SMS-GMSC forwards the SMS message to the IP-SM-GW by invoking Nipsmgw_SMService_MtForwardSm service operation, and then the IP-SM-GW forwards the SMS message to the SMSF by invoking Nsmsf_SMService_MtForwardSm service operation.
   - If either SMSF or IP-SM-GW indicates that it does not support SMS_SBI, the SMS-GMSC forwards the SMS message to IP-SM-GW by legacy MAP/Diameter protocol, and then IP-SM-GW forwards the SMS message to the SMSF by legacy MAP/Diameter protocol. The following steps follow the procedures for legacy MT SMS message transfer.
9. The MT SMS over NAS procedure between SMSF, Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), and UE is the same as in step 4a to 6b of Figure 4.13.3.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502.
10. The SMSF delivers the delivery report to the IP-SM-GW by sending the Nsmsf_SMService_MtForwardSm response to the IP-SM-GW.
11. The IP-SM-GW delivers the delivery report to the SMS-GMSC by sending the Nipsmgw_SMService_MtForwardSm response to the SMS-GMSC.
12. The IP-SM-GW may report the Short Message (SM) Delivery Status to the UDM by invoking Nudm_ReportSMDeliveryStatus_Request.
13. The UDM responds with Nudm_ReportSMDeliveryStatus_Request response to the IP-SM-GW.
14-15. The SMS-GMSC may report the SM-Delivery Status to the UDM by invoking Nudm_ReportSMDeliveryStatus_Request, and the UDM shall ignore the information provided in this report.
16. The SMS-GMSC delivers the delivery report to the SC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040.
17. The MT SMS over NAS procedure between SMSF, AMF, and UE is the same as in step 6c to 6d of Figure 4.13.3.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502.","The answer must include the detailed steps of the MT SMS interaction between SC and SMS-GMSC, the querying process of the NRF for UDM instance, the invocation of Nudm_UECM_SendRoutingInfoForSM, the determination of potential target nodes by UDM, the response process of Nipsmgw_SMService_RoutingInfo, the forwarding of SMS message to IP-SM-GW, the service authorization and domain selection process, the protocol selection based on SMS_SBI support, the MT SMS over NAS procedure between SMSF, AMF, and UE, the delivery report process, and the reporting of SM-Delivery Status."
What is the significance of the CancelPriority parameter in MCPTT private calls?,"The CancelPriority parameter is used to control the authorization of an MCPTT (Mission Critical Push-To-Talk) user to cancel an emergency priority in a private call. When the parameter is set to 'true', the MCPTT user is authorized to cancel the emergency priority, allowing them to downgrade the priority of the call if necessary. Conversely, when the parameter is set to 'false', the user is not authorized to cancel the emergency priority, meaning the call will retain its high priority status. This parameter is crucial for managing the prioritization of calls in mission-critical communication scenarios.","The answer should explain that the CancelPriority parameter is used to control the authorization of an MCPTT user to cancel an emergency priority in a private call. When set to 'true', the user is authorized to cancel the emergency priority, and when set to 'false', the user is not authorized to do so."
"Describe the key features and message types of GTP' as defined in TS 32.295, including the differences between versions and the reused GTP message types.","GTP' (GPRS Tunneling Protocol prime) is a protocol defined in TS 32.295 that includes a set of messages exchanged between two associated nodes. The key features of GTP' include its relationship with the original GTP protocol, where certain message types are reused, and the introduction of new message types specific to GTP'.

The reused GTP message types, such as Echo Request and Echo Response, are utilized in PS domain charging to check the status of nodes (CDF or CGF). If there is a discrepancy between the descriptions in TS 32.295 and TS 29.060, the latter should be considered the latest specification. Additionally, if the path protocol is TCP, Echo Request and Echo Response messages are not required.

The Version Not Supported message in GTP' indicates the latest version supported by the receiving node. If a node receives a message of an unsupported version, it returns a Version Not Supported message and discards the payload data. The version bits in the GTP' header can have values indicating different versions:
- GTP' version 0 (binary '000') includes message types like Version Not Supported, Node Alive Request, Node Alive Response, Redirection Request, and Redirection Response.
- GTP' version 1 (binary '001') is similar to version 0 but includes a duplicate CDR prevention mechanism.
- GTP' version 2 (binary '010') has a shorter header (6 octets) and supports IPv6 address types.

GTP' introduces new message types categorized into Path Management messages (Node Alive Request, Node Alive Response, Redirection Request, Redirection Response) and Record Transmission messages (Data Record Transfer Request, Data Record Transfer Response). Reserved fields in these messages are filled with ones for future use.

The protocol reuses GTP Cause values and allocates specific number ranges for Information Elements and Cause Codes. For example, TV type fields are allocated numbers 117-127, and TLV type fields are allocated numbers 239-254. Charging-related Cause values are also defined, such as 'System failure' and 'Request not fulfilled'.

For further details on reused GTP messages, TS 29.060 should be referenced.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Overview of GTP' features and its relationship with GTP as per TS 32.295.
  - Explanation of reused GTP message types, specifically Echo Request and Echo Response, and their usage in PS domain charging.

  - Reference to TS 29.060 for further details on reused GTP messages."
How does the mobile station handle system information and paging messages during an MBMS session according to 3GPP TS 43.246?,"During an MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) session, the mobile station is required to read system information for the serving cell and be capable of receiving Circuit Switched (CS) and/or Packet Switched (PS) paging messages. The acquisition of system information and paging messages is typically done on the (P)BCCH (Packet Broadcast Control Channel) and (P)CCCH (Packet Common Control Channel) or on the PACCH (Packet Associated Control Channel), as indicated by the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator Information Element (IE) included in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT and MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION messages.

The mobile station reads paging messages from the (P)CCCH in parallel with the reception of the MBMS radio bearer unless the network has indicated, by setting the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, that paging messages are sent on the PACCH of the MBMS radio bearer. If the mobile station has not yet received an MS_ID (Mobile Station Identifier) on the MBMS radio bearer and the location of the MBMS radio bearer with respect to the control channels does not allow the mobile station to read the (P)CCCH, the mobile station must skip the reception of those radio blocks of the MBMS radio bearer that would prevent the monitoring of its paging group on the paging channels.

Additionally, if the mobile station is in a non-DRX (Discontinuous Reception) mode period, such as during a routing area update procedure, it must read all the paging occurrences on the (P)CCCH. The network does not need to send paging messages on the PACCH to a mobile station whose MS_ID has been released because the mobile station did not respond when polled (i.e., T3195 timer has started for that MS_ID). If the network sets the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, MBMS notifications are also sent on the PACCH.

For system information, the mobile station reads it from the (P)BCCH in parallel with the reception of the MBMS radio bearer unless the network has indicated, by setting the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, that system information is sent on the PACCH of the MBMS radio bearer.","The answer should include details on how the mobile station reads system information and paging messages during an MBMS session. It should cover the acquisition of system information and paging messages on (P)BCCH and (P)CCCH or PACCH, the role of the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, handling of MS_ID, and conditions under which the mobile station skips MBMS radio blocks to monitor paging channels."
Describe the performance measurements related to MO SMS delivery procedures in the 5GS network as specified in TS 28.552.,"The performance measurements related to MO SMS delivery procedures in the 5GS network, as specified in TS 28.552, include two key metrics:

1. **Number of MO SMS Delivery Procedure Requests Received by the SMSF from AMF**:
   - This measurement tracks the number of Mobile Originated (MO) SMS delivery procedure requests received by the Short Message Service Function (SMSF) from the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).
   - The requests are sent via the resource URL '/ue-contexts/{supi}/sendsms' as specified in clause 5.2.2.4 of TS 29.540.
   - Each request is added to a relevant subcounter per Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI).
   - The subcounter is represented as an integer value and is identified as SMSF.MoReq.SNSSAI.
   - This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic and is used for performance assurance.

2. **Number of Successful MO SMS Delivery Procedures at the SMSF**:
   - This measurement tracks the number of successful MO SMS delivery procedures at the SMSF.
   - A successful delivery procedure is indicated by the SMSF returning a '200 OK' response message, as specified in clause 5.2.2.4 of TS 29.540.
   - Each successful delivery procedure is added to a relevant subcounter per S-NSSAI.
   - The subcounter is represented as an integer value and is identified as SMSF.MoSucc.SNSSAI.
   - This measurement is also valid for packet switched traffic and is used for performance assurance.

Both measurements are crucial for monitoring and ensuring the performance of MO SMS delivery procedures within the 5GS network.","The answer should cover the measurement of MO SMS delivery procedure requests received by the SMSF from the AMF, including the resource URL '/ue-contexts/{supi}/sendsms' and the subcounter per S-NSSAI.

How does the UE and EFTF handle IPv4 and IPv6 packets within the IP packet envelope according to 3GPP TS 24.322 specifications?,"According to 3GPP TS 24.322 specifications, both the User Equipment (UE) and the Enhanced Fixed Terminal Function (EFTF) handle IPv4 and IPv6 packets within the IP packet envelope through a series of defined steps.

To send an IPv4 or IPv6 packet, both the UE and EFTF must create an IP packet envelope as specified in subclause 7.1.2.2. This involves coding the IP packet envelope according to figure 7.1.2.2-1 and table 7.1.2.2-1. The IP packet field within the envelope is populated with either the IPv4 or IPv6 packet. Once the IP packet envelope is created, it is sent as TLS application data over the FTT-IMS.

Upon receiving the IP packet envelope as TLS application data over the FTT-IMS, the UE and EFTF follow similar procedures to handle the packets:

1. If the UE or EFTF supports IPv4 and the field in the four most significant bits of the first octet of the IP packet field of the IP packet envelope contains the value 4, the IP packet is handled as an IPv4 packet according to IETF RFC 791.
2. If the UE or EFTF supports IPv6 and the field in the four most significant bits of the first octet of the IP packet field of the IP packet envelope contains the value 6, the IP packet is handled as an IPv6 packet according to IETF RFC 2460.
3. If the field in the four most significant bits of the first octet of the IP packet field of the IP packet envelope indicates an unsupported IP version, the IP packet envelope is discarded.

The field in the four most significant bits of the first octet of both the IPv4 packet and the IPv6 packet indicates the IP version, ensuring that the UE and EFTF can correctly identify and process the packets based on their IP version.","The answer should include the steps for both UE and EFTF to send and receive IPv4 and IPv6 packets. It should detail the creation of the IP packet envelope, the coding structure of the envelope, and the handling of the packets based on the IP version indicated in the four most significant bits of the first octet. Additionally, it should mention the conditions under which packets are discarded if the IP version is not supported."
Describe the inverse quantization process of LPC for different bitrates as specified in TS 26.445.,"The inverse quantization process of LPC for different bitrates as specified in TS 26.445 is detailed as follows:

- **Low-rate LPC**: The process involves MDCT based TCX which relies on a smoothed LPC spectral envelope. The decoding process of LSF is common to that for ACELP except for the case of 9.6 kbps (NB/WB/SWB). The weighted domain quantized LSF vector is reconstructed using two-stage or three-stage Vector Quantization (VQ) codebooks. In primary decoding, the weighted LSF vector is retrieved from the two-stage VQ, and after adding the mean vector and the MA predicted contribution vector, the reconstructed LSF vector is obtained. This vector corresponds to the weighted envelope and can be directly used for inverse shaping of MDCT coefficients. In secondary decoding, the weighted LSF vector is reconstructed without adding the MA predicted contribution vector, which can inform the shape of the envelope for envelope-based arithmetic coding even when the decoder cannot get information from the previous frame. The conditional third-stage VQ with the addition of the mean vector is applied to the retrieved vector from the two-stage VQ to get the final reconstructed LSF vector. For interpolation between LSF in the possible ACELP at the next frame, the reconstructed LSF vector with MA prediction needs to be converted to an unweighted domain LSF vector. This conversion can be achieved by low-complex direct matrix conversion.

- **Mid-rate LPC**: The inverse quantization process for mid-rate bitrates (13.2 to 32 kbps) is the same as for ACELP, with the quantizer being in AUDIO mode. However, there is a different interpolation method, as described in subclause 5.3.3.2.1.2.

- **High-rate LPC**: The inverse quantization of an LPC filter is performed using the line spectral frequency (LSF) representation. A first-stage approximation is computed by inverse Vector Quantization through a simple table look-up with an 8-bit index. An algebraic vector quantized (AVQ) refinement is then calculated. The quantized LSF vector is reconstructed by adding the first-stage approximation and the inverse-weighted AVQ contribution. Depending on whether the frame is coded as a single TCX20 frame or subdivided into TCX10/TCX5 sub-frames, one or two sets of LPC have to be de-quantized. If two sets are transmitted, the first set is decoded in the same way a single set would be decoded. For the second set, an initial bit signals if it has to be decoded depending on the first set or not. If zero, the first-stage approximation of the second set has to be decoded with another 8-bit inverse Vector Quantizer. If one, the inverse quantized first set will be used as the first-stage approximation. The inverse weights are the reciprocal of the weights used in the encoder. The inverse-quantized LSF vector is subsequently converted into a vector of LSF coefficients, then interpolated and converted again into LPC parameters. The interpolation method is the same as described in subclause 5.3.3.2.1.2.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - For low-rate LPC, explain the MDCT based TCX, the reconstruction of weighted domain quantized LSF vector using VQ codebooks, primary and secondary decoding, and conversion to unweighted domain LSF vector.
  - For mid-rate LPC, describe the similarity to ACELP and the different interpolation method.
  - For high-rate LPC, detail the inverse Vector Quantization, algebraic vector quantized refinement, decoding of single or multiple sets of LPC, and conversion into LPC parameters."
What are the key elements included in the SIP P-Access-Network-Info header for different types of network access as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260?,"The SIP P-Access-Network-Info header includes various elements depending on the type of network access:

- For trusted WLAN access, the header includes the BSSID and, if generated by the P-CSCF or AS based on the retrieved Access Network Information, a Geographical Identifier.
- For untrusted WLAN access, the header includes the BSSID, UE local IP address, ePDG IP Address, and the TCP source port or UDP source port used by the UE to establish the IKEv2 tunnel with the ePDG.
- For 3GPP accesses, the header includes the SAI (Service Area Identifier), TAI (Tracking Area Identifier), RAI (Routing Area Identifier), CGI (Cell Global Identity), ECGI (E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier), and NCGI (NR Cell Global Identifier).
- For other accesses, the header includes specific user location information detailed in TS 24.229 clause 7.2A.4.3.

Additionally, when NR is accessed by the UE via a Dual Connectivity scenario (option 3a/x), the user location is retrieved from EPC, meaning the NCGI is not applicable.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the beam correspondence requirements for power class 5 UEs, including the conditions under which these requirements are applied and the verification rules for UEs supporting multiple types of beam correspondence.","The beam correspondence requirements for power class 5 UEs consist of ensuring the minimum peak Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and spherical coverage. These requirements are verified under specific conditions and rules, especially for UEs supporting multiple types of beam correspondence.

Firstly, the minimum and maximum output power values for EIRP and Total Radiated Power (TRP) are defined, along with spherical coverage requirements. For UEs supporting multiple Frequency Range 2 (FR2) bands, relaxation factors are applied to the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements.

The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE meets one of the following conditions:
1. If the UE supports beam correspondence without uplink beam sweeping, it must meet the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements autonomously without uplink beam sweeping.
2. If the UE supports both beam correspondence without uplink beam sweeping and SSB-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements using the side conditions for SSB-based enhanced beam correspondence.
3. If the UE supports both beam correspondence without uplink beam sweeping and CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements using the side conditions for CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence.

The side conditions for beam correspondence based on SSB include the provision of the downlink reference signal SSB and fulfillment of conditions for L1-RSRP measurements. For CSI-RS-based beam correspondence, the conditions include the provision of both SSB and CSI-RS downlink reference signals, fulfillment of reference measurement channel conditions, and L1-RSRP measurement conditions.

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the following applicability rules apply:
- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements based on either SSB or CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the requirements for both.
- If a UE supports either SSB-based or CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet the supported enhanced beam correspondence requirements.
- If a UE supports both SSB-based and CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet both sets of requirements. Verification involves checking the SSB-based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions and ensuring the minimum peak EIRP requirement using CSI-RS-based side conditions. If the UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement using CSI-RS-based side conditions, further verification is required using CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions.

Describe the structure and components of the API URI for the Nmbsf_MBSUserService service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.580 and TS 29.501.,"The API URI for the Nmbsf_MBSUserService service is structured according to the guidelines provided in 3GPP TS 29.580 and TS 29.501. The general format of the API URI is:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>

The components of this structure are defined as follows:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts, including the scheme ('http' or 'https'), the fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port) as defined in IETF RFC 3986, and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character. The host should be represented by the operator-specific FQDN.
- <apiName>: For the Nmbsf_MBSUserService service, the API name is 'nmbsf-mbs-us'.
- <apiVersion>: The version of the API, which is 'v1' for the Nmbsf_MBSUserService service.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 6.1.3 of 3GPP TS 29.580.

An example of an API URI from another 3GPP document (TS 29.502) is:

How is measurement feedback information utilized in different states for HS-DSCH reception according to 3GPP TS 25.308?,"Measurement feedback information plays a crucial role in optimizing HS-DSCH reception across various states as defined in 3GPP TS 25.308. 

In the CELL_DCH state, measurement feedback information, including the channel quality indicator (CQI), is used by the HS-DSCH serving Node-B to select transport formats and resources. For FDD, the transmission rate of the measurement report to the network is configured by higher layer signalling. In TDD, a measurement report is associated with each HS-SCCH transmission.

In the CELL_FACH state, for both FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD, the measurement results on RACH can be used for link adaptation. In FDD, other measurement feedback information, such as CQI, can be sent if the UE is transmitting on a common E-DCH resource, has successfully resolved collision, and has been configured by the network. The transmission rate of this feedback is also configured by higher layer signalling. In TDD, when the UE is allocated a dedicated H-RNTI, a measurement report is associated with each HS-SCCH transmission.

For HS-DSCH reception in CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states, the UTRAN enables this by including the necessary parameters in the system information broadcast. These parameters include PICH, HS-SCCH, and HS-DSCH configurations. Discontinuous reception (DRX) is supported, allowing the UE to monitor one Page Indicator (PI) in one Paging Occasion per DRX cycle. When HS-DSCH reception is enabled, it takes precedence over S-CCPCH and PCH for paging messages. In CELL_PCH state, HS-DSCH is used to receive BCCH, DCCH, DTCH, and PCCH logical channel data, while in URA_PCH state, it is used for PCCH logical channel data.

The UTRAN configures UEs to store C-RNTIs and dedicated H-RNTIs when performing reconfiguration to CELL_PCH. For UEs with stored identifiers, the network uses the dedicated H-RNTI to transmit DCCH and DTCH. The UE initiates measurement reporting on RRC when receiving the dedicated H-RNTI on HS-SCCH or when it has uplink data to transmit. If the UE is not configured to store these identifiers, the UTRAN sends paging messages on PCCH mapped on HS-DSCH using broadcasted HS-PDSCH codes and transport block sizes.

In CELL_PCH state, the UE monitors the dedicated H-RNTI and BCCH specific H-RNTI on configured HS-SCCH subframes after the paging indication on PICH. In URA_PCH state, the UE monitors the HS-PDSCH code after the paging indication. The BCCH is mapped on HS-DSCH for transmitting system information changes, using BCCH specific H-RNTI on indicated HS-SCCH codes.

The enhanced L2 architecture with flexible RLC PDU size and MAC-ehs segmentation is utilized for HS-DSCH reception in CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states, supporting inter frequency and inter RAT cell reselection. When the UE enters a new cell, it obtains valid HS-SCCH configuration from system information broadcast and performs the Cell Update procedure.","The answer should cover how measurement feedback information is used in different states (CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH) for HS-DSCH reception. It should include details on the configuration of transmission rates, the role of CQI, the use of RACH measurement results, the involvement of higher layer signalling, and the specific procedures for reporting and utilizing these measurements. Additionally, it should explain the system information broadcast parameters, the handling of paging messages, and the enhanced L2 architecture for HS-DSCH reception in CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states."
Describe the procedure that an MCData client should follow upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME body with a FD NETWORK NOTIFICATION message.,"Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME body with a FD NETWORK NOTIFICATION message, the MCData client should follow these steps as detailed in clause 12.4.4 of TS 24.282:

"Describe the procedure for testing SAN (System Antenna Node) according to 3GPP TS 38.181 specifications, highlighting the key steps and parameters involved.","The procedure for testing SAN (System Antenna Node) according to 3GPP TS 38.181 specifications involves several key steps and parameters:

1. **Placement and Alignment**: Place the SAN with its manufacturer-declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the calibrated point in the test system. Align the manufacturer-declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN with the test system.

2. **Configuration of the Wanted Signal**: Configure the characteristics of the wanted signal according to TS 38.211 and additional test parameters listed in the relevant tables (e.g., Table 11.3.2.1.4.2-1 or Table 11.3.2.2.4.2-1).

3. **Configuration of Multipath Fading Emulators**: Configure the multipath fading emulators according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

4. **Adjustment of Test Signal Mean Power**: Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR value at the SAN receiver is as specified for SAN type 1-O, ensuring that the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor. The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level specified in the relevant tables (e.g., Table 11.3.2.1.4.2-2 or Table 11.3.2.2.4.2-2).

5. **Transmission of Demodulation Branch Signals**: Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators, and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup. Each of the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).

6. **AWGN Power Level Settings**: Set the AWGN power level at the SAN input as specified in the relevant tables.

7. **Statistics Collection**: The signal generator sends random codewords from the applicable codebook at regular time periods. Statistics are collected for the number of ACK bits detected in idle periods and the number of NACK bits detected as ACK. Additionally, statistics are kept for falsely detected ACK bits in idle periods and missed ACK bits, with each error accounted for in the respective statistics.

"Describe the handover procedures from GAN to GERAN/UTRAN, including the conditions that trigger handover, the information elements involved, and the actions taken by the MS in case of handover failure.","The handover procedures from GAN to GERAN/UTRAN involve several conditions and steps as specified in the documents. 

The conditions that trigger handover from GAN to GERAN/UTRAN include:
- Local measurements of GAN coverage signal quality.
- Reception of a GA-CSR UPLINK QUALITY INDICATION message indicating poor uplink quality. If the message indicates a 'Network problem,' a handover to GERAN or UTRAN should be attempted. If it indicates a 'Radio problem' or 'Undetermined problem,' a search for a new access point should be done before initiating the handover.
- Reception of RTCP packets indicating poor uplink quality.
- Excessive loss or delay in the received RTP packets.

When the MS decides to trigger the handover from GAN A/Gb mode, it sends a GA-CSR HANDOVER INFORMATION message to the network. This message includes a list of candidate/target cell identifiers ranked in order of preference, based on the most recent list available from other radio access technologies (e.g., GSM RR), and includes the received signal strength for each identified GERAN or UTRAN cell. The MS may include GERAN cells, UTRAN cells, or both, as permitted by the Handover Reporting Control IE.

The Handover Reporting Control information element provides the MS with information concerning which cells/RATs may be reported during handover initiation. The HO_2G and HO_3G indications specify whether a mobile may indicate a 2G or 3G cell as part of the handover initiation procedure.

For PS handover from GAN A/Gb mode, if supported by both the MS and the GANC, it may be used to prevent an MS from performing an autonomous rove-out from GAN A/Gb mode. PS handover may be triggered by the MS based on:
- Local measurements of GAN coverage signal quality.
- User-initiated change of operational mode to GERAN/UTRAN preferred or GERAN/UTRAN only.
- Reception of a GA-PSR UPLINK QUALITY INDICATION message indicating unacceptable uplink performance, network problem, or unknown problem.

Upon experiencing any of these trigger conditions, the MS may trigger the PS handover procedure by sending a GA-PSR HANDOVER INFORMATION message. This message includes a list of candidate GERAN/UTRAN cells ranked in order of preference, based on the most recent lists available from the candidate radio access technologies, and includes the received signal strength for each identified GERAN or UTRAN cell.

In case of PS handover failure, the MS takes specific actions:
- If timer TU4004 expires, the MS shall either rove-out to GERAN/UTRAN mode or remain in GAN A/Gb mode if the conditions that caused the MS to initiate PS handover have been resolved.
- If the MS is unable to act on the GA-PSR HANDOVER COMMAND message, it shall discard it, send a GA-PSR HANDOVER FAILURE message to the source GANC, and resume normal operation. The cause value in the failure message shall be set to 'PS handover failure - incorrect handover command.'
- If the MS is able to act on the GA-PSR HANDOVER COMMAND message but is unable to establish the radio connection towards the target RAT, it shall return to the old cell, send a GA-PSR HANDOVER FAILURE message, and resume normal operation. The cause value shall be set to 'PS handover failure - target RAT access failure.'
- For PS handover to a GERAN cell, if the GA-PSR HANDOVER COMMAND message does not contain the minimum set of PSI or SI messages required for the MS to operate in the new cell, the MS shall send a GA-PSR HANDOVER FAILURE message and resume normal operation. The cause value shall be set to 'PS handover failure - missing SI/PSI information.'
- If the PS HANDOVER COMMAND message does not provide resources for at least one uplink TBF in the new cell, the MS shall send a GA-PSR HANDOVER FAILURE message and resume normal operation. The cause value shall be set to 'PS handover failure - no uplink TBF allocation.'","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The conditions that trigger handover from GAN to GERAN/UTRAN, including local measurements, reception of quality indication messages, RTCP packets, and excessive loss or delay in RTP packets.
  - The role of the GA-CSR HANDOVER INFORMATION message and the list of candidate cells, including the received signal strength for each identified cell.
  - The Handover Reporting Control information element and its role in specifying which cells/RATs may be reported during handover initiation.

"Explain the key aspects of NR sidelink communication as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331, particularly focusing on the PC5-RRC connection, the role of sidelink SRBs, and the security mechanisms involved.","NR sidelink communication, as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331, includes unicast, groupcast, and broadcast communication. For unicast communication, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID in the Access Stratum (AS). This connection can be initiated after the establishment of the corresponding PC5 unicast link.

The PC5-RRC connection utilizes various sidelink Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) for different purposes:
- SL-SRB0 is used to transmit PC5-S messages before PC5-S security is established.
- SL-SRB1 is used to transmit PC5-S messages to establish PC5-S security.
- SL-SRB2 is used to transmit protected PC5-S messages after PC5-S security is established.
- SL-SRB3 is used to transmit protected PC5-RRC signalling after PC5-S security is established.
- SL-SRB4 is used to transmit/receive NR sidelink discovery messages.

For unicast NR sidelink communication, AS security includes integrity protection and ciphering of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms and parameters are exchanged via PC5-S messages in the upper layers and applied to the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated, all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and user data on SL-DRBs are integrity protected and/or ciphered by the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP).

If a key change is indicated by the upper layers, the UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3, and SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.

Several notes provide additional context:
- Configurations for NR sidelink communication acquired via E-UTRA are provided by SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration.
- There is a one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link.
- All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same activation/deactivation settings for ciphering and integrity protection.
- When an integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers.
- The selection of NULL algorithms means that the PC5 messages are considered protected for the purposes of being allowed to be sent or received.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The types of NR sidelink communication (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).

"Describe the requirements for AAS BS in terms of radiated and conducted points of reference, co-location requirements, and regional emission limits for E-UTRA bands.","The requirements for Active Antenna System Base Stations (AAS BS) are defined in terms of radiated and conducted points of reference, co-location requirements, and regional emission limits for E-UTRA bands.

Radiated and conducted points of reference for AAS BS are crucial for understanding the system's performance. Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) at the radiated interface boundary (RIB), and these requirements are referred to as OTA requirements. The directions in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement. Conducted characteristics, on the other hand, are defined at individual or groups of TAB connectors at the transceiver array boundary, which is the conducted interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna. The transceiver unit array generates modulated transmit signal structures and performs receiver combining and demodulation, containing an implementation-specific number of transmitter and receiver units. The composite antenna includes a radio distribution network (RDN) and an antenna array, distributing RF power and radio signals in an implementation-specific way.

Co-location requirements ensure that AAS BS can operate with minimal degradation when co-located with another BS of the same class. These requirements include unwanted emissions and out-of-band blocking, which are optional based on declaration, while TX OFF and TX IMD are mandatory as they represent worst-case interference scenarios. The co-location reference antenna must be a single column passive antenna with the same vertical radiating dimension, frequency range, polarization, and nominal 65° horizontal half-power beamwidth as the composite antenna of AAS BS. It is placed at a distance of 0.1 m from the edge of the AAS BS and aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction. For dual polarization AAS BS, the co-location reference antenna has two conducted interfaces representing each polarization.

Regional emission limits for E-UTRA bands are specified to protect other systems operating in the same geographical area. These limits may be optional or mandatory based on local or regional regulations. For E-UTRA bands below 1 GHz, emissions must not exceed the levels specified in Table 9.7.5.4.6.1-1. For bands above 1 GHz, the limits are detailed in Table 9.7.5.4.6.1-2, and for specific bands like 12, 13, 14, 17, 29, 71, and 85, the limits are in Table 9.7.5.4.6.1-3. Additionally, for E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT, and NB-IoT TDD BS operating in the same geographic area and band as another E-UTRA TDD system without synchronization, emissions must not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported downlink operating band, except within 10 MHz below the lower channel edge to 10 MHz above the upper channel edge of each supported band.","The answer must include a detailed explanation of the radiated and conducted points of reference for AAS BS, including the definitions and characteristics of each. It should cover the co-location requirements, specifying the types of emissions and the setup of the co-location reference antenna. Additionally, the answer should outline the regional emission limits for various E-UTRA bands, specifying the bands and the conditions under which these limits apply."

"Describe the procedures and actions taken by the RNC in the event of user-out-of-service information, signalling-point-inaccessible information, SCCP connection release, or RNSAP signalling bearer failure as per 3GPP TS 25.420 and TS 25.423.","In the event of user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible information being received by the RNSAP, the RNC will not initiate any new attempts to establish SCCP connections or send SCCP Connectionless messages towards the affected signalling point until the corresponding user-in-service or signalling-point-accessible information is received. Additionally, an optional timer may be started when such information is received. If the timer expires, the RNC will take actions as described in TS 25.423 Annex D.1.1. The timer is stopped upon receiving user-in-service or signalling-point-accessible information.

"Describe the architecture reference models for GTP-based interfaces in 3GPP specifications, focusing on the separation of control and user planes, and the specific reference points involved.","The architecture reference models for GTP-based interfaces in 3GPP specifications are designed to support the separation of control and user planes for Serving Gateway (SGW), Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW), and Traffic Detection Function (TDF). This separation is crucial for optimizing network performance and flexibility. The supported reference points for these models include S2a, S2b, S5, and S8, which are used in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios.

For non-roaming scenarios, the architecture reference model is depicted in Figure 4.2.1-1, which shows the separation between control plane and user plane. This model also applies to home routed and local breakout roaming scenarios. The suffixes -C and -U appended to S2a, S2b, S5, and S8 indicate the control plane and user plane components of those interfaces. Additionally, the architecture supports cases where only one node's control and user plane functions are split, while the other interfacing node's functions are not.

Complementary reference points added to the existing models include Sxa (between SGW-C and SGW-U), Sxb (between PGW-C and PGW-U), and Sxc (between TDF-C and TDF-U). These reference points enhance the flexibility and scalability of the network architecture.

In roaming scenarios, various architectures are defined, such as those using S8, S2a, S2b, S5, and S2c. For example, Figure 4.2.3-1 shows the roaming architecture for EPS using S8, S2a, and S2b in a home routed configuration. PMIP-based interfaces are also considered, with specific notes on QoS enforcement and policy signaling. For instance, Gxc is used only in the case of PMIP-based S8 and for 3GPP access, while Gxa is used for Trusted non-3GPP IP Access owned by the same operator.

Emergency services are supported by non-roaming architectures and specific roaming architectures with the visited operator's application function, as shown in Figure 4.2.2-3. Other roaming architectures with services provided by the home network do not apply for emergency services.

A Network Function (NF) service is a capability exposed by a NF (referred to as the NF Service Producer) to other authorized NFs (referred to as NF Service Consumers) through a service-based interface. These NF services can support one or more NF service operations. Each NF service offered by a Network Function is self-contained and can be managed independently from other NF services provided by the same Network Function. This independent management is crucial for operations such as scaling and healing.

Additionally, the concept of ManagedNFService represents a NF service, emphasizing its role in the overall architecture. ManagedNFService is defined in relation to NF services as per clause 7 of 3GPP TS 23.501, highlighting its importance in the management and operation of NF services within the 5G System Architecture.

"Describe the structure and key elements of the GTP header as defined in 3GPP TS 29.060, including the handling of unsupported GTP versions.","The GTP header is a variable length header used for both the GTP-C and GTP-U protocols, with a minimum length of 8 bytes. The header includes several always present fields: 
- Version field: Indicates the version of the GTP protocol, which should be set to '1'.
- Protocol Type (PT): Discriminates between GTP (PT is '1') and GTP' (PT is '0').
- Extension Header flag (E): Indicates the presence of the Next Extension Header field.

- N-PDU Number: Used in certain inter-system handover procedures to coordinate data transmission.
- Next Extension Header Type: Defines the type of Extension Header that follows.

The GTP header uses three flags (PN, S, E) to signal the presence of additional optional fields. If any of these flags are set, the corresponding fields must be present. Unused fields should be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

The format of Extension Headers is defined, with the Extension Header Length field specifying the length in 4 octet units and the Next Extension Header Type field indicating the type of any following Extension Header. Unknown Extension Types are handled based on bits 7 and 8 of the Next Extension Header Type, with specific actions required if comprehension is required.

Describe the mechanisms and protocols defined for the transport of CDR files from the CGF to the BD as per 3GPP TS 32.297.,"The transport of CDR files from the CGF to the BD as per 3GPP TS 32.297 is defined through two primary mechanisms and an optional protocol. 

Firstly, the basic transport mechanism, as outlined in clause 5.3.1, mandates the use of FTP (RFC 959 [400]) as the default protocol for CDR file transport. This mechanism requires that all CGF implementations support FTP, although the use of other protocols is optional. FTP commands specified in RFC 959 must be supported, and CDR files can be transferred in either push or pull mode on the Bx interface, with further specifications provided in clauses 5.4.1 and 5.4.2.

Secondly, the File Transfer IRP, described in clause 5.3.2, may be supported as an implementation option. The File Transfer IRP is specified in TS 32.341 [201], TS 32.342 [202], TS 32.343 [203], and TS 32.344 [204]. The choice of solution sets (CORBA, CMIP, or both) is left to the implementation, and the CGF must comply with these TSs without further additions or limitations regarding its use in charging.

Additionally, the use of IPDR, as described in clause 5.3.3, may optionally be supported on the Bx reference point. IPDR file transfer and streaming protocols are detailed in ATIS-PP-0300075.1.200X [401], IPDR/File Transfer Protocol [402], and IPDR/SP [403].

- The optional support for IPDR on the Bx reference point, including details on file transfer and streaming protocols.
- The requirements for FTP commands and the support for push and pull modes on the Bx interface."
"Describe the process and conditions under which an MCPTT client cancels an in-progress emergency condition on a prearranged MCPTT group, including the necessary SIP MESSAGE request details and the handling of responses.","The process for an MCPTT client to cancel an in-progress emergency condition on a prearranged MCPTT group involves several steps and conditions. Initially, the MCPTT client must determine if the MCPTT user is authorized to cancel the emergency state based on local policy, such as whether the requester is a dispatcher or the initiator of the emergency group call.

If the user is authorized, the MCPTT client generates a SIP MESSAGE request. This request must include specific headers and MIME body elements:
1. The ICSI value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt' in a P-Preferred-Service header field.
2. An Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt' along with 'require' and 'explicit' parameters.
3. Optionally, a P-Preferred-Identity header field containing the public user identity of the originator.
4. An application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body with the <mcpttinfo> element containing the <mcptt-Params> element, including:
   - The <mcptt-request-uri> element set to the MCPTT group identity.
   - The <emergency-ind> element set to 'false'.
   - If requested, the <alert-ind> element set to 'false'.

The Request-URI must be set to the public service identity identifying the participating MCPTT function serving the MCPTT user. If the SIP MESSAGE request contains an <alert-ind> element, the MCPTT emergency alert state is set to 'MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending'.

Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request with an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body:
1. If the <emergency-ind> element is 'false', the MCPTT emergency group state is set to 'MEG 1: no-emergency'.
2. If the <alert-ind> element is 'true' and the emergency alert state is 'MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending', the state is set to 'MEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated'.
3. If the <alert-ind> element is 'false' and the emergency alert state is 'MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending', the state is set to 'MEA 1: no-alert' and the emergency state is cleared.

If the MCPTT client receives a SIP 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx response containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml MIME body with the <alert-ind> element set to 'true' and the emergency alert state is 'MEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending', the state is set to 'MEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated'.","Key details the answer must include:

"Explain the process and conditions under which CFNRc information is passed from the HLR to the VLR, including the handling of different service states and formats.","The process and conditions under which CFNRc (Call Forwarding on Not Reachable) information is passed from the HLR (Home Location Register) to the VLR (Visitor Location Register) involve several key factors, including the provisioning and registration states of CFNRc, the logical state of the service, and the format of the forwarded-to number.

1. **Provisioning and Registration States**:
   - If CFNRc is 'Provisioned', the HLR sends the VLR information about the logical state of CFNRc for all relevant elementary basic service groups when the subscriber registers on a VLR.
   - If CFNRc is 'Registered', the HLR sends the VLR the registration parameter 'forwarded-to number' and information about subscription options such as 'notification to the calling party' and 'MSISDN of the served subscriber can be presented to the forwarded-to subscriber'.

2. **Logical State Changes**:
   - If the logical state or the registration parameter 'forwarded-to number' of CFNRc changes while a subscriber is registered on a VLR, the HLR informs the VLR of the new logical state or registration parameter.
   - If the subscription options change while the subscriber is registered and CFNRc is 'Registered', the HLR updates the VLR with the new subscription option information.

3. **Service State Information for Phase 1 VLRs**:
   - When passing CFNRc information to a Phase 1 VLR, the HLR translates the service state information based on the logical state held in the HLR. For example:
     - (Provisioned, Not Registered, Not Active, Not Induced) => Erased, Deactivated
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Not Active, Not Induced) => Registered, Deactivated
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Operative, Not Induced) => Registered, Activated
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Quiescent, Not Induced) => Registered, Deactivated
   - The HLR does not pass a subaddress to a Phase 1 VLR.

4. **Handling of Forwarded-to Numbers for VLRs Not Supporting CAMEL or Supporting CAMEL Phase 1 Only**:
   - The HLR sends the 'forwarded-to number' only if it is in an international format. If the number is not in an international format, the HLR modifies the service state information as follows:
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Not Active, Not Induced) => (Provisioned, Not Registered, Not Active, Not Induced)
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Operative, Not Induced) => (Provisioned, Not Registered, Not Active, Not Induced)
     - (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Quiescent, Not Induced) => (Provisioned, Not Registered, Not Active, Not Induced)
   - No forwarded-to number is passed to the VLR in these cases, and the modification of the service state information sent to the VLR does not impact the service state information stored in the HLR.

In summary, the HLR sends CFNRc information to the VLR based on the provisioning and registration states, logical state changes, and the format of the forwarded-to number. The HLR also translates service state information for Phase 1 VLRs and handles forwarded-to numbers appropriately for VLRs not supporting CAMEL or supporting CAMEL Phase 1 only.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The conditions under which the HLR sends CFNRc information to the VLR, including provisioning and registration states.
- The specific information sent by the HLR to the VLR, such as logical state, forwarded-to number, and subscription options.
- The translation of service state information for Phase 1 VLRs based on logical states.
- The handling of forwarded-to numbers in international format for VLRs not supporting CAMEL or supporting CAMEL Phase 1 only.
- The impact of service state modifications on the information stored in the HLR."
"Describe the enhancements supported by NG-RAN for MUSIM device operation, including the mechanisms for paging collision avoidance and network switching notifications.","NG-RAN supports several enhancements for MUSIM (Multiple USIM) device operation to improve efficiency and performance. These enhancements include Paging Collision Avoidance and UE (User Equipment) notification on Network Switching.

Paging Collision Avoidance is designed to address the issue of overlapping paging occasions on both USIMs when a MUSIM device is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state in both networks associated with the respective USIMs. For instance, Network A could be NR (New Radio) and Network B could be either E-UTRA (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) or NR. A MUSIM device can determine potential paging collisions on the two networks and trigger actions to prevent these collisions on the NR network. The specific actions to prevent paging collisions are detailed in TS 23.501, and it is up to the UE implementation to select one of the two RATs (Radio Access Technologies) or networks for paging collision avoidance.

For network switching notifications, a MUSIM device in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A (NR) may need to switch to Network B, which can be either E-UTRA or NR. Before switching, the MUSIM device should notify Network A whether it will leave the RRC_CONNECTED state or remain in it while temporarily switching to Network B. This notification can be done using RRC (Radio Resource Control) signaling or NAS (Non-Access Stratum) signaling. If the device signals a preference to leave the RRC_CONNECTED state and does not receive an RRCRelease message from Network A within a configured time period, it can enter the RRC_IDLE state in Network A.

Additionally, a MUSIM device can signal a preference to temporarily switch to Network B while remaining in the RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A. This is indicated by scheduling gaps preference, which can include information for the setup or release of gaps. Network A can configure up to four gap patterns for MUSIM purposes: three periodic gaps and one aperiodic gap. Network A should provide at least one of the requested gap patterns or no gaps, but providing an alternative gap pattern instead of the one requested by the UE is not supported in this release.

These enhancements ensure that MUSIM devices can efficiently manage their connections and avoid potential issues such as paging collisions and unnecessary disconnections during network switching.","The answer should include:
  - A brief overview of NG-RAN enhancements for MUSIM devices.
  - Detailed explanation of Paging Collision Avoidance, including the states involved and the role of UE implementation.
  - Detailed explanation of UE notification on Network Switching, including the signaling methods, preferences for RRC state, and configuration of gap patterns."
Describe the decision-making process for switching between different modes of operation for V2V communications in V2X services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.286 and TS 36.300.,"The decision-making process for switching between different modes of operation for V2V communications in V2X services involves several key factors and steps. According to 3GPP TS 23.286, the V2X UE (User Equipment) is responsible for making the decision to switch between direct (PC5) and indirect (Uu) modes of operation for V2V communications. This decision is influenced by the V2V service KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) as specified in 3GPP TS 22.186. 

The V2X application layer plays a supportive role by providing network monitoring information or recommendations to assist the V2X UE in making the switching decision. The V2X UE evaluates several factors, including the received network monitoring information, PC5 communication quality information, and assistance information from the VAE (V2X Application Entity) server. 

The specifications for the mode of operation switching for V2V sessions are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.300.

"What are the key requirements and specifications for Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) in 3GPP documents TS 25.104, TS 25.105, TS 25.141, and TS 37.105?","Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to receive a desired signal at its assigned channel frequency while rejecting an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset. According to TS 25.104, ACS is defined as the ratio of the receiver filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receiver filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s). The interference signal is offset from the desired signal by a frequency offset Fuw, and it must be a W-CDMA signal as specified in Annex C. For Base Stations (BS) operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the ACS requirement applies inside any sub-block gap if the gap size is at least 5MHz, with the interfering signal offset defined as -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz relative to the sub-block edges. Similarly, for BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap of at least 5MHz, with the same offset definitions.

TS 25.105 provides a similar definition of ACS but specifies that the interfering signal is a single code CDMA modulated adjacent channel signal. 

TS 25.141 references the minimum ACS requirements specified in TS 25.104 clause 7.4.

TS 37.105 outlines the minimum ACS requirements for different classes of Base Stations. For single RAT UTRA FDD AAS BS of Wide Area, Medium Range, and Local Area BS classes, the requirements specified in TS 25.104 clause 7.4 must be met. For single RAT UTRA TDD AAS BS of Wide Area and Local Area BS classes, the requirements specified in TS 25.105 clause 7.4 must be fulfilled.

Explain the different types of ProSe codes defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 and their roles in ProSe direct discovery model B.,"In 3GPP TS 23.003, several types of ProSe codes are defined, each playing a specific role in the ProSe direct discovery model B. 

1. **ProSe Restricted Code**: As described in clause 24.6, the ProSe Restricted Code is a single 64-bit identifier that corresponds to one or more Restricted ProSe Application User IDs. This identifier is used to facilitate restricted ProSe communications, although its exact content is not specified in the 3GPP documentation.

2. **ProSe Query Code**: According to clause 24.9, the ProSe Query Code is a ProSe Restricted Code allocated by the ProSe Function to the Discoverer UE (User Equipment) for the purpose of restricted ProSe direct discovery model B. The format of the ProSe Query Code is identical to that of the ProSe Restricted Code defined in clause 24.6.

3. **ProSe Response Code**: As outlined in clause 24.10, the ProSe Response Code is another type of ProSe Restricted Code allocated by the ProSe Function, but this time to the Discoveree UE for restricted ProSe direct discovery model B. Similar to the ProSe Query Code, the format of the ProSe Response Code is the same as the ProSe Restricted Code defined in clause 24.6.

In summary, all these codes are 64-bit identifiers used in the context of restricted ProSe direct discovery model B, with the ProSe Query Code allocated to the Discoverer UE and the ProSe Response Code allocated to the Discoveree UE. The format of these codes remains consistent across their different applications.","The answer should include the definitions and roles of the ProSe Restricted Code, ProSe Query Code, and ProSe Response Code.

How should Open API specification files be named and stored according to 3GPP TS 29.122?,"According to 3GPP TS 29.122, each API must be described in a separate Open API specification file, and these files must comply with the OpenAPI specification. All Open API specification files should be stored in the same directory on the local server. The naming convention for these files includes several components: the 3GPP specification number in the format 'Tsxxyyy', an underscore character, the API name as defined for corresponding base URL parts (if the file contains an API definition), or the string 'CommonData' (if the file contains a definition of common data types), followed by the '.yaml' extension.

Describe the mechanisms and processes involved in capability and content negotiation for MExE devices as defined in 3GPP TS 23.057.,"The mechanisms and processes involved in capability and content negotiation for MExE devices are defined comprehensively in 3GPP TS 23.057. 

Firstly, the user profile plays a crucial role in defining the behavior of MExE devices. It acts as a repository that is always available in the MExE device, supporting preferences and personalisation aspects such as UMTS portability and VHE support. The user profile is based on the Composite Capability/Preference Profile (CC/PP) specification from W3C, which uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for interoperable encoding of preferences. The user profile includes various personalisation aspects like user interface personalisation, service personalisation and management, and generic service management information. The UAProf schema defines mandatory and recommended properties for user preference information, which MExE devices should support.

Capability negotiation is mandatory for all MExE devices, while content negotiation is optional. Interaction between the MExE device and the Mobile Service Environment (MSE) for browsing and service discovery is supported by HTTP/1.1 or an HTTP/1.1 derived protocol like WSP. Capability negotiation occurs when the MExE device first connects to the MSE, informing the MSE of its capabilities. This negotiation helps both entities understand the specific mechanisms and support each can provide. Capability negotiation typically happens before any content transfer and can be initiated spontaneously by the MExE device if its capabilities change.

Content negotiation, on the other hand, is used to select the best representation of an entity when multiple representations are available. This negotiation can be server-driven or agent-driven, using HTTP/1.1 or WSP methods. The client application connects to a URI to access the entity, and the negotiation optimizes the content according to the client's capabilities. The methods for content negotiation include using HTTP/1.1 or WSP request headers such as User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, and Accept-Language.

In summary, capability negotiation informs the MSE of the MExE device's capabilities, while content negotiation optimizes the content based on these capabilities. Both processes aim to enhance the interaction and service experience for the user.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the user profile in MExE device behavior and personalisation, including the use of CC/PP and RDF for encoding preferences.
  - The mandatory nature of capability negotiation and optional nature of content negotiation, including the protocols used (HTTP/1.1, WSP) and the initial contact requirements.
  - How capability negotiation informs the MSE of the MExE device's capabilities and how changes in device capabilities affect user preferences support.
  - The methods and headers used for content negotiation, and the purpose of these negotiations in optimizing content according to the client's capabilities."
Describe the mechanisms and requirements for Subscribe-Notify service operations between Network Functions (NFs) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 and TS 23.501.,"Subscribe-Notify service operations between Network Functions (NFs) require bidirectional communication and are supported with two TCP connections, one per direction. The NF service consumer acts as an HTTP client and the NF service producer acts as an HTTP server when the consumer subscribes to the producer's notifications. Conversely, the NF service producer acts as an HTTP client and the NF service consumer acts as an HTTP server when the producer delivers notifications to the consumer.

For these operations, the NF Service Consumer must provide a 'notification endpoint' and a 'notification correlation ID', also referred to as 'callback URI'. The authority of the callback URI is the HTTP endpoint where notifications are delivered by the NF Service Producer. In Direct Communication scenarios, if the callback URI contains a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), DNS is used for resolution to set up the TCP connection. In Indirect Communication scenarios, specific headers and routing mechanisms are employed.

Indirect communication requires the inclusion of a 3gpp-Sbi-Callback header in notification and callback requests, which helps the Service Communication Proxy (SCP) identify these requests and apply differentiated treatments, such as authorization processes. The NF service producer may include the NRF API URI for NF service consumer reselection in the 3gpp-Sbi-Nrf-Uri header if previously received from the consumer.

The end-to-end interaction between NFs follows two mechanisms: Request-response and Subscribe-Notify. In Request-response, the NF Service Consumer requests a service from the NF Service Producer, which responds within a certain timeframe. In Subscribe-Notify, the NF Service Consumer subscribes to notifications from the NF Service Producer, which sends notifications based on the subscription request. The subscription request must include the notification endpoint and correlation ID.

Binding Indications can be used in both mechanisms to help discover suitable NF service producer instances or notification endpoints. Subscription methods include explicit subscription, implicit subscription, and default notification endpoint registration. In indirect communication, the SCP routes messages based on the Routing Binding Indication and may perform discovery and selection of NF service producers on behalf of the consumer.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of bidirectional communication and TCP connections for Subscribe-Notify operations
  - Roles of NF service consumer and producer in HTTP communication
  - Requirements for notification endpoint and correlation ID (callback URI)
  - Use of DNS resolution for Direct Communication scenarios

"What are the performance criteria for base stations, ancillary equipment, and repeaters as defined in TS 25.113?","The performance criteria for different types of equipment as defined in TS 25.113 are as follows:

1. **Base Stations**: According to subclause 6.1, the test should be performed using a bearer with the characteristics of data rate and BLER defined in Table 1. If the test is not performed using one of these bearers, the characteristics of the bearer used must be recorded in the test report. The BS Uplink and Downlink paths must each meet the performance criteria defined in Table 1 during the test. If evaluated as one loop, the criteria is two times the value shown in Table 1. After each test case, the BS must operate as intended with no loss of user control function, stored data, and the communication link must be maintained. The performance criteria include BLER < 10^-2 and no loss of service, even if a bearer with different characteristics is used.

2. **Ancillary Equipment**: As per subclause 6.4, the apparatus must continue to operate as intended during and after the test. No degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the performance level specified by the manufacturer when the apparatus is used as intended. If the minimum performance level or permissible performance loss is not specified by the manufacturer, it may be derived from the product description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect from the apparatus if used as intended.

3. **Repeaters**: Subclause 6.7 specifies that the gain of the EUT must be measured throughout the period of exposure to the phenomenon. The gain measured during the test must not change from the gain measured before the test by more than ±1 dB. At the conclusion of the test, the EUT must operate as intended with no loss of user control functions or stored data.

Subclauses 9.3.3 and 9.6.3 reiterate that these performance criteria apply to base stations, ancillary equipment, and repeaters respectively.","The answer should include the specific performance criteria for each type of equipment (base stations, ancillary equipment, and repeaters) as defined in the relevant subclauses of TS 25.113. For base stations, it should cover the data rate, BLER, and maintaining communication link as per subclause 6.1. For ancillary equipment, it should address the requirement to operate as intended with no degradation of performance or loss of function as per subclause 6.4. For repeaters, it should include the gain measurement criteria and maintaining user control functions as per subclause 6.7."
"How does the MSC Server handle early media, ringback tones, and announcements in the IM CN subsystem?","The MSC Server handles early media, ringback tones, and announcements in the IM CN subsystem based on specific conditions and procedures. 

For early media, the MSC Server may instruct the CS-MGW to apply ringback tone or an announcement if the MSC Server supports the P-Early-Media header as a network option and the P-Early-Media header was received in the initial INVITE request. If these conditions are met, the MSC Server includes a P-Early-Media header authorizing backward early media in the 183 Session Progress response before applying an announcement, or in the 180 Ringing response before applying ringback tone.

When the condition for early media is fulfilled, the MSC Server instructs the CS-MGW to send ringing tone towards the calling party using the Send Tone procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 29.232. If the MSC Server wishes to stop sending the ringing tone, for example, upon receipt of the CONNECT message, it applies the Stop Tone procedure as defined in the same documents.

Similarly, if the MSC Server wants to provide an announcement when the early media condition is fulfilled, it instructs the CS-MGW to send an announcement using the Play Announcement procedure in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 29.232. To stop sending the announcement, the MSC Server applies the Stop Announcement procedure as defined in these documents.","The answer should include the conditions under which the MSC Server applies early media, ringback tone, or announcements, specifically mentioning the P-Early-Media header requirements. It should detail the procedures for sending and stopping ringing tones and announcements, referencing the relevant 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 29.232 documents."
Describe the format and usage of the Network Access Identifier (NAI) for non-5G capable over WLAN (N5CW) devices when registering to the 5G Core Network (5GCN) via a trusted non-3GPP access network.,"The Network Access Identifier (NAI) for non-5G capable over WLAN (N5CW) devices when registering to the 5G Core Network (5GCN) via a trusted non-3GPP access network follows a specific format: '<5G_device_unique_identity>@nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org'. 

The username part '<5G_device_unique_identity>' is used to identify the N5CW device and can contain either:
- SUCI (Subscription Concealed Identifier) if the device is not registered to 5GCN via NG-RAN.
- 5G-GUTI (5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier) if the device is registered to 5GCN via NG-RAN.

The realm part '5gc-nn' indicates that the NAI is used by N5CW devices via trusted non-3GPP access. The Mobile Network Code (MNC) and Mobile Country Code (MCC) identify the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), which can be either the Home PLMN (HPLMN) or the Visited PLMN (VPLMN) to which the N5CW device attempts to connect.

In roaming scenarios, the NAI should contain both the VPLMN ID and the HPLMN ID, requiring the use of a decorated NAI format.

The authentication process for N5CW devices uses EAP-AKA' (Extensible Authentication Protocol-Authentication and Key Agreement), which relies on the USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) that stores the HPLMN identity.","The answer should include the following key details:

What are the minimum conformance requirements for PSCell activation and deactivation delay as specified in TS 38.533?,"The minimum conformance requirements for PSCell activation and deactivation delay as specified in TS 38.533 include several key components and conditions. For PSCell activation, the overall delay formula is given by Tactivation_time = TRRC_delay + Tprocessing + Tsearch + T∆ + TIU + 2 ms. Each component of this delay is defined as follows:

- TRRC_delay: This is the RRC procedure delay as specified in TS 38.331.
- Tprocessing: This is the software processing time needed by the UE, including RF warm-up period. If any PSCell parameter is modified during activation, Tprocessing is 20 ms; otherwise, it is either 5 ms or 10 ms.
- Tsearch: This is the time for AGC settling and PSS/SSS detection. For RACH-based PSCell activation, Tsearch varies depending on whether the target cell is known or unknown and its frequency range (FR1 or FR2). For RACH-less based PSCell activation, Tsearch is 0 ms if the target cell is a known FR2 PSCell.
- T∆: This is the time for fine time tracking and acquiring full timing information of the target PSCell, defined as 1*Trs ms.
- TIU: This is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the PSCell for RACH-based activation, or the first PUSCH transmission occasion for RACH-less activation.

Trs is the SMTC periodicity of the PSCell, which depends on the configuration provided to the UE. If no specific configuration is provided, Trs is assumed to be 5 ms.

A PSCell is considered known in FR1 and FR2 if, during the last 5 seconds before the reception of the SCG activation command, the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the PSCell being activated and one of the SSBs measured from the PSCell remains detectable according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 9.3.

For PSCell deactivation, upon receiving the SCG deactivation command in subframe n, the UE must accomplish the deactivation actions specified in TS 38.331 no later than in slot TRRC_delay. The normative reference for these requirements is TS 36.133, clause 7.38.2 and 7.38.3.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The overall delay formula for PSCell activation (Tactivation_time = TRRC_delay + Tprocessing + Tsearch + T∆ + TIU + 2 ms).
  - Definitions and values for each component of the delay (TRRC_delay, Tprocessing, Tsearch, T∆, TIU, Trs).
  - Conditions under which the PSCell is considered known or unknown in FR1 and FR2.
  - Requirements for PSCell deactivation delay and the normative references for these requirements."
Describe the process and rules for erasing different types of call forwarding services.,"The process and rules for erasing different types of call forwarding services are outlined as follows:

1. **Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)**:
   - **Rules**: A previous registration can be erased by the subscriber through a control procedure, by registering new CFU information which overrides previous registrations, or by administrative handling resulting in the withdrawal of the supplementary service.
   - **Process Flow**: The erasure request is initiated by the Mobile Station (MS) and sent to the Mobile Switching Center (MSC), which forwards it to the Visitor Location Register (VLR) and then to the Home Location Register (HLR). The HLR acknowledges the erasure, and this acknowledgment is propagated back to the MS.
   - **Interaction Checks**: Interaction with other supplementary services must be checked.
   - **Notification**: The network sends an indication of acceptance or rejection of the erasure request to the served mobile station.

2. **Call Forwarding on Mobile Subscriber Busy (CFB)**:
   - **Rules**: The same rules apply as for CFU, but no checks for interaction with other supplementary services are required.
   - **Process Flow**: Similar to CFU, the erasure request flows from the MS to the MSC, VLR, and HLR, with acknowledgments sent back to the MS.
   - **Interaction Checks**: Not required.
   - **Notification**: The network sends an indication of acceptance or rejection of the erasure request to the served mobile station.

3. **Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy)**:
   - **Rules**: The same rules apply as for CFU, but no checks for interaction with other supplementary services are required.
   - **Process Flow**: The erasure request follows the same path from the MS to the MSC, VLR, and HLR, with acknowledgments sent back to the MS.
   - **Interaction Checks**: Not required.
   - **Notification**: The network sends an indication of acceptance or rejection of the erasure request to the served mobile station.

4. **Call Forwarding on Mobile Subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc)**:
   - **Rules**: The same rules apply as for CFU, but no checks for interaction with other supplementary services are required.
   - **Process Flow**: The erasure request follows the same path from the MS to the MSC, VLR, and HLR, with acknowledgments sent back to the MS.
   - **Interaction Checks**: Not required.
   - **Notification**: The network sends an indication of acceptance or rejection of the erasure request to the served mobile station.

In summary, while the general process for erasing call forwarding services involves the MS, MSC, VLR, and HLR, CFU requires interaction checks with other supplementary services, whereas CFB, CFNRy, and CFNRc do not. Notifications are sent to the subscriber upon erasure of the service.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The general rules for erasing call forwarding services, highlighting the specific rules for CFU, CFB, CFNRy, and CFNRc.

   - **Applicability**: This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic and is applicable to both EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD.

2. **RACH Access Delay Measurement**:
   - **Purpose**: This measurement provides the distribution of the time before UEs in a cell achieve a successful attach. The RACH access delay is the time from when a UE sends its first Random Access Preamble until the UE receives the Random Access Response.
   - **How it is obtained**: The measurement is obtained by incrementing the measurement bin corresponding to the access delay experienced by the UE. The access delay is calculated based on the values of the IEs numberOfPreamblesSent and contentionDetected reported by the UE inside the UEInformationResponse message. The measurement is incremented each time a UEInformationResponse message containing the rach-Report-r9 IE is received.
   - **Format**: Each measurement is an integer value, represented as RRU.RachAccessDelayDist.BinX, where BinX represents the bin. The number of bins and the range for each bin is left to implementation.

Describe the process and requirements for verifying the Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) of a repeater as specified in 3GPP TS 25.153.,"The Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is defined as the ratio of the RRC weighted gain per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the repeater on an adjacent channel. The carrier in the pass band and in the adjacent channel must be of the same type, referred to as the reference carrier. This requirement applies to both the uplink and downlink of the repeater at maximum gain, where the donor link is maintained via antennas, also known as an over-the-air repeater.

To verify that the repeater meets the ACRR requirement, the following steps should be followed:

1. Set up the equipment as shown in annex A of the specification.

Describe the RTSP parameters and headers defined in the 3gpp_rtsp application according to TS 26.237 Annex A.,"The 3gpp_rtsp application defines a set of RTSP parameters that are included in the 'a=fmtp' line of the SDP. These parameters are expressed in the form of parameter=value. For example, the 'version' parameter sets the 'version-number' representing the version of RTSP that will be used in the RTSP media stream. In this version of the specification, the version number shall be '1.0'. This RTSP version must be included in all SDP offers and answers, and the same version shall be used by all entities. The format for this parameter is: a=fmtp:3gpp_rtsp version=<version-number>.

To exchange RTSP header fields within the SIP offer/answer, the RTSP media stream allows for attributes with the following format: a=fmtp:3gpp_rtsp h-<header-name>=<header-value>. Here, 'header-name' is the name of the RTSP header field being described, and 'header-value' is the value of the RTSP header field.

Describe the process and key elements involved in modifying a location area monitoring subscription as per 3GPP TS 23.434 specifications.,"The process of modifying a location area monitoring subscription as per 3GPP TS 23.434 involves several key steps and elements:

1. **Initiation by VAL Server**: The VAL server initiates the location area monitoring subscription modify request. This request is sent to the location management server and includes specific information as outlined in Table 9.3.2.17-1. This information typically includes details about the subscription that needs to be modified, such as the list of UEs (User Equipment) moving in or out of a specific location area.

2. **Authorization Check by Location Management Server**: Upon receiving the request, the location management server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the subscription modification. This step ensures that only authorized servers can modify subscriptions, maintaining the integrity and security of the location monitoring system.

3. **Response from Location Management Server**: After verifying the authorization, the location management server replies with a location area monitoring subscription modify response. This response includes the subscription status and other relevant information as specified in Table 9.3.2.18-1. The response indicates whether the subscription modification was successful or if there were any issues.

4. **High-Level Procedure**: The high-level procedure for the subscription modify request is illustrated in Figure 9.3.12.2-1. This figure outlines the interaction between the VAL server and the location management server, detailing the steps involved in the request and response process. The procedure can be applied to other SEAL servers and location management clients that need to modify their subscriptions.

5. **API Operation**: The API operation for updating the location area monitoring subscription is named Update_Location_Area_Monitoring_Subscribe. This operation is used by the VAL server to update the subscription. The inputs required for this API operation are specified in subclause 9.3.2.17, and the outputs are specified in subclause 9.3.2.18. Detailed usage of this API operation is described in subclause 9.3.12.2.

"Describe the direct link rekeying procedure for a UE, including the conditions under which it is initiated, the messages involved, and the handling of these messages by different types of UEs.","The direct link rekeying procedure for a User Equipment (UE) is initiated under specific conditions to refresh the session key (KD-sess) used for direct link communication. The procedure is initiated by a UE in the following cases: (a) the session key KD-sess is about to expire and needs to be refreshed, and neither timer T4111 nor T4112 are running; or (b) the UE wants to refresh KD and neither timer T4111 nor T4112 are running.

The initiating UE generates a new 128-bit Nonce_1 value and the most significant 8-bits of the KD-sess ID. It then creates a DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message, which includes:
- Nonce_1 IE set to the nonce value provided by the initiating UE for session key establishment,
- UE Security Capabilities IE indicating the list of supported algorithms for security establishment,
- MSB of KD-sess ID IE set to the most significant 8-bits of the KD-sess ID,
- Optionally, an Auth Flag IE indicating the KD to be refreshed, if the UE wants to refresh KD,
- Optionally, a PRUK ID IE if the initiating UE is a remote UE towards a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE.

The initiating UE sends the DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message to the target UE and starts timer T4112.

If the initiating UE is a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, it may trigger the remote UE to initiate its own direct link rekeying procedure by sending a DIRECT_REKEYING_TRIGGER message and starting timer T4113. Upon receiving this message, the remote UE will initiate the direct link rekeying procedure if timer T4112 is not running, or discard the message if timer T4112 is running.

A remote UE that receives a DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message will ignore it if timer T4112 is running. If there is no timer T4112 running but the remote UE wants to refresh KD, it will ignore the received DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message and act as the new initiating UE, starting its own direct link rekeying procedure.

Other UEs will ignore a DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message if timer T4112 is running and the Nonce_1 value received is not larger than the locally generated Nonce_1 value included in the last DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message sent by the target UE.

The timers involved in this procedure (T4111, T4112, T4113) play a crucial role in managing the timing and sequence of the rekeying process, ensuring that the session key is refreshed appropriately and avoiding conflicts or redundant rekeying attempts.","The answer should include the conditions under which a UE initiates the direct link rekeying procedure, the format and contents of the DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message, the role of the ProSe UE-to-network relay UE in triggering the procedure, and the handling of the DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message by remote UE and other UEs. It should also cover the specific timers involved (T4111, T4112, T4113) and their significance in the procedure."
Describe the roaming support for MPS (Mission Critical Services) in both home country and outside home country as per 3GPP specifications.,"The roaming support for Mission Critical Services (MPS) is outlined in the 3GPP specifications with specific conditions for both within the home country and outside the home country.

When a User Equipment (UE) with an MPS subscription is roaming within the home country, the system shall support MPS provided that both the visited and home networks support MPS and roaming agreements are in place for MPS. This support is subject to national/regional rules and operator policy. The subscription-related information stored in the UE is used for roaming within the home country. For EUTRAN access to the EPC, membership in a special access class is used, and for 5G (NR and E-UTRAN access to the 5GC), membership in Access Identity 1 is utilized.

When a UE with an MPS subscription is roaming outside the home country, the system shall support MPS under similar conditions: both the visited and home networks must support MPS, and roaming agreements must be in place. This support is also subject to national/regional rules and operator policy. The UE subscription in the home PLMN is configured for MPS with the visited PLMN outside the home country. The home PLMN can configure the UE to discover and select a network supporting MPS when roaming outside the home country, which may involve selecting a specific MPS-capable visited PLMN in countries with multiple PLMNs where some are MPS capable and others are not.

Access Identities play a crucial role in MPS configuration. Any number of these Access Identities may be barred at any one time, which is relevant for managing MPS access.

In summary, MPS support during roaming is contingent on network capabilities, roaming agreements, and specific configurations of the UE subscription, with considerations for national/regional rules and operator policies.","The answer should include the conditions under which MPS is supported when roaming within the home country and outside the home country, including the necessary roaming agreements and network support. It should also cover the role of Access Identities in MPS configuration, and the ability of the home PLMN to configure the UE for network selection when roaming outside the home country."
Explain the synchronization process and timing accuracy requirements for V2X sidelink communication using GNSS as described in 3GPP documents.,"The synchronization process for V2X sidelink communication using GNSS involves deriving the DFN (Data Frame Number) and SubframeNumber from the current UTC time obtained from GNSS. The formulae used are:

DFN = FLOOR(0.1 * (Tcurrent - Tref - offsetDFN)) mod 1024
SubframeNumber = FLOOR(Tcurrent - Tref - offsetDFN) mod 10

Where:
- Tcurrent is the current UTC time obtained from GNSS, expressed in milliseconds.
- Tref is the reference UTC time set at 00:00:00 on January 1, 1900, expressed in milliseconds.
- OffsetDFN is a configurable value, otherwise it is zero, expressed in milliseconds.

In case of a leap second change event, the V2X UE must adjust Tcurrent accordingly, and handling the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to UE implementation.

For timing accuracy requirements, the UE is tested for V2V sidelink communication using GNSS synchronization. The test setup involves the UE being triggered by the test loop function to transmit for V2V communication, with the test system emulating and sending GNSS signals to the UE. The transmit timing accuracy is verified by the UE transmitting PSSCH (Physical Sidelink Shared Channel) and PSCCH (Physical Sidelink Control Channel).

The UE is required to derive reference timing from GNSS signals, and the sidelink transmissions must occur before the subframe starting boundary derived from the synchronization process. The transmission timing error for sidelink transmissions must be less than or equal to Te, where Te is specified as 12*Ts, with Ts being the basic timing unit defined in 3GPP TS 36.211.

The normative reference for these requirements is 3GPP TS 36.133, clause 12.2 and A.11.1.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how DFN and SubframeNumber are derived using GNSS synchronization, including the formulae and definitions of Tcurrent, Tref, and OffsetDFN.

"Describe the interworking system architecture between MBS and eMBMS at the service layer, including the key functionalities and reference points involved.","The interworking system architecture between Multicast-Broadcast Services (MBS) and evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) at the service layer is designed to enable the provision of the same multicast/broadcast service via both MBS and eMBMS. This architecture is depicted in Figure 5.2-1 of TS 23.247 and Figure 4.9-1 of TS 26.502.

Key functionalities and reference points involved in this interworking system architecture include:

1. **Common Reference Points**: The BM-SC+MBSF/MBSTF exposes common reference points such as Nmb5/Nmb10/xMB-C/MB2-C and Nmb8/xMB-U/MB2-U to the Network Exposure Function (NEF) and/or Application Function/Application Server (AF/AS). These reference points facilitate communication and data transfer between the MBS and eMBMS systems.

2. **Common TMGI Usage**: A common Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI) is used towards the AF/AS and serves as an identifier for transport over E-UTRAN/EPC. This ensures that the same service can be identified and accessed via both MBS and eMBMS.

3. **Data Distribution**: The MBSTF distributes the received data to the MB-UPF at reference point Nmb9 and/or the MBMS-GW at reference point SGi-mb, depending on the operator network configuration. This allows for efficient data distribution across both systems.

4. **Provisioning of User Services**: MBS User Services are provisioned in the MBSF via reference point Nmb10, while eMBMS User Services are separately provisioned in the MBSF at reference point xMB-C or MB2-C. Both services use a common TMGI and should ingest the same content to ensure service continuity between the MBS and eMBMS systems.

5. **Signaling to MBS Client**: Signaling from the MBSF to the MBS Client is included in the MBS User Service Announcement, indicating that the equivalent User Service is also available via eMBMS. This allows a User Equipment (UE) that implements both an MBS Client and an eMBMS Client to choose the service from either network and dynamically switch between them based on reception conditions.

6. **Content Ingestion**: Content for the provisioned MBS User Service is ingested by the MBTSF at reference point Nmb8, while content for the provisioned eMBMS User Service is ingested by the MBSTF at reference point xMB-U or MB-2. If these reference points are compatible, the content can be ingested once to satisfy both logical ingests.

7. **Compatibility of Distribution Methods**: MBS User Services distribution methods are compatible with eMBMS delivery methods, allowing the same ingested content to be delivered to both MBS Clients and eMBMS Clients. This architecture also supports UEs that only support eMBMS.

Overall, the interworking system architecture between MBS and eMBMS at the service layer ensures seamless provision and continuity of multicast/broadcast services across both systems, leveraging common reference points, TMGI usage, and compatible distribution methods.","The answer should include a description of the interworking system architecture between MBS and eMBMS at the service layer, highlighting the common reference points (Nmb5/Nmb10/xMB-C/MB2-C and Nmb8/xMB-U/MB2-U) and the use of a common TMGI. It should explain the distribution of data to MB-UPF and MBMS-GW, the provisioning of user services in the MBSF, signaling to the MBS Client, content ingestion by MBTSF and MBSTF, and the compatibility of distribution methods with eMBMS delivery."
"Describe the process and conditions under which a UE initiates a trace recording session in a 3GPP network, including the role of triggering events and the subsequent actions taken by the UE and IMS NE.","The process of initiating a trace recording session at a User Equipment (UE) in a 3GPP network begins with the activation of a trace session. This involves establishing a management session in accordance with OMA Device Management protocols, during which the UE receives Trace Session Activation and stores the Trace Control and configuration parameters. Depending on operator conditions, the UE may start a trace session.

A trace recording session is initiated when the UE detects any of the defined triggering events and the conditions specified by the trace control and configuration parameters are met. For originating UEs, this includes the initiation of the specified service to be traced, which can be triggered by either the end user or an application. For terminating UEs, triggering events include the initiation of the specified service and the reception of an incoming SIP message containing the service level tracing Start Triggering Event.

Upon detecting a triggering event, the UE includes a service level tracing Start Triggering Event in the appropriate outgoing SIP signalling message. This ensures that the trace recording session captures relevant information related to the service being traced.

In the IMS network, Network Elements (NE) with active trace sessions also start trace recording sessions upon detecting a service level tracing Start Triggering Event. These NEs provide indications in the generated charging information that service level tracing has been applied. Charging for Service Level Tracing in IMS is managed using IMS charging mechanisms, and it is possible to apply specific tariffs, such as zero rating, to the bearer and/or signalling traffic associated with the traced services.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The initial steps for activating a trace session at a UE, including the establishment of a management session and storage of configuration parameters.
  - The conditions under which a trace recording session is initiated, including the detection of triggering events.
  - The specific triggering events for both originating and terminating UEs.
  - The inclusion of Start Triggering Events in outgoing SIP messages.
  - The role of IMS NE in starting trace recording sessions and providing indications in charging information.
  - The charging mechanisms for Service Level Tracing in IMS and the possibility of applying specific tariffs."
"Describe the directed retry handover procedure in the context of both intra-3G_MSC and inter-3G_MSC scenarios, including the steps involved and the actions taken in case of failure.","The directed retry handover procedure is designed to allow the network to select the optimum cell for the User Equipment (UE) or Mobile Station (MS). This process involves assigning the UE/MS to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell, which can be triggered by various assignment procedures.

For intra-3G_MSC scenarios, the directed retry procedure begins with the assignment phase, where an Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message is sent. If a UMTS to GSM handover is necessary due to radio conditions, congestion, or network preference, the UE/MS may be handed over to a GSM cell. The RNS-A sends an Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message indicating 'Directed Retry' and subsequently an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message. Upon receipt of this message, 3G_MSC-A initiates the UMTS to GSM handover. If the handover is successful, the resources on RNS-A are cleared after receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B. In case of failure, such as receiving an Iu-RELOCATION FAILURE or A-HANDOVER-FAILURE, 3G_MSC-A may send an Iu-RELOCATION-PREPARATION FAILURE, retry the assignment procedure, or clear the complete call.

For inter-3G_MSC scenarios, the procedure involves a subsequent channel assignment requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A after an Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or SRNS relocation without circuit connection. If RNS-A replies with an Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE containing the cause value 'Directed Retry' and the subsequent Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED indicates a directed retry handover, 3G_MSC-B waits for the outcome of the directed retry handover procedure. If successful, 3G_MSC-B constructs an A-ASSIGNMENT-COMPLETE or Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message and forwards it to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A. If unsuccessful, 3G_MSC-B may send an Iu-RELOCATION-PREPARATION FAILURE, retry the assignment procedure, or send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE or Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message indicating failure.

In summary, the directed retry handover procedure involves specific steps and message exchanges to ensure optimal cell selection for the UE/MS. The actions taken in case of failure include retrying the assignment procedure, sending failure messages, or clearing the call, with differences in handling intra-3G_MSC and inter-3G_MSC scenarios.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The purpose of the directed retry procedure and how it allows the network to select the optimum cell for the UE/MS.
  - The steps involved in the directed retry handover procedure for both intra-3G_MSC and inter-3G_MSC scenarios.
  - The specific messages exchanged during the procedure, such as Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST, Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE, and Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED.

Describe the minimum performance requirements and testing criteria for FR1 and FR2 MIMO OTA as specified in 3GPP TS 38.151.,"The minimum performance requirements and testing criteria for FR1 and FR2 MIMO OTA as specified in 3GPP TS 38.151 are as follows:

For FR1 MIMO OTA:
1. **Average TRMS Definition**: The average TRMS (Total Radiated Multi-path Sensitivity) for free space data mode portrait (FS DMP), free space data mode landscape (FS DML), and free space data mode screen up (FS DMSU) is defined as the FR1 MIMO OTA requirement. The averaging is done in linear scale for the TRMS results at these Device Under Test (DUT) positions.
2. **Formula for Averaging TRMS**: The TRMS is calculated using the measured sensitivity values at each azimuth position at the 70% throughput outage. If one azimuth position does not result in a defined measured sensitivity at 70% throughput, the missing result is substituted using the maximum downlink RS-EPRE (PRS-EPRE-MAX) supported by the test system, defined as -80dBm/15kHz (or equivalent -77dBm/30kHz) for FR1 MIMO OTA.
3. **Criteria for Azimuthal Orientations**: The Equipment Under Test (EUT) must meet 70% throughput in 11 of the total 12 azimuthal orientations. If the EUT fails to meet this criterion even under maximum downlink power condition (PRS-EPRE-MAX), it fails the FR1 MIMO OTA test. Additionally, the EUT must meet 90% throughput in 10 of the total 12 azimuthal orientations under the same conditions.
4. **Minimum Performance Requirements**: The FR1 TRMS minimum performance requirements for NR handheld UEs operating on SA mode in free space and the primary mechanical mode are specified in Table 6.2-1.

For FR2 MIMO OTA:
1. **MIMO Average Spherical Coverage (MASC) Definition**: The MIMO Average Spherical Coverage (MASC) is the Figure of Merit for FR2 MIMO OTA requirement. It is measured with 36 constant-density points within the 3D sphere, and the MASC is determined by averaging the best 18 sensitivity values for power class 3 UE.
2. **Formula for Averaging MASC**: The averaging is done in linear scale for the MASC result using the best 18 sensitivity values from all the 36 constant density measurement points.
3. **Criteria for Test Points**: The MASC is measured at the mid channel, and the maximum downlink RS-EPRE supported by the test system for FR2 MIMO OTA is defined as -79.1dBm/120kHz. If the number of test points where the UE can meet 70% maximum throughput outage even under maximum downlink power condition is less than 18, the UE fails the test.
4. **Minimum Performance Requirements**: The FR2 MASC minimum performance requirements for power class 3 NR handheld UEs in free space and the primary mechanical mode are specified in Table 7.2-1.

These criteria ensure that the devices meet the necessary performance standards for effective operation in their respective modes and environments.","The answer must include the definitions and formulas for TRMS and MASC, the specific criteria for azimuthal orientations and test points, the conditions under which the EUT or UE fails the FR1 and FR2 MIMO OTA tests, and the references to the relevant tables (Table 6.2-1 and Table 7.2-1) for minimum performance requirements."
Describe the block encoding process for SACCH as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003.,"The block encoding process for SACCH as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003 involves several steps to ensure error correction and detection. Firstly, a block of 184 information bits is protected by adding 40 extra bits, known as parity bits. These parity bits are generated using a shortened binary cyclic code (FIRE code) with the generator polynomial g(D) = (D23 + 1)*(D17 + D3 + 1). The encoding of this cyclic code is performed systematically, meaning that the polynomial formed by the information bits and parity bits, when divided by the generator polynomial, yields a remainder equal to 1 + D + D2 +...+ D39. 

Additionally, four tail bits, all set to 0, are appended to the information and parity bits, resulting in a final block of 228 bits. Specifically, the information bits are denoted as u(k) = d(k) for k = 0,1,...,183, the parity bits are u(k) = p(k-184) for k = 184,185,...,223, and the tail bits are u(k) = 0 for k = 224,225,226,227.

The encoding process for SACCH follows these specifications as outlined in subclause 4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 45.003, ensuring consistency and reliability in the encoding method.","The answer should include the process of adding parity bits to the 184 information bits using the shortened binary cyclic code (FIRE code) with the specified generator polynomial.

"What are the requirements for L1-SINR measurements in FR2 as specified in TS 38.533, and how do they relate to the conditions defined in TS 38.101?","The requirements for L1-SINR measurements in FR2 as specified in TS 38.533 include several key aspects related to the UE's capability, resource mapping, periodicity, measurement periods, and accuracy conditions. 

Firstly, the UE must be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements using CSI-RS resources configured as Channel Measurement Resource (CMR) and dedicated resources configured as Interference Measurement Resource (IMR). These resources must be mapped 1-to-1 with the same periodicity for accurate measurements. The measurement period, TL1-SINR_Measurement_Period_CSI-RS_CMR_IMR, is defined in Table 7.7.6.0.3-2 for FR2.

The value of M is determined based on the configuration of the CSI-RS and IMR resources:
- M=1 is applied for aperiodic resources or periodic/semi-persistent resources with specific higher layer parameters configured.
- M=3 is applied otherwise.

The value of N varies depending on the periodicity and repetition settings of the CSI-RS resources:
- For periodic resources with repetition set to OFF, N=1.
- For periodic resources with repetition set to ON, N=ceil(maxNumberRxBeam / Nres_per_set).
- Similar rules apply for semi-persistent and aperiodic resources.

P is defined as the maximum value between PCMR and PIMR, derived similarly to the value of P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement.

Accuracy requirements are valid under specific conditions:
- Reference sensitivity conditions defined in TS 38.101-2 clause 7.3.
- L1-SINR measurement conditions according to Annex B.2.8.3 for each relevant band.
- Bandwidth and density specifications for CSI-RS, NZP-IMR, and ZP-IMR.
- Measured signals must be within the percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE as defined in TS 38.101-2 clause 7.3.4.
- AWGN radio propagation conditions.
- CSI-RS based CMR and IMR must come from the same direction.

Performance expectations with larger bandwidth are equal to or better than the specified accuracy requirements. Normative references for these requirements are found in TS 38.133 clauses 9.8.4.3 and 10.1.28.3.

Describe the requirements and test parameters for E-UTRAN TDD intra-frequency RSTD measurement reporting delay.,"The requirements for E-UTRAN TDD intra-frequency RSTD measurement reporting delay specify that the User Equipment (UE) must be able to detect and measure intra-frequency Reference Signal Time Difference (RSTD) for at least 16 cells, including the reference cell, within a specified time. This time is calculated based on the cell-specific positioning subframe configuration period, the number of Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) positioning occasions, and the measurement time for a single PRS positioning occasion. The UE must report RSTD for the reference cell and all neighbor cells within the given conditions, including signal strength thresholds of -6 dB for the reference cell and -13 dB for neighbor cells.

"Describe the process of generating and mapping PDSCH transmissions for NR-SAN-FR1-TMs, including the initialization of the PN sequence generator, user-specific scrambling, modulation, and resource allocation.","The process of generating and mapping PDSCH transmissions for NR-SAN-FR1-TMs involves several steps:

1. **Initialization of the PN Sequence Generator**: The PN23 sequence generator is initialized with a starting seed of 'all ones' in the first allocated slot of each frame. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries, ensuring a seamless transition between slots. For transmission modes (TMs) with multiple users, the PN sequence can be generated per user, identified by nRNTI.

2. **User-Specific Scrambling**: Perform user-specific scrambling according to the guidelines provided in TS 38.211, clause 7.3.1.1. This step ensures that the data for each user is uniquely scrambled, preventing interference between users.

3. **Modulation**: The scrambled bits are then modulated using the modulation scheme defined for each user, as specified in TS 38.211, clause 7.3.1.1. This step converts the scrambled bits into complex-valued modulation symbols.

4. **Mapping of Complex-Valued Symbols to Layers**: The complex-valued modulation symbols for each codeword are mapped onto the layers according to TS 38.211, clause 7.3.1.3. The number of layers is determined by the specific configuration of the transmission.

5. **PDSCH Mapping**: Perform PDSCH mapping according to TS 38.211, using the parameters listed in table 4.9.2.2-2. This step involves assigning the modulated symbols to the appropriate physical resource blocks (PRBs) for transmission.

6. **PDSCH Resource Allocation**: The resource allocation for PDSCH is done according to TS 38.214. The allocation types vary based on the specific NR-SAN-FR1-TM:
   - NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1, NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1: Type 1 for PDSCH with nRNTI = 0 and nRNTI = 2.
   - NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.2, NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2, NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.3: Type 0 for PDSCH with nRNTI = 0 and nRNTI = 1, Type 1 for PDSCH with nRNTI = 2.
   - NR-SAN-FR1-TM2: Type 1 for PDSCH with nRNTI = 2.

"Describe the structure and purpose of the client credentials assertion headers in 3GPP TS 29.500, including the encoding and key claims.","The client credentials assertion headers in 3GPP TS 29.500 are designed to facilitate the authorization of NF service consumers for data access. These headers are included in service requests sent from an NF Service Consumer (e.g., DCCF) to an NF Service Producer (e.g., AMF, SMF). The structure of these headers follows the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) encoding as defined in IETF RFC 7230.

The headers contain a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) as specified in IETF RFC 7515. The JWT includes several key claims, such as 'sub' (subject), 'iat' (issued at), 'exp' (expiration), and 'aud' (audience). These claims are encoded as a JSON object and must comply with the OpenAPI definition provided in the specification.

Additionally, the JWT must include one of the following JOSE headers for signing the client authentication assertion:
- The X.509 URL (x5u) header, which refers to a resource for the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain used for signing.
- The X.509 Certificate Chain (x5c) header, which includes the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain used for signing.

Describe the procedures used by the BTS for channel activation and management during voice group calls as specified in 3GPP TS 48.058.,"The procedures used by the BTS for channel activation and management during voice group calls as specified in 3GPP TS 48.058 involve several steps and messages. Initially, the procedure is used to activate a channel at the BTS for a Mobile Station (MS), which will later be commanded to this channel by various command messages such as IMMediate ASSIGN, ASSIGN CoMmanD, ADDitional ASSIGNment, NOTIFICATION, CHANNEL RELEASE (with a Channel description), HANDOver CoMmanD, or CONFiguration CHange CoMmanD message. In the case of handover, the procedure is used between the target Base Station Controller (BSC) and the target BTS to activate a channel for a subsequent handover from the old BTS.

During the period the channel is activated for a voice group call, the BTS uses specific procedures to manage the call. Upon detection of an MS on a channel activated for group call, the BTS builds the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018, sends the message to the MS in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link, and starts timer T3115. A TALKER DETection message is sent to the BSC, which contains the measured delay of the access burst. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS, the BTS repeats the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the MS. If the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message has been repeated Ny2 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from the MS, the BTS sends a CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message to the BSC with the cause value ","The answer should cover the activation of channels at the BTS for MS, the specific command messages involved, the role of BTS during voice group calls, the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message, timer T3115, TALKER DETection message, CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message, and LISTENER DETection message.

Explain the ACS information configuration and discovery procedures in 5G networks as described in 3GPP TS 23.316 and TS 23.502.,"The ACS (Auto Configuration Server) information configuration and discovery procedures in 5G networks involve several steps and methods as described in 3GPP TS 23.316 and TS 23.502.

Firstly, the ACS information configuration procedure enables a 3rd party Application Function (AF) to configure ACS information, such as a URL or IP address, to the 5G Core (5GC). This procedure involves the following steps:
1. The 3rd party AF provides the ACS information in the Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update Request to the Network Exposure Function (NEF).
2. The NEF provisions the ACS information to the Unified Data Management (UDM) and User Data Repository (UDR).
3. The UDM/UDR updates the Session Management Function (SMF) with the ACS information.
4. The SMF uses this information to provide ACS information to the Residential Gateway (RG) during the DHCP process or PDU session establishment.

The ACS information may be associated with the RG subscription in the UDM/UDR and can be provided to the RG using one of the following methods:
- Via DHCP interaction: If the RG sends DHCP signaling indicating a request for ACS information, it receives ACS information from the DHCP server. This process is specified in BBF TR-069 and BBF TR-369.
- During the PDU session establishment procedure via Protocol Configuration Option (PCO): If the 5G-RG requests ACS information via PCO, the SMF provides it during the PDU session establishment.

The priority order for ACS information received by the 5G-RG is as follows:
1. ACS information received during the DHCP process.
2. ACS information received during the PDU session establishment procedure from SMF PCO.
3. Pre-configured ACS information in the RG.

If the RG performs ACS discovery via the DHCP process and the SMF is not the DHCP server, the ACS URL is provided by an external DHCP server, making the process transparent to the 5GC. If the SMF is the DHCP server, it provides ACS information as part of the DHCP process, supporting the procedures defined in BBF TR-069 and BBF TR-369.

In summary, the ACS information configuration and discovery procedures in 5G networks involve interactions between the 3rd party AF, NEF, UDM/UDR, SMF, and RG, with specific methods and priority orders for providing ACS information to ensure seamless network configuration and management.","The answer must include a detailed explanation of the ACS information configuration procedure involving the 3rd party AF and the steps outlined in TS 23.502 figure 4.15.6.2-1. It should also cover the methods of providing ACS information to RG, including DHCP interaction and PDU session establishment via PCO, and the priority order for ACS information. Additionally, the role of SMF and external DHCP server in the ACS discovery process should be explained."
"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the controlling MCVideo function releases the MCVideo session, including the interaction with the media plane and the generation of SIP messages.","The controlling MCVideo function releases the MCVideo session under various conditions and follows specific procedures to ensure proper interaction with the media plane and generation of SIP messages. 

1. **Interaction with the Media Plane**: Upon receiving a SIP BYE request or a SIP 200 (OK) response to a SIP BYE request, the controlling MCVideo function interacts with the media plane to release the media plane resources associated with the SIP session. This interaction is specified in clause 6.3 of TS 24.581.

2. **Generation and Sending of SIP Messages**: 
   - **SIP BYE Request**: When a participant needs to be removed from the MCVideo session, the controlling MCVideo function generates a SIP BYE request and sends it to the MCVideo clients. This procedure is detailed in TS 24.229.

   - **SIP NOTIFY Request**: If the MCVideo session is not required to be released, the controlling MCVideo function sends a SIP NOTIFY request to all remaining MCVideo clients in the session who have subscribed to the conference event package.

3. **Conditions for Session Release**:
   - **Private Call**: The session is released if the T4 (Inactivity) timer expires, the session has lasted longer than the maximum duration of a private call, or there are only one or no participants in the session.
   - **Pre-arranged Group Call**: The session is released if the T4 (Inactivity) timer expires, there are only one or no participants, the initiator of the group call leaves the session according to local policy, the minimum number of affiliated group members is not present, or the TNG3 (group call timer) expires.

4. **Specific Procedures**:
   - **Private Calls**: The controlling MCVideo function releases the session based on the conditions mentioned above.
   - **Pre-arranged Group Calls**: The session is released following the specific conditions and procedures outlined, including handling the TNG3 timer.

5. **Conference State Event Notifications**: When sending a conference state event notification, the controlling MCVideo function generates a notification package and sends a SIP NOTIFY request to all participants who have subscribed to the conference state event package.

These procedures ensure that the MCVideo session is managed effectively, with proper interaction with the media plane and adherence to SIP messaging protocols.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the call flows for Policy and Charging Control (PCC) in 5G systems, including both standard PCC and PCC with support for multicast-broadcast services.","In 5G systems, Policy and Charging Control (PCC) call flows are essential for managing network policies and charging mechanisms. The call flows can be categorized into two main types: standard PCC and PCC with support for multicast-broadcast services.

Standard PCC call flows, which do not support 5G multicast-broadcast services, are detailed in clauses 5.1 to 5.6. These call flows involve various service-based interfaces, including Npcf (Policy Control Function), Nsmf (Session Management Function), Namf (Access and Mobility Management Function), Nudr (Unified Data Repository), Nnef (Network Exposure Function), Nchf (Charging Function), Nbsf (Binding Support Function), and Nnwdaf (Network Data Analytics Function). Each interface plays a specific role in the signaling and control processes within the 5G system, ensuring efficient policy enforcement and charging operations.

For PCC with support for 5G multicast-broadcast services, the call flows are specified in clause 5.7.

Describe the timing advance mechanism and timeslot length options in GSM networks as specified in 3GPP TS 45.010.,"The timing advance mechanism in GSM networks is crucial for synchronizing mobile station (MS) transmissions with the base transceiver station (BTS). The maximum timing advance value (TAmax) varies depending on the GSM band. For standard GSM bands, TAmax is 63, while for GSM 400, it is 219. If the BTS measures a timing advance value larger than TAmax, it sets the timing advance to the maximum value (63 or 219, respectively).

The timing advance is calculated in terms of the number of symbols with a normal symbol period, regardless of the actual symbol period used on the uplink. The timing advance values range from 0 to TAmax, where 0 corresponds to no timing advance, meaning MS transmissions are 468.75 symbol periods behind the BTS transmissions. The value TAmax corresponds to the maximum timing advance, meaning MS transmissions are 468.75 - TAmax symbol periods behind.

Regarding timeslot length options, the BTS may optionally use a timeslot length of 157 normal symbol periods on timeslots with TN = 0 and 4, and 156 normal symbol periods on timeslots with TN = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, instead of the standard 156.25 normal symbol periods on all timeslots. This implementation option is further elaborated in subclause 5.7.2, which describes the use of reduced symbol periods. In this option, the timeslot length for bursts with reduced symbol periods is 188.4 reduced symbol periods for TN = 0 and 4, and 187.2 reduced symbol periods for TN = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The different burst lengths are achieved by adjusting the guard period lengths between adjacent timeslots.

For MS transmissions, the timing requirements include a tolerance of ±1 normal symbol period, or ±½ normal symbol period for CTS. When responding to RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Requests or Observed Time Difference messages, the tolerance is ±1/8 normal symbol period or better. The MS must calculate and report the transmission offset when performing Multilateration Timing Advance procedures.

In multislot configurations, the MS uses a common timebase for all channels. If the MS does not support reduced symbol period bursts, it may use the optional timeslot length of 157 normal symbol periods for TN = 0 and 4, and 156 normal symbol periods for other timeslots. An EC-GSM-IoT MS in EC operation must use timeslot lengths with integer symbol periods. If the MS supports reduced symbol period transmissions, it uses a timeslot length of 187.5 reduced symbol periods or 156.25 normal symbol periods. The guard period between different symbol period bursts on adjacent timeslots is 8.5 normal symbol periods, equivalent to 10.2 reduced symbol periods.

In circuit-switched multislot configurations, the common timebase is derived from the main channel, and TA values from other channels are neglected. In packet-switched configurations, the common timebase is derived from all monitored timeslots. For combined circuit and packet-switched configurations, the common timebase may be derived from the circuit-switched channel only.","The answer should include the maximum timing advance values for GSM 400 and other GSM bands, the handling of timing advance values exceeding TAmax, the optional timeslot length configurations for normal and reduced symbol periods, the guard period lengths for different timeslot configurations, the range of timing advance values and their impact on MS transmissions, and the detailed timing requirements for MS transmissions including tolerances and handling of timing advance in multislot configurations."
How does the VAL server subscribe to unicast QoS monitoring and obtain the monitoring data from the NRM server?,"To subscribe to unicast QoS monitoring, the VAL server initiates the process by sending an HTTP POST request to the NRM server targeting the URI of the 'Unicast Monitoring Subscriptions' resource. The request body must include the MonitoringSubscription data structure, specifying whether immediate reporting and/or one-time reporting is requested. This is indicated by setting the 'immRep' attribute to 'true' for immediate reporting, and the 'reportingMode' attribute to 'ONE_TIME' along with 'immRep' set to 'true' for one-time reporting.

Upon receiving the HTTP POST request, the NRM server verifies the identity and authorization of the VAL server. If the VAL server is not authorized, the NRM server responds with an appropriate error status code. If authorized, the NRM server determines whether the requested data is available internally or needs to be retrieved from the NEF using the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure API. For immediate and one-time reporting, the NRM server checks the availability of the requested data and interacts with the NEF if necessary.

Once the data is retrieved or the subscription is established, the NRM server responds to the VAL server. For immediate and one-time reporting, an HTTP '200 OK' status code is returned with the MonitoringReport data structure containing the requested unicast QoS monitoring data. Otherwise, the NRM server creates a new 'Individual Unicast Monitoring Subscription' resource and responds with an HTTP '201 Created' status code, including the URI for the created resource and the MonitoringSubscription data structure.

The MonitoringReport data structure defines the format and content of the monitoring data. The NRM server also handles notifications for unicast QoS monitoring updates by sending HTTP POST requests to the VAL server's notification URI. The VAL server processes these notifications and responds with a '204 No Content' status code upon success.

Additionally, the VAL server can obtain QoS monitoring data for a specific time period using the Subscribe_Unicast_QoS_Monitoring service operation, which supports immediate and one-time reporting mechanisms.","The answer should include the following key details:
- The initial subscription process where the VAL server sends an HTTP POST request to the NRM server, including the necessary data structures and attributes.
- The verification steps performed by the NRM server to authenticate and authorize the VAL server.
- Interaction with the NEF to retrieve or establish QoS monitoring data.
- The response handling by the NRM server, including the creation of resources and the status codes returned.
- The structure and definition of the MonitoringReport data.
- The notification process for updates, including how the NRM server sends notifications to the VAL server and the response expected from the VAL server.
- The service operation for obtaining QoS monitoring data for a specific time period, including immediate and one-time reporting mechanisms."
"Describe the DNS Query Message Detection Template (MDT) as defined in TS 29.556, including the role of UE IP address and FQDN ranges.","The DNS Query Message Detection Template (MDT) as defined in TS 29.556 includes several key components. A DNS Query MDT may include a User Equipment (UE) IP address and a list of Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) ranges or a wildcard FQDN representing 'any FQDN'. The UE IP address can only be provisioned in a DNS Query MDT and not in a Baseline DNS MDT. However, a DNS rule can reference one or more Baseline DNS Query MDTs along with a UE IP address, in which case the referenced Baseline DNS Query MDTs must be matched for the specific UE IP address.

When a UE IP address is present in a DNS Query MDT or together with a reference to a Baseline DNS Query MDT, it is used to match the DNS Query message with the related DNS rule. If the UE IP address is not present in the DNS Query MDT, the UE IP address provisioned in the DNS context is used instead. FQDNs are matched against the Query Domain Name of DNS Query messages.

The BaselineDnsQueryMdtInfo, as defined in Table 6.1.6.2.20-1, provides the structure and definition for the baseline information used in DNS Query MDTs. This includes the necessary details to ensure proper matching and detection of DNS Query messages based on the specified criteria.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The components of a DNS Query Message Detection Template (MDT).
  - The role and rules for provisioning a UE IP address in DNS Query MDT.

"Describe the handling and routing of SCCP messages in a PLMN that supports mobile number portability, including the roles of MNP-SRF and IN-based solutions for call-related and non-call-related messages.","In a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) that supports mobile number portability, the handling and routing of Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) messages involve several key components and processes. The Mobile Number Portability Signalling Relay Function (MNP-SRF) plays a crucial role in relaying SCCP messages to the Home Location Register (HLR) and may modify the SCCP called party address based on the type of message (call-related, non-call-related, or MNP information request) and the porting status of the called subscriber. Depending on the implemented solution, either IN-based or MNP-SRF-based, the MNP-SRF may route the message to a different HLR, the subscription network, or terminate the dialogue and respond to the Intelligent Network Element (INE).

The IN-based solution is used for call-related messages, which are not routed to the MNP-SRF. This solution allows operators to determine the routing of non-call-related messages in the same database. Non-call-related signalling is handled as described in Normative Annex B, while call-related signalling is detailed in Normative Annex C.

To prevent indefinite looping of messages between PLMNs in a porting domain, the SCCP hop counter is used. The MNP-SRF decrements the SCCP hop counter for every relayed message. This requires the use of non-segmented SCCP XUDT messages as defined in ITU-T 1996 SCCP recommendations or ANSI T1.112-1996 SCCP recommendations for North America.

The handling of SCCP messages also involves the use of SCCP Translation Type values to differentiate between call-related and non-call-related messages. Dedicated Translation Type values for MNP information request messages and call-related messages are used in networks that support these distinctions. The handling of SCCP messages in networks that do not use dedicated Translation Type values for these messages is subject to further study.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of MNP-SRF in relaying SCCP messages to HLR and modifying the SCCP called party address based on the type of message and porting status.
  - The distinction between IN-based and MNP-SRF-based solutions for routing messages.
  - The use of SCCP hop counter to prevent indefinite looping of messages.

"Describe the procedure for indirect data reporting in the context of 3GPP TS 26.532, including the key elements involved in the data report and the necessary configurations and operations.","The procedure for indirect data reporting in the context of 3GPP TS 26.532 involves several key steps and elements. Initially, the Indirect Data Collection Client must be configured according to the procedures specified in clause 4.2.4. Once configured, the client acquires its data collection and configuration from the Data Collection AF.

When the reportCondition of a DataReportingSession is fulfilled, the Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_Report service operation by issuing an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF. The request message body is a DataReport, which is defined in clause 7.3.2.3. The DataReport includes at minimum the baseline information for data reporting as defined in clause 4.6.4 of TS 26.531.

The HTTP POST request must support the URI query parameters specified in table 7.2.3.4.1-1, the request data structures in table 7.2.3.4.1-2, and the request headers in table 7.2.3.4.1-3. The response from the Data Collection AF may include an updated DataReportingSession, which the Indirect Data Collection Client must take note of and act accordingly. The response data structures and response codes are specified in table 7.2.3.4.1-4, and the response headers are specified in table 7.2.3.4.1-5.

Describe the format and usage of URCMP headers and Information Elements as specified in 3GPP TS 29.674.,"The URCMP messages use a fixed length header, which must be a multiple of 4 octets. The general format of the URCMP Header is illustrated in Figure 7.3.2-1. The first octet of the URCMP header includes spare bits (bits 1-5) that should be set to '0' by the sending entity and ignored by the receiving entity. Bits 6 to 8 represent the URCMP version, which should be set to decimal 1 ('001'). Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which is set to a unique value for each type of control plane message as specified in Table 7.3-1. Octets 3 to 5 represent the Message Length field, indicating the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the URCMP header (the first 5 octets). The Sequence Number is included in the length count. Octets 6 to 8 represent the URCMP Sequence Number field.

Information Elements (IEs) have mandatory fields such as Type and Length, and optional fields like Enterprise ID. The Type field indicates the type of the IE, with values within the range of 0 to 32767 reserved for IEs defined by 3GPP, and values within the range of 32768 to 65535 used for vendor-specific IEs. The Length field contains the length of the IE excluding the first four octets. If the IE type value is within the range of 32768 to 65535, the Enterprise ID field contains the IANA-assigned 'SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes' value of the vendor defining the IE. Figures 8.1-1, 8.1-2, and 8.1-3 illustrate the format of IEs defined by 3GPP and vendor-specific IEs.

Grouped Information Elements (IEs) may contain other IEs and have a length value in the TLV encoding, which includes the added length of all embedded IEs. Each IE within a grouped IE also contains a 4 octet long IE header. Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE type values. The clause describing an IE in the specification explicitly states if it is a Grouped IE. If more than one grouped IE of the same type but for different purposes are sent with a message, these IEs shall have different IE types. If more than one grouped IE of the same type and for the same purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have exactly the same IE type to represent a list.","The answer should cover the fixed length and multiple of 4 octets requirement for URCMP headers, the specific usage of bits and fields within the URCMP header, the definition and format of Information Elements including mandatory and optional fields, and the concept and encoding of Grouped Information Elements.

"Describe the process and key considerations for S-CSCF registration and restoration information handling in the IMS architecture, referencing relevant 3GPP specifications.","The S-CSCF (Serving Call Session Control Function) registration process in the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) architecture involves several key steps and considerations, as outlined in various 3GPP specifications.

Firstly, the S-CSCF sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE's (User Equipment) S-CSCF registration to update or create S-CSCF registration information. This request includes the IMS UE's identity, which should be an IMPU (IP Multimedia Public Identity), the S-CSCF Registration Information, and the Registration Type. The S-CSCF checks for the presence of a reg-id parameter in the Contact header of the SIP REGISTER message. If the reg-id parameter exists, it indicates to the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) that the registration is related to multiple registrations.

What are the key elements and requirements for the DL BWP switch delay test for NR RedCap UE as defined in TS 38.533?,"The DL BWP switch delay test for NR RedCap UE as defined in TS 38.533 includes several key elements and requirements:

1. **Test Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to verify the downlink (DL) bandwidth part (BWP) switch delay requirement for RRC-based BWP switch as defined in TS 38.133 clause 8.6A.

2. **Test Applicability**: This test is applicable to all types of NR RedCap UE with 2 RX from Release 17 onwards that support BWP adaptation of at least 2 BWPs.

3. **Minimum Conformance Requirement**: The minimum conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 clause A.16.5.3.2.2.

4. **Test Description**: The test description follows the same guidelines as given in clause 6.5.6.2.1.4, with specific table replacements for the test configurations, initial conditions, and general test parameters.

5. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions are similar to those in clause 6.5.6.2.1.4.1, with exceptions where specific tables are replaced by new ones (Table 16.5.3.2.2.4.1-1, Table 16.5.3.2.2.4.1-2, and Table 16.5.3.2.2.4.1-3).

Describe the call clearing procedures and precondition handling in IMS and SIP-I based circuit-switched core networks as specified in 3GPP TS 29.235 and TS 23.231.,"The call clearing procedures and precondition handling in IMS and SIP-I based circuit-switched core networks are detailed in 3GPP TS 29.235 and TS 23.231. 

According to TS 29.235, if call clearing is initiated from either the succeeding IMS node or the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched core network, the MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function) must apply the call clearing procedures defined in TS 23.231 clause 7.3.1. When a BYE request is sent to the succeeding IMS node without a Reason Header field, the ISUP Cause value received in the encapsulated ISUP REL message must be mapped into SIP Reason header fields as defined by TS 29.163. Similarly, if a final response (4xx, 5xx, or 6xx) to an initial INVITE request is received from the succeeding IMS node without a Reason header, it must be mapped to an ISUP cause value as specified in TS 29.163 table 18, or BYE must be mapped to cause value 16. This cause value must be included in the encapsulated ISUP REL messages. When sending a SIP failure response to an initial INVITE request to the preceding SIP-I node, the cause value in the encapsulated ISUP REL message must be used to determine the SIP failure response code as specified in TS 29.163 table 9.

The MGCF must also map received SIP messages into appropriate SIP messages for the network they are sent to, modify the SDP to include local address information from the IM-MGW and adjust codec information if transcoding is configured, and handle 100 Trying provisional SIP responses by generating them to acknowledge receipt of INVITE requests. If the MGCF defers sending an INVITE request until preconditions are met, it must reply to the INVITE request from the SIP-I based CS CN with a 183 Session Progress provisional response and handle subsequent PRACK and UPDATE requests by replying with a final response. Once preconditions are met, the MGCF forwards the previously received INVITE request with appropriate SDP lines indicating that local preconditions are met. If a 183 Session Progress provisional response is received, the MGCF either acknowledges it with a PRACK request or constructs an ISUP message and includes it in the 183 Session Progress provisional response.

TS 29.235 also describes handling outgoing calls when preconditions are not met. The MGCF defers sending the INVITE request until preconditions are met, selects a codec, and sends back a 183 Progress response. When remote preconditions are met, the MGCF sends the SIP INVITE request to the next IMS node without requesting support for preconditions, includes the selected codec as the first one in the list of offered codecs, and may include the PSTN XML body mapped from previously received ISUP information. The MGCF offers support for early media, confirmed by the IMS node in the 183 Progress response. If a 180 Ringing provisional response is received from the succeeding IMS node, the MGCF orders the IM-MGW to start sending the ringing tone before propagating the 180 Ringing response, which includes the ISUP ACM, to the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched core network.

According to TS 23.231, if a release indication (CANCEL, BYE, final error response) for the initial INVITE request is received from the preceding or succeeding node, and the GMSC server decides to release the call, it must process the request according to SIP procedures for a user agent towards the preceding or succeeding side as specified in IETF RFC 3261, and initiate a call release towards the succeeding or preceding node acting as a user agent. If the GMSC receives a CANCEL request from the preceding node, it must send a 200 OK (CANCEL) response to the preceding node and initiate a CANCEL request to the succeeding node if a final response for the initial INVITE request has not yet been received. If the GMSC server receives a BYE request, it must release seized MGW resources and forward the BYE request to the succeeding/preceding node, then forward the 200 OK(BYE) response received from the succeeding/preceding node. If a final error response (4xx, 5xx, or 6xx) for the initial INVITE request is received from the succeeding node, the GMSC server must release seized MGW resources and forward a final error response to the preceding node.

These procedures ensure proper handling of call clearing and preconditions in IMS and SIP-I based circuit-switched core networks, maintaining seamless communication and resource management.","The answer must include details on the call clearing procedures when initiated from IMS or SIP-I based circuit-switched core network, how ISUP cause values are mapped to SIP Reason header fields, handling of SIP failure responses, mapping of SIP methods, modification of SDP, handling of 100 Trying provisional responses, deferring INVITE requests until preconditions are met, handling of 183 Session Progress provisional responses, codec selection, inclusion of PSTN XML body, support for early media, handling of 180 Ringing provisional responses, and procedures for releasing calls upon receiving CANCEL, BYE, or final error responses."
Describe the signalling interworking procedures between ISUP/BICC protocols and SIP-I based CS CN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.235.,"The signalling interworking procedures between ISUP/BICC protocols and SIP-I based circuit-switched core networks (CS CN) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.235 involve several key elements. 

For ISUP protocols, the interworking is facilitated by an Interworking Unit (IWU) which acts as a Type A or Type B exchange according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.764. The IWU ensures compatibility procedures for ISUP and supports services that are available within both the ISUP-based network and the SIP-I based CS CN. The control plane interworking between these networks is illustrated in figure 5.2.1 of the specification. The interworking procedures are based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 profile C, with clarifications provided within the specification.

Similarly, for BICC protocols, the IWU also acts as a Type A or Type B exchange to ensure compatibility procedures. The services supported through signalling interworking are limited to those available within both the BICC-based network and the SIP-I based CS CN. Specific rules for handling the Application Protocol Mechanism (APM) have been added, which are not specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5. The interworking procedures for BICC are also based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 profile C, with necessary clarifications provided.

In both cases, the IWU may apply additional procedures to support interworking for national-specific capabilities, although these are outside the scope of the document. The services that can be seamlessly interworked are listed in Table 5.2.1 of the specification.","The answer should cover the interworking procedures between ISUP/BICC protocols and SIP-I based CS CN, including the role of IWU as Type A or Type B exchange, the services supported within both networks, the control plane interworking, and the application of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 profile C. Additionally, it should mention any specific rules for handling mechanisms like APM in the context of BICC."
Describe the key elements and requirements of the E-UTRAN architecture as defined in 3GPP TS 25.912.,"The E-UTRAN architecture, as defined in 3GPP TS 25.912, consists of evolved NodeBs (eNBs) which provide the evolved UTRA user-plane (U-plane) and control-plane (C-plane) protocol terminations towards the User Equipment (UE). The eNBs are interconnected via the X2 interface, which is essential for supporting handover of UEs in LTE_ACTIVE mode. Additionally, eNBs are connected to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) through the S1 interface, which supports a many-to-many relationship between Access Gateways (aGWs) and eNBs.

The architecture is designed to meet several key requirements:
1. A single agreed E-UTRAN architecture, which is captured in clause 9.1.
2. The architecture is packet-based and supports various types of services, including real-time and conversational class traffic.
3. Minimization of single points of failure without additional cost for backhaul, with effects limited to eNB sites.
4. Simplification and minimization of the number of interfaces, with only two main interfaces: S1 (between EPC and eNB) and X2 (between eNBs).
5. Interaction between the Radio Network Layer (RNL) and Transport Network Layer (TNL) is not precluded, allowing for improved system performance.
6. Support for end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS), with the TNL providing the appropriate QoS requested by the RNL.
7. QoS mechanisms that differentiate various types of traffic, such as C-plane traffic, U-plane traffic, and Operations & Maintenance (O&M) traffic, ensuring efficient bandwidth utilization.
8. Minimization of delay variation (jitter) for packet communication, particularly for TCP/IP, by terminating radio interface protocols in the eNB and User Plane Entity (UPE), which helps reduce delay variations and data loss during UE mobility between eNBs.

Overall, the E-UTRAN architecture is designed to be robust, efficient, and capable of supporting a wide range of services with high performance and reliability.","The answer should include the definition of the evolved UTRAN architecture, the roles of eNBs, the significance of the X2 and S1 interfaces, and the connection to the EPC. It should also cover the requirements for a single agreed architecture, packet-based support, minimization of single points of failure, simplification of interfaces, interaction between RNL and TNL, end-to-end QoS support, differentiation of traffic types, and minimization of delay variation."
Describe the procedures and interactions involved in unicast resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.548.,"Unicast resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.548 involves several key procedures and interactions. The procedures include the activation and deactivation of bearers, modification of the Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics of a bearer, and modification of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) due to application requirements. The VAL client can request the VAL server to provide unicast resources, modify or release unicast resources, or perform network resource adaptation. These requests and modifications are detailed in clauses 6.2.2.2, 6.2.2.3, and 6.2.2.4 respectively.

Additionally, unicast resource management is supported through interactions with the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) and the Policy and Charging Control (PCC) for resource management. The PCRF procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 29.214, and the PCC procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 29.514. These interactions ensure that the network resources are appropriately managed and adapted to meet the requirements of the VAL service communication, which can consist of both unicast and multicast bearers needing modification due to the same event.

For detailed procedures, refer to the respective clauses in TS 24.548, which outline the specific steps and interactions involved in unicast resource management.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The procedures involved in unicast resource management, including activation/deactivation of bearers, modification of QoS characteristics, and modification of GBR.

"Explain the structure and encoding of Cell Load Information in the context of handover procedures, including details on downlink and uplink traffic load, as well as the specific values and their meanings.","The structure and encoding of Cell Load Information during handover procedures are defined in sub-clause 3.2.3.12. This information is crucial for understanding the traffic load of a cell, whether it is the source or target cell, and it applies to both downlink and uplink traffic loads.

For downlink traffic load, as described in Document 1, the information element contains details about the cell's load during a handover procedure. Similarly, Document 3 provides information about the uplink traffic load during a handover procedure. Both refer to the container structure and encoding defined in sub-clause 3.2.3.12.

According to Document 2, the Cell Load Information includes several key elements:

1. **Cell Capacity Class Value**: This value classifies the cell capacity relative to other cells and indicates resources configured for traffic purposes. It ranges from 1 to 100, where 1 indicates the minimum cell capacity and 100 indicates the maximum cell capacity. The values are binary coded integers, and there should be a linear relationship between cell capacity and the Cell Capacity Class Value.

2. **Load Value**: This represents the total cell load as a percentage of the maximum planned load. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the minimum load and 100 indicates the maximum load. The Load Value is measured on a linear scale and is also a binary coded integer.

3. **RT Load Value**: This indicates the percentage of the load generated by Real-Time (RT) traffic, which includes Conversational and Streaming traffic classes. The RT Load Value ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating no RT load and 100 indicating full RT load. Values outside this range are considered as no information.

4. **NRT Load Information Value**: This value indicates the load situation for Non-Real-Time (NRT) traffic, which includes Interactive and Background traffic classes. It ranges from 0 to 3, with the following meanings:
   - 0: NRT load is low.
   - 1: NRT load is medium.
   - 2: NRT load is high (low probability to admit a new user).
   - 3: NRT overload (low probability to admit a new user, packets are discarded, and the source is recommended to reduce the data flow).

These values help in assessing the load and capacity of a cell during handover procedures, providing essential information for managing traffic and ensuring efficient network performance.","The answer should include a comprehensive explanation of the Cell Load Information structure and encoding as defined in sub-clause 3.2.3.12. It should cover the downlink and uplink traffic load information during handover procedures, the meaning and range of Cell Capacity Class Value, Load Value, RT Load Value, and NRT Load Information Value. Additionally, it should explain how these values are used to indicate the load and capacity of a cell, and the implications of different values for real-time and non-real-time traffic."
"Explain the MBMS streaming delivery method and its functionalities, including its use on unicast and multicast, as well as the synchronization and QoE metrics involved.","The MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) streaming delivery method is designed to deliver continuous multimedia data, such as speech, audio, and video, over an MBMS bearer. This method is particularly useful for the multicast and broadcast of scheduled streaming content, complementing the download delivery method which focuses on the delivery of files.

When MBMS streaming delivery is used on unicast, the MBMS UE (User Equipment) performs the functions of a PSS (Packet-switched Streaming Service) client to deliver content when MBMS bearers are not usable or available, provided that an alternativeAccessDelivery element is available in the MBMS User Service Description. If multiple unicastAccessURI elements are available, the UE randomly selects one URI for unicast access to the service.

"Describe the process and requirements for mutual authentication between the MS and GANC-SEGW, including the use of certificates and traffic selectors.","The mutual authentication process between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Generic Access Network Controller-Security Gateway (GANC-SEGW) involves several steps and requirements. Firstly, the MS and GANC-SEGW set up one IKE Secure Association (SA) and one CHILD_SA for IPsec ESP according to predefined profiles. The MS acts as the initiator, while the GANC-SEGW acts as the responder.

For MS with SIM only, EAP-SIM is used for mutual authentication, whereas for MS with USIM, EAP-AKA is used. Additionally, the MS uses certificates to authenticate the GANC-SEGW. The MS must match the SubjectAltName in the end entity certificate with the IDr payload and the GANC-SEGW identity obtained from various sources such as provisioning, discovery, or register redirect.

The MS also uses Configuration Payload to acquire or renew an internal IP address in the network protected by the GANC-SEGW. During the Traffic Selector negotiation, the MS acts as the initiator and uses the following values for the traffic selector-initiator and traffic selector-responder payloads:
- TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255)
- TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255)

The GANC-SEGW uses the following values:
- TSi = (0, 0-65535, ms_internal_address - ms_internal_address), where ms_internal_address is the IP address assigned to the MS
- TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255)

Re-keying of the SA can be initiated by either the MS or GANC-SEGW based on their individual lifetime policy.

In conjunction with EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA, IKEv2 mandates the use of public key signature-based authentication of the GANC-SEGW to the MS. The MS must handle certificates according to specific requirements, including matching the SubjectAltName in the certificate with the expected IP address or FQDN of the GANC-SEGW. If multiple IPaddress or DNSname components are present in the SubjectAltName extension, at least one must match the expected value.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the GLR updates location information to the HLR, including the handling of responses and specific scenarios for both standard and GPRS location updates.","The GLR (Gateway Location Register) updates location information to the HLR (Home Location Register) based on specific criteria and procedures outlined in the specifications. 

Firstly, the GLR determines whether location updating needs to be indicated to the HLR by checking if it has the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) record. If the GLR has the IMSI record, it may not indicate the location updating to the HLR and instead invoke the HLR emulation function. However, there are certain cases where updating the location information to the HLR is necessary, even if the GLR stores the IMSI record. These cases are detailed in the procedures.

For standard location updates, the process involves several steps:
1. The GLR checks flags such as the CCBS (Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber) monitoring flag to perform the Location Updating Screening Function.
2. If location updating is required, the GLR sends an Update Location message to the HLR.
3. The GLR handles various response messages from the HLR:
   - Insert Subscriber Data message, which is processed by the Insert_Subscriber_Data_GLR procedure.
   - Forward Check SS indication message, which is relayed to the VLR (Visitor Location Register) without changing the current state.
   - Update Location acknowledgment message, indicating successful updating. The GLR sets the LSIC (Location and Subscriber Information) indicator to ","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the procedures and key elements involved in the Access Transfer of an IMS session from PS to CS domain, including the handling of conference calls and session release.","The Access Transfer of an IMS session from PS to CS domain involves several key procedures and elements:

1. **Initial Steps for Access Transfer**:
   - If the user is not attached to the CS domain at the time when the UE determines a need for Access Transfer to CS, the UE performs a CS Attach. This is followed by originating a session that uses CS media using the STN to establish an Access Leg via the CS access. The UE then requests Access Transfer of the IMS session to CS access.
   - Standard procedures are used in CS and IMS intermediate nodes, resulting in routing of the INVITE with the STN or an IMRN to the I/S-CSCF. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS includes the GRUU into the Access Transfer request if the user is registered in the IMS. If the user is not registered in IMS, CS/IMS Interworking Nodes include the C-MSISDN as the calling party number into the Access Transfer request.
   - The SCC AS completes the establishment of the Access Leg via the CS access, identifies the correct anchored session, and performs the Access Transfer by updating the Remote Leg with the connection information of the newly established Access Leg.

2. **Remote Leg Update Procedures**:
   - Upon receiving a request for execution of Access Transfer, the SCC AS performs the Remote Leg Update by switching the Access Leg communicating with the Remote Leg from Source Access Leg to Target Access Leg. This involves communicating the SDP of the Target Access Leg established to the remote end via the user's S-CSCF. The priority indication from the Target Access leg does not change the existing priority setting toward the remote leg.
   - For CS/PSTN Remote Party, the MGCF instructs MGW to update a termination towards the Target Access Leg to the context and to release the termination for the Source Access Leg from the context.

3. **Handling of Conference Calls**:
   - When the UE is using a conference service and Access Transfer between PS and CS access networks happens, the SCC AS provides the conference information (e.g., conference URI, identifier of all participants) to the MSC Server on the Target Access Leg. The MSC Server then creates a conference state in the CS access network.
   - If multiple multi-media sessions including a conference exist, the conference information is included in the session state information sent by the SCC AS to the MSC Server. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs conference control on behalf of the UE, while the MSC Server not enhanced for ICS performs conference control after the Access Transfer.

4. **Session Modification and Source Access Leg Release**:
   - When the session modification procedures are complete, the Source Access Leg Release is executed by initiating a session release. For non-emergency sessions, the UE and the SCC AS initiate the Session Release procedure when the switch to the Target Access Leg is complete. For emergency sessions, the UE and the EATF initiate the Session Release procedure when the switch to the Target Access Leg is complete.
   - For (v)SRVCC, the source access leg release is only performed if the UE retains Gm after the PS-CS access transfer is completed; otherwise, the UE releases the source access leg locally.

These procedures ensure a seamless transition of IMS sessions from PS to CS domain, maintaining session continuity and handling special cases like conference calls effectively.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The initial steps for Access Transfer from PS to CS, including CS Attach and session establishment using CS media.
- The procedures for Remote Leg Update, including the communication of SDP and handling of priority indications.
- The handling of conference calls during Access Transfer, including the provision of conference information by the SCC AS and the creation of conference state in CS access network.

Describe the principles and procedures involved in Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC) and Configuration Transfer between different RAN nodes as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 and TS 23.402 documents.,"The principles and procedures involved in Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC) and Configuration Transfer between different RAN nodes are detailed in the 3GPP TS 23.401 and TS 23.402 documents.

Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC) from E-UTRAN to GERAN follows the principles of Network Assisted Cell Change between UTRAN and GERAN. It specifies the RAN Information Management (RIM) procedures, which are crucial for facilitating the NACC process. The support for NACC impacts various nodes such as BSC, eNodeB, MME, and SGSN, as well as network interfaces like Gb, Iu, S3, Gn, and S1, and radio interfaces Um and Uu.

Configuration Transfer between eNodeBs involves the exchange of arbitrary information between applications belonging to the RAN nodes. This process uses E-UTRAN transparent containers to transfer information via the MME core network node(s). The transparent containers include source and target eNodeB addresses, allowing the Core Network nodes to route the messages. Configuration Transfer messages are used to carry the E-UTRAN transparent container from the source E-UTRAN node to the destination E-UTRAN node, with the MME providing addressing, routing, and relaying functions.

Support for E-UTRAN-HRPD Inter-RAT SON involves the use of RIM procedures and specific addressing mechanisms. The MME performs relaying between S1 and S121 messages, ensuring proper routing based on the destination address. The architecture for this support is depicted in the relevant figures within the documents.

Overall, the principles and procedures outlined in these documents ensure efficient and transparent information exchange between different RAN nodes, facilitating seamless network operations and transitions.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The principles of Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC) from E-UTRAN to GERAN, including the affected nodes, network interfaces, and radio interfaces.

- The support for E-UTRAN-HRPD Inter-RAT SON, including the addressing mechanisms and the relaying functions performed by the MME."
"Describe the measurement of packet delay in 5G networks, including the different types of delays, their calculation methods, and their significance for QoS monitoring.","In 5G networks, packet delay measurement is crucial for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and involves various types of delays across different network components. 

The average GTP packet delay DL on the F1-U interface is one such measurement. It is calculated by taking the time when a GTP packet is received from the gNB-DU at the ingress GTP termination of the GNBCUUPFunction, subtracting the time when the same packet was sent to the gNB-DU from the GTP egress termination of the GNBCUUPFunction, and then subtracting the feedback delay time (including queuing delay) in the gNB-DU. The result is divided by two. This measurement is performed per PLMN ID, per QoS level, and per S-NSSAI, and is represented in 0.1 millisecond units. The measurement name format is DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl_Filter, where the filter is a combination of PLMN ID, QoS level, and S-NSSAI. This measurement is used for performance assurance within the integrity area, specifically for user plane connection quality.

Immediate MDT (Minimization of Drive Tests) is supported for various scenarios such as (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC, and NR-DC. In signalling-based immediate MDT, the MME provides MDT configuration for both MN and SN, including multi RAT SN configuration. In management-based immediate MDT, the OAM provides the MDT configuration independently to both MN and SN. For configuring UL PDCP packet average delay in case of split bearers, only the terminated node of the split bearer can configure the measurement to the UE, and the UE reports the measurement result to the corresponding node.

The objective of the UL PDCP packet average delay measurement performed by the UE is to measure packet delay in the PDCP layer for QoS verification of MDT or QoS monitoring. The UE measures UL PDCP queueing delay at the DRB level, and it is up to the gNB to convert DRB level delay to QoS level delay, assuming all QoS flows mapped to the same DRB receive the same QoS treatment.

Packet delay includes both the RAN part and the CN part. The RAN part of DL packet delay measurement comprises delays in the over-the-air interface (D1), gNB-DU (D2), F1-U interface (D3), and CU-UP (D4). Similarly, the RAN part of UL packet delay measurement includes UL PDCP packet average delay (D1), over-the-air interface packet delay (D2.1), RLC packet delay (D2.2), F1-U interface delay (D2.3), and PDCP re-ordering delay (D2.4). These measurements are performed per DRB per UE and are applicable for QoS monitoring as defined in TS 23.501. The unit of these delay measurements is 0.1ms.

Overall, these packet delay measurements are essential for monitoring and ensuring QoS in 5G networks, providing detailed insights into the performance of various network components and their impact on user experience.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Explanation of average GTP packet delay DL on the F1-U interface, including its calculation method and significance.

Describe the supported content types and multipart message structure for HTTP messages in 3GPP TS 29.540 and TS 29.500.,"The supported content types for HTTP messages in 3GPP TS 29.540 include the JSON format (IETF RFC 8259), signalled by the content type 'application/json', the Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807), signalled by the content type 'application/problem+json', and the JSON Patch format (IETF RFC 6902), signalled by the content type 'application/json-patch+json'. Additionally, multipart messages are supported using the content type 'multipart/related', which comprises one JSON body part with the 'application/json' content type and one binary body part with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.

The structure of HTTP multipart messages, as detailed in 3GPP TS 29.540, includes a JSON body part as the 'root' body part, encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The multipart message must include a 'type' parameter specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e., 'application/json'. The binary body part must include a Content-ID header, and the JSON body part must reference the binary body part using the Content-ID header field.

In 3GPP TS 29.500, the JSON format described in IETF RFC 8259 is used as the serialization protocol. For transmitting large parts of opaque binary data along with JSON format, multipart messages are supported using a multipart/related media type, 3gpp vendor specific content subtype, and cross-referencing from the JSON payload using the Content-ID field.","The answer should cover the supported content types such as JSON format, Problem Details JSON Object, and JSON Patch.

"Describe the process and actions involved in DNS message handling by the EASDF as instructed by the SMF, including the creation and application of DNS rules.","The process of DNS message handling by the EASDF as instructed by the SMF involves several key steps and actions. 

Firstly, the SMF can create 'One-Time' DNS rules to apply specific actions to a particular DNS message that has been previously buffered and reported by the EASDF. These rules include a DNS message identifier that uniquely identifies the DNS message within the DNS context and the requested actions to be applied. Once the EASDF receives a DNSContext Update request with such a rule, it applies the specified actions to the identified DNS message and then deletes the rule. If no buffered DNS message corresponds to the identifier, the EASDF rejects the request with an error.

Secondly, the SMF can instruct the EASDF to apply various actions to DNS messages matching a DNS rule. These actions include:
1. Reporting the DNS message content to the SMF. The SMF can request a report only once for the first matching DNS message, and can reset this indication to receive another report for the next matching message.
2. Buffering the DNS message.
3. Forwarding the DNS message, potentially to a specific DNS server address provided by the SMF or a pre-configured local DNS server. The SMF can also request the EASDF to build or replace an EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option in the DNS Query message.
4. Discarding the DNS message.

When forwarding DNS messages, the EASDF handles ECS options by either removing them or replacing them based on the configuration and the instructions from the SMF.

Lastly, the EASDF reports the contents of DNS messages matching a DNS rule provisioned with the action to report. These reports are sent to the SMF and may include one or more DNS message identifiers, uniquely identifying the reported DNS messages within the DNS context.

Overall, the EASDF follows the instructions from the SMF to manage DNS messages through the creation and application of DNS rules, ensuring proper handling and reporting as specified.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
1. Explanation of 'One-Time' DNS rules and their application to specific DNS messages using DNS message identifiers.

Describe the measurement quantities and reporting criteria for intra-frequency events in 3GPP TS 25.331.,"In 3GPP TS 25.331, intra-frequency events are evaluated using specific measurement quantities. These quantities include Downlink Ec/N0, Downlink path loss, Downlink received signal code power (RSCP) after despreading, and ISCP measured on a Timeslot basis. For Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), path loss is calculated using the formula: Pathloss in dB = Primary CPICH Tx power - CPICH RSCP, where both the Primary CPICH Tx power and CPICH RSCP are measured in dBm. For Time Division Duplex (TDD), path loss is calculated using the formula: Pathloss in dB = Primary CCPCH TX power - Primary CCPCH RSCP, with both measurements also in dBm. Path loss results are rounded up to the next higher integer if necessary, with results higher than 158 reported as 158 and results lower than 46 reported as 46.

It includes three main elements: TFO_Version (4 bits), TFO_Subversion (4 bits), and Selector (5 bits). The TFO_Version and TFO_Subversion are specified in Annex H, and a TFO implementation of Release 5 or onwards must send this TFO_Version. If omitted, a lower version is assumed by the receiving side. The Selector indicates the type of extension and the number of additional extension blocks, with '00000' indicating no further extensions and '10101' being disallowed for improved distinction against the TFO_Header.

Codec Mismatch Resolution and Codec Type Optimisation aim to find the optimal TFO codec type and configuration for a TFO connection. Codec Mismatch Resolution is invoked when TFO establishment is not possible with the current codec types, while Codec Type Optimisation may occur during an ongoing TFO connection if the capabilities of one radio leg change. These features are optional, and if unsupported by one radio leg, the codec list in TFO_REQ_L and TFO_ACK_L messages is restricted to the local used codec. If supported, these procedures are performed every time a new codec list is sent or received.

Immediate Codec Type Optimisation is performed during TFO establishment to avoid delays and disturbances in ongoing calls. It involves switching the codec type at the local and/or distant side to achieve a preferred TFO configuration. This optimisation is effective only in TFO version 5 or higher and uses information from TFO_REQ and TFO_ACK messages, similar to the Codec_List in TFO_REQ_L and TFO_ACK_L messages but signalled differently.

"Describe the structure and identification elements of CBSP messages as defined in TS 48.049, including the differences in identification for regular and emergency messages.","The structure of CBSP (Cell Broadcast Service Protocol) messages as defined in TS 48.049 includes several key components. Each CBSP message consists of a Message Type Information Element (IE), a Length Indicator IE, and potentially a set of additional information elements. The specific order of these information elements can vary depending on the type of CBSP message, and there is no general rule for their arrangement.

For regular CBSP messages, identification is achieved through four elements: the Message Identifier IE, Serial Number IE, Channel Indicator IE, and the 'Cell Identifier' field included in the Cell List IE. This means that even if two CBSP messages have the same semantic content, such as a weather forecast, but are in different languages or coding schemes, they are considered distinct and must be identified by different quartets.

Emergency CBSP messages, on the other hand, are uniquely identified by three elements: the Message Identifier IE, Serial Number IE, and the 'Cell Identifier' field included in the Cell List IE. This streamlined identification process ensures that emergency messages are quickly and accurately recognized.

The tabular format summarizing CBSP messages is provided in Table 8.1.1.1, which lists the information elements in their order of appearance for each type of CBSP message. This table serves as a reference for understanding the structure and components of various CBSP messages.","The answer should include the following key details:

- If the UE is in an in-coverage state during a V2X test scenario, or if it is not a V2X test scenario, the UE behavior is unspecified.
- Otherwise, the UE activates the test mode.

When the UE test mode is active, the UE operates normally with the following exceptions:
- The UE shall accept any request to establish a data radio bearer with an associated EPS bearer context, both included in the same RRC message, and within the radio access capabilities of the UE.
- Optionally, if the UE supports CSG Proximity Indication, the UE shall ignore any non-3GPP radio signals used in determining proximity to a CSG cell and delete any previously stored cell information for proximity detection.

"How is user consent managed and enforced for accessing UE location information in 3GPP networks, and what are the procedures for obtaining and handling UE location information?","User consent management for accessing UE location information in 3GPP networks is crucial and is governed by local regulations and operator policies. The EES (Edge Enabler Server) acts as the consent enforcement entity when accessing 5GC network services directly, as specified in TS 33.558. If the EES utilizes 5GC services via NEF (Network Exposure Function), the NEF enforces user consent.

To manage user consent, the EES must check the user consent for the targeted UE by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM, as outlined in TS 29.503. If user consent is not granted, the EES rejects the request with an HTTP '403 Forbidden' status code, including a 'USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED' error. If consent is granted, the EES processes the request to retrieve UE location information.

The procedure for the EAS (Edge Application Server) to request UE location information from the EES involves sending an HTTP POST message to the EES with the UE identifier and the desired location accuracy. Upon receiving the request, the EES verifies the identity and authorization of the EAS. If authorized, the EES checks for locally cached UE location information and returns it if available. If not, the EES obtains the location information from the 3GPP core network and responds with the data in the requested format. Error handling and redirection mechanisms are also in place, as specified in TS 29.558.

Requesting UE's User Consent Subscription Data from the UDM involves sending a GET request with the UE's identity and query parameters indicating the purpose and supported features. The UDM responds with the relevant user consent data or an appropriate error status code, as detailed in TS 29.503.","The answer should cover the following key details:

What are the requirements for UE initial transmission timing error as specified in TS 38.533 4.4.1.0.1?,"The requirements for UE initial transmission timing error as specified in TS 38.533 4.4.1.0.1 are as follows:

1. **Timing Error Limit Value (Te)**: The UE initial transmission timing error must be less than or equal to Te, which is specified in Table 4.4.1.0.1-1. This requirement applies to the first transmission in a DRX cycle for PUCCH, PUSCH, SRS, or PRACH transmission.

2. **Conditions for Te Requirement**: The UE must meet the Te requirement for an initial transmission if at least one SSB is available at the UE during the last 160 ms.

3. **Reference Point for UE Initial Transmit Timing Control**: The reference point is the downlink timing of the reference cell minus a certain value. The downlink timing is defined as the time when the first detected path of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference cell.

4. **NTA for PRACH and Other Channels**: NTA for PRACH is defined as 0. For other channels, it is the difference between UE transmission timing and the downlink timing immediately after the last timing advance was applied. NTA for other channels does not change until the next timing advance is received. The value depends on the duplex mode of the cell and the frequency range, as defined in Table 4.4.1.0.1-2.

5. **Adjusting UE Uplink Timing**: When the transmission timing error between the UE and the reference timing exceeds Te, the UE must adjust its timing to within Te. The reference timing is before the downlink timing of the reference cell. Adjustments to the UE uplink timing must follow these rules:
   - The maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment is Tq.
   - The minimum aggregate adjustment rate is Tp per second.
   - The maximum aggregate adjustment rate is Tq per 200 ms.

6. **Maximum Autonomous Time Adjustment Step (Tq) and Aggregate Adjustment Rate (Tp)**: These values are specified in Table 4.4.1.0.1-3.

Describe the process and requirements for P-CSCF restoration enhancement as defined in 3GPP specifications.,"The P-CSCF restoration enhancement process is defined under specific conditions where both the PCF and SMF support the PCF-based P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement feature. This feature is controlled by the 'PCSCF-Restoration-Enhancement' and involves several key steps and roles for different network functions.

1. **Conditions for Applicability**: The enhancement is applicable when both the PCF and SMF support the PCF-based P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380. Additionally, the P-CSCF must send a restoration request to the PCF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 and 3GPP TS 29.514.

2. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - **PCF (Policy Control Function)**: Upon receiving a restoration request from the P-CSCF, the PCF sends a notification (HTTP POST message) to the SMF, including the 'pcscfRestIndication' attribute set to true for the corresponding PDU session. The PCF also identifies the PDU session for which the request applies and handles errors if the session is not available.
   - **SMF (Session Management Function)**: The SMF acknowledges the notification from the PCF and initiates the corresponding QoS flow procedures for the IMS PDU connection.
   - **P-CSCF (Proxy-Call Session Control Function)**: Acts as a network function service consumer and sends restoration requests to the PCF. It includes necessary session information such as the UE's IP address, IP-Domain-ID, IMSI, and APN in the request.
   - **PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function)**: In cases where PCRF-based restoration is applicable, the P-CSCF sends an AAR command to the PCRF, which includes session information required to find the corresponding IP-CAN session. The PCRF acknowledges the command and sends a restoration request to the PCEF.

3. **Attributes and Information Required**:
   - **Restoration Requests**: The P-CSCF includes the UE's IP address, IP-Domain-ID, IMSI, and APN in the restoration request. If the IP address is not unique or available, alternative identifiers such as SUPI and DNN are used.
   - **Notification to SMF**: The PCF sends a notification to the SMF with the 'pcscfRestIndication' attribute set to true.

4. **Acknowledgment and Error Handling**:
   - **PCF**: Acknowledges the restoration request and sends a '204 No content' response if successful. If the PDU session cannot be identified, it sends an HTTP '500 Internal Server Error' response with the 'cause' attribute set to 'PDU_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE'.
   - **PCRF**: Acknowledges the AAR command with an AAA command and includes the 'Auth-Session-State' AVP set to 'NO_STATE_MAINTAINED'.

5. **Negotiation of Optional Features**: The optional features for the Npcf_SMPolicyControl API are negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 29.500. These features are listed in table 5.8-1 of 3GPP TS 29.512.

Overall, the P-CSCF restoration enhancement process involves coordinated actions between the PCF, SMF, P-CSCF, and PCRF, with specific requirements for session information, acknowledgment, and error handling to ensure successful restoration.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The conditions under which P-CSCF restoration enhancement is applicable.
  - The roles of PCF, SMF, P-CSCF, and PCRF in the restoration process.
  - The specific attributes and information required in the restoration requests.
  - The acknowledgment and error handling procedures.

Describe the procedures and message flows involved in the GA-PSR TC activation and data transfer in the context of MS initiated and GANC initiated processes as specified in TS 44.318.,"The GA-PSR TC activation and data transfer procedures involve several steps and conditions for both MS initiated and GANC initiated processes. 

For MS initiated GA-PSR TC activation, the process is triggered by an uplink GPRS user data request when the GA-PSR is in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state. The message flow and timers involved in this procedure are depicted in Figure 8.2.1 of TS 44.318. The MS sends a request to activate the transport channel, and various messages and timers are used to manage this activation process.

Once the GA-PSR TC is activated, the GANC can immediately forward any downlink GPRS user data packets to the MS. The GANC sends the GA-PSR UNITDATA message to the MS using the existing GA-PSR TC, which includes the MS IP address and UDP port number. The GANC increments the downlink packet sequence number for each GA-PSR-UNITDATA message sent to the MS, ensuring proper sequencing of the data packets.

During the GA-PSR TC activation procedure, if the MS receives a downlink message while the TU4002 timer is still running, it processes the request as if the transport channel was active. However, the MS does not initiate uplink GPRS user data transfer until the GA-PSR TC activation procedure is successfully completed. The MS uses the IP address and UDP port number received in the GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC ACK message for sending uplink GPRS user data packets to the GANC on the activated transport channel.

In summary, the MS initiated GA-PSR TC activation involves specific triggers and states, detailed message flows, and timers. The GANC handles downlink data packets using established transport channels and sequence numbers, while the MS processes downlink messages during activation and uses provided IP and UDP details for uplink data transfer once activation is complete.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The conditions under which MS initiated GA-PSR TC activation occurs, including the state and triggers.
  - The message flow and timers involved in the MS initiated GA-PSR TC activation.
  - The process for handling downlink GPRS user data packets by the GANC once GA-PSR TC is activated, including the use of IP address and UDP port number.
  - The procedure for MS handling downlink messages during GA-PSR TC activation, including the role of the TU4002 timer and the conditions for initiating uplink GPRS user data transfer."
"What are the minimum requirements for spurious emissions for UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR as specified in the 3GPP TS 37.105 and TS 38.104 documents?","The minimum requirements for spurious emissions for UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR are specified in different subclauses of the 3GPP TS 37.105 and TS 38.104 documents.

For UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause 9.7.6.3.3 of TS 37.105. This subclause details the limits for spurious emissions for UTRA FDD BS in geographic coverage areas where systems operate in other frequency bands. The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits outlined in several tables:
- Table 9.7.6.3.3-1: OTA AAS BS Spurious emissions limits for UTRA FDD BS.
- Table 9.7.6.3.3-2: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for BS in geographic coverage area of PHS.

What are the minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements and reporting delays as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.133?,"The minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements and reporting delays are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.521 clause 8.16.84.3 and referenced in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.1 and A.8.16.96. According to these specifications, when no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is in use, the User Equipment (UE) must be able to identify a new detectable Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or Time Division Duplex (TDD) cell on a secondary component carrier within a time period defined as Tidentify_scc, which is calculated as 20 times the parameter measCycleSCell. 

A cell is considered detectable when certain conditions are met, including the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) related side conditions specified in clause 9.1 for the corresponding band, and the Synchronization Channel (SCH) power and SCH signal-to-interference ratio as per Annex B.2.7 for the corresponding band. The measurement period for deactivated secondary cell (SCell) measurements is defined as Tmeasure_scc, which is 5 times the parameter measCycleSCell. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) measurements for up to 8 identified cells on a secondary component carrier and report these measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of Tmeasure_scc.

The measurement accuracy for all measured cells must comply with the specifications in TS 36.133 clause 9.1.11, which covers carrier aggregation measurement accuracy. Additionally, the UE may reconfigure the receiver bandwidth or turn on/off one of the RF chains when performing measurements on one or two secondary component carriers with deactivated SCells, potentially causing interruptions on the primary cell (PCell) or an activated SCell, as specified in clause 7.8.

Event triggered measurement reports must meet the requirements in clause 9, and the UE should not send any event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled. The measurement reporting delay, defined as the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface, must be less than Tidentify_scc as defined in TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.1, excluding delays caused by other Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling on the Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) and the delay uncertainty from inserting the report into the Transmission Time Interval (TTI) of the uplink DCCH.

If a cell that has been detectable for at least the time period Tidentify_scc becomes undetectable for a period of 5 seconds or less and then becomes detectable again, triggering an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than Tmeasure_scc, provided the timing to that cell has not changed by more than 50 Ts and the Layer 3 (L3) filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is used or Interference Detection and Cancellation (IDC) autonomous denial is configured, additional delays can be expected.","The answer should include the minimum conformance requirements for UE measurements as specified in TS 36.521 clause 8.16.84.3, referencing TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.1 and A.8.16.96.

Describe the key functionalities and protocols involved in IMS conferencing and messaging services as defined in 3GPP TS 24.147 and TS 24.247.,"The IMS conferencing and messaging services, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.147 and TS 24.247, provide a comprehensive framework for communication within the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). 

For IMS conferencing services, the key functionalities include the ability for users to initiate, modify, and terminate media sessions using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as defined in RFC 3261. The conferencing service allows users to create, manage, terminate, join, and leave conferences, and provides the network with the ability to give information about these conferences to the involved parties. Membership and media policies can be applied by the network operator or the user. The protocols used to realize the 3GPP conference service include SIP, Session Description Protocol (SDP), and Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP). The functional split for SIP-based conferences involves the Application Server (AS), Media Resource Function Controller (MRFC), and Media Resource Function Processor (MRFP). The framework for SIP conferences is specified in RFC 4353, and the architecture for the 3GPP conference service is detailed in 3GPP TS 23.228 and 3GPP TS 23.218.

For IMS messaging services, the key functionalities include the ability for users to send or receive single messages immediately to/from another user and to create and participate in messaging conferences. This service can utilize SIP for instant messaging and the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) for session-based messaging. Immediate messaging can be conducted using page-mode messaging as defined in RFC 3428 or session-mode messaging as defined in RFC 4975, RFC 6714, and RFC 6135. The functional split for session-mode messaging between AS, MRFC, and MRFP is similar to that described for SIP-based conferences in 3GPP TS 24.147.

"Describe the media profiles for audio as defined in TS 26.118, including the constraints and signalling requirements for elementary streams, file format encapsulation, and DASH Adaptation Sets.","The media profiles for audio as defined in TS 26.118 encompass several key aspects to ensure proper functionality and compatibility. These profiles include constraints and signalling requirements for elementary streams, file format encapsulation, and DASH Adaptation Sets.

Elementary stream constraints are based on the audio operation points defined in clause 6.1. These constraints ensure that the audio streams adhere to specific parameters that optimize performance and compatibility across different devices and platforms.

File format encapsulation constraints and signalling requirements are crucial for defining how audio data is packaged and transmitted. This includes capability signalling, which allows devices to communicate their capabilities and ensure that the audio data is properly interpreted and played back.

DASH Adaptation Set constraints and signalling requirements define the DASH content format profile. DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is a protocol used for streaming media over the internet, and these constraints ensure that audio content is delivered efficiently and adapts to varying network conditions.

When the target TCI state is known, the UE must be able to receive PDCCH with the target TCI state of the serving cell on which the TCI state switch occurs no later than at slot n + TRRC_processing + TOk*(Tfirst-SSB + TSSB-proc) / NR slot length. The UE is not required to receive PDCCH/PDSCH or transmit PUCCH/PUSCH until the end of the switching period.

When the target TCI state is unknown, the UE must be able to receive PDCCH with the target TCI state of the serving cell on which the TCI state switch occurs no later than at slot n + TRRC_processing + TL1-RSRP + TOuk*(Tfirst-SSB + TSSB-proc) / NR slot length. The UE is not required to receive PDCCH/PDSCH or transmit PUCCH/PUSCH until the end of the switching period.

The requirements for RRC-based TCI state switch delay apply when only one TCI state is configured in the RRC TCI state list. When a longer switching delay is allowed, it is the time between DL data transmission and acknowledgment as specified in TS 38.213.

Regarding UE performance requirements for RRC procedures, the delay is defined as the time in milliseconds from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-alignment. This excludes delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure, or physical layer synchronization. In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay includes the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133, clause 8.6.3.","The answer should include the specific conditions under which the TCI state is considered known or unknown, detailing the requirements for UE to receive PDCCH with the target TCI state.

Additionally, the answer should explain the UE performance requirements for RRC procedures, including the definition of N and the exclusion of certain delays. Finally, it should address the impact of BWP switching on RRC procedure delays."

Describe the spurious emissions requirements for MSR AAS BS and co-location with other base stations as specified in 3GPP TS 37.105 and TS 37.104.,"The spurious emissions requirements for MSR AAS BS are outlined in 3GPP TS 37.105. The general spurious emissions basic limits are provided in table 7.6.2.1-1. For each applicable basic limit specified in this table for each TAB connector RX min cell group, the power sum of emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector RX min cell group must not exceed the AAS BS limit, which is defined as the basic limit plus 10log10(NRXU,countedpercell), unless regional regulations state otherwise. Additionally, the requirements in 3GPP TS 37.104 subclause 6.6.1.3 form basic limits for additional receiver spurious emission requirements. For FDD BS (BC1 and BC2), the levels specified for the protection of BS receivers of own or different BS in subclause 6.6.1.2 of TS 37.104 form basic levels for additional receiver spurious emission requirements. Co-location requirements specified in subclause 6.6.1.4 of TS 37.104 may also form basic levels for co-location spurious emission requirements.

Conformance to the AAS BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can be demonstrated by either ensuring the sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each TAB connector in the TAB connector RX min cell group is less than or equal to the AAS BS limit for the respective frequency span, or by ensuring the spurious emissions power at each TAB connector is less than or equal to the AAS BS limit for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log10(n), where n is the number of TAB connectors in the TAB connector RX min cell group.

Regarding co-location with other base stations, the requirements specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 subclause 6.6.1.4 are applicable for the protection of other BS receivers when technologies such as GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NB-IoT, and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

"Describe the requirements and functionalities of the Test Administration Platform's GUI as specified in TS 26.259, and explain the role and configurations of Anchor Conditions in Renderer Comparison Tests.","The Test Administration Platform's Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to facilitate the presentation and assessment of audio samples in Renderer Comparison Tests. The GUI includes several key functionalities and constraints:

1. **Switch Buttons**: The GUI features 'A' and 'B' switch buttons that allow assessors to seamlessly switch between the audio presentations of the A and B samples for comparison.
2. **Play Button**: This button enables Time-Synchronized Playback of the A and B samples, where one sample is a bit-stream for the Test Condition and the other is an Anchor Condition.
3. **Stop Button**: The Stop button allows assessors to stop the Time-Synchronized Playback of the samples.
4. **Audio Quality Attributes**: The GUI presents four Audio Quality Attributes for assessment: Timbre (TIM), Spatial (SPA), Artefacts (ART), and Basic Audio Quality (BAQ). Additionally, it includes a loudness scale for comparing the Loudness (LOUD) of the A and B samples.
5. **Loop Button**: This button enables looping the Time-Synchronized playback of the samples.
6. **Next Button**: The Next button allows assessors to proceed to the next trial in the experiment. It is enabled only after the assessment of TIM, SPA, and BAQ has been completed. All source Test Materials are normalized for Listening Level according to the specified clause.

The Test Administration Platform also supports real-time implementations of the Audio Profile Renderer under test and the Anchor Conditions, with head-tracking capabilities.

In Renderer Comparison Tests, two Anchor/Reference Conditions are included. These Anchors correspond to two configurations of a Common Informative Binaural Rendering (CIBR) scheme (1st and 3rd order). The CIBR scheme involves several processes:

1. **Input Conversion**: The CIBR receives a virtual loudspeaker representation, obtained using a Documented Loudspeaker Renderer, with speaker locations positioned according to an Equivalent Spatial Domain (ESD) representation.
2. **B-format Representation**: The ESD representation is converted to a 1st order or 3rd order B-format representation.
3. **Sound Field Rotation**: The sound field is rotated according to a motion sensor signal.
4. **Binauralization**: The audio signal is binauralized for presentation.

"Describe the periodic location updating procedure in mobile stations as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008, including the role of timer T3212 and the conditions under which the procedure is triggered or delayed.","The periodic location updating procedure in mobile stations is used to notify the network periodically about the availability of the mobile station. This procedure is controlled by the timer T3212, which is started each time the mobile station enters the MM IDLE substate NORMAL SERVICE or ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE. The timer continues running until explicitly stopped.

The timer T3212 is stopped and reset to its initial value when:
- A LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT or LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is received.
- An AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received.
- The first MM message is received, or security mode setting is completed during MM connection establishment, except when the most recent service state is LIMITED SERVICE.
- The mobile station responds to paging and receives the first correct layer 3 message, except RR message.
- The mobile station is deactivated (powered down or SIM/USIM removed).

When the timer T3212 expires, the location updating procedure is initiated, and the timer is reset to its initial value. If the mobile station is not in the MM Idle state when the timer expires, the procedure is delayed until the MM Idle state is entered.

The periodic location updating procedure is influenced by the service state of the mobile station. If the mobile station is in service states such as NO CELL AVAILABLE, LIMITED SERVICE, PLMN SEARCH, or PLMN SEARCH-NORMAL SERVICE when the timer expires, the procedure is delayed until these states are left.

In A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode, the procedure is not started if the BCCH information indicates that periodic location updating should not be used. The timeout value is broadcasted in the L3-RR SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message on the BCCH. In UTRAN Iu mode, the procedure is not started if the information on BCCH or the last received dedicated system information indicates that periodic location updating should not be used.

When a mobile station configured for CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a GERAN or UTRAN cell after an intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode in NMO II, and the location area of the current cell is the same as the stored location area, the mobile station starts timer T3212 with a value set to the shorter of the remaining value of timer T3412 and the broadcast T3212 timeout value.

When a mobile station supporting N1 mode in MS operation modes A or B moves from NG-RAN coverage to GERAN or UTRAN coverage, and the network operates in network operation mode II, the location area of the current cell is the same as the stored location area, the broadcast value of T3212 does not indicate 'deactivated,' and the T3212 has expired, the mobile station may initiate the periodic location updating procedure.

If the broadcast T3212 timeout value changes while the timer is running, the mobile station restarts the timer with the value t modulo t1, where t1 is the new timeout value and t is the current timer value. If the timer is not running, the mobile station starts the new timer with a value randomly drawn between 0 and t1.

The Control Channel Description information element provides information about a cell, including the timeout value for periodic location updating, which is relevant for determining whether the procedure should be initiated.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of periodic updating and its purpose.
  - Detailed description of timer T3212, including how it is started, stopped, and reset.
  - Conditions under which the periodic location updating procedure is triggered or delayed.
  - Impact of different service states on the procedure.

"Describe the procedures and considerations involved in determining the initial position for an emergency service call, including privacy settings and overrides.","The process of determining the initial position for an emergency service call involves several steps and considerations. Initially, when a subscriber initiates an emergency call, the idle User Equipment (UE) requests radio connection setup, indicating the emergency call request to the VMSC/MSC server via the Radio Access Network (RAN). The RAN then conveys the CM service request to the core network, and the UE may identify itself using a TMSI, IMSI, or IMEI.

The VMSC/MSC server determines the appropriate emergency services client based on the serving cell and continues the normal procedure for emergency call origination. Depending on local regulatory requirements, the sending of call setup information into the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) may be delayed until the UE's location has been obtained, the location attempt has failed, or a predefined timer has expired. If the serving cell serves an area with multiple emergency services clients, the VMSC/MSC server may delay call setup and invoke location-based routing procedures.

At any time after the initial request, the VMSC/MSC server may initiate procedures to obtain the UE's location and optionally, velocity. These procedures can run in parallel with the emergency call origination.

Privacy settings and overrides are crucial in this process. The Privacy Override Indicator (POI) is used to determine whether the subscriber's privacy settings should be overridden by the request for location services.

"What are the beam correspondence requirements for power class 7 UEs, and how are they verified under different conditions?","The beam correspondence requirements for power class 7 UEs are defined by several key parameters and conditions. 

Firstly, the minimum and maximum output power values for EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) and TRP (Total Radiated Power), as well as spherical coverage requirements, are specified. The minimum output power values for EIRP are detailed in Table 6.2.1.7-1, while the maximum output power values for TRP and EIRP are found in Table 6.2.1.7-2. The spherical coverage requirement, which is the minimum EIRP at the 50th percentile of the distribution of radiated power measured over the full sphere around the UE, is provided in Table 6.2.1.7-3. For UEs supporting multiple FR2 bands, these requirements are adjusted by specific relaxation parameters.

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs consists of two main components: the UE minimum peak EIRP and the UE spherical coverage. These requirements are fulfilled if the UE meets one of the following conditions based on its capability to support beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping:
- If beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping is supported, the UE must meet the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements using its autonomously chosen UL beams without uplink beam sweeping.
- If both beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping and beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16 are supported, the UE must meet the requirements using the side conditions for SSB-based enhanced beam correspondence.
- If both beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping and beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16 are supported, the UE must meet the requirements using the side conditions for CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence.

For beam correspondence based on CSI-RS, the side conditions include the provision of downlink reference signals (both SSB and CSI-RS), fulfillment of the reference measurement channel according to the CSI-RS configuration, and specific conditions for L1-RSRP measurements.

For beam correspondence based on SSB, the side conditions include the provision of the downlink reference signal SSB and the fulfillment of conditions for L1-RSRP measurements.

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the following applicability rules apply:
- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements based on either SSB or CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the requirements for both.
- If a UE supports either SSB-based or CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet the supported enhanced beam correspondence requirements.
- If a UE supports both SSB-based and CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence, it must meet both sets of requirements. Verification involves meeting the SSB-based enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the minimum peak EIRP requirement using the CSI-RS-based side conditions. If the UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement using the CSI-RS-based side conditions, further verification is required using the CSI-RS-based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions.

These comprehensive requirements ensure that power class 7 UEs maintain effective beam correspondence under various conditions and configurations.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The minimum and maximum output power values for EIRP and TRP, and spherical coverage requirements for power class 7 UEs as defined in Document 1.

"Explain the procedure for establishing cryptographic protection for radio bearers in 3GPP access as specified in TS 33.501, including the role of NAS messages, key derivation, and the handling of Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimization.","The procedure for establishing cryptographic protection for radio bearers in 3GPP access begins with the UE initiating a NAS Service Request message or Registration Request message that includes 'PDU session(s) to be re-activated' to the AMF. If the Registration Request does not include 'PDU session(s) to be re-activated' but there is pending downlink UP data or signalling, the AMF may still initiate the procedure. Upon receiving the NAS message, if the AMF does not require a NAS Security Mode Command (SMC) before initiating the NGAP procedure INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP, it derives the key KgNB/KeNB using the uplink NAS COUNT corresponding to the NAS message that transitioned the UE from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED state and the KAMF of the current 5G NAS security context. The AMF then communicates the KgNB/KeNB to the serving gNB/ng-eNB during the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP procedure. The UE also derives the KgNB/KeNB from the KAMF of the current 5G NAS security context using the same NAS uplink COUNT.

As a result of the NAS Service Request or Registration procedure with 'PDU session(s) to be re-activated,' radio bearers are established, and the gNB/ng-eNB sends an AS SMC to the UE. If the UE receives the AS SMC without a prior NAS SMC, it uses the NAS uplink COUNT from the NAS message that transitioned it from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED state as the freshness parameter for deriving KgNB/KeNB. The Key Derivation Function (KDF) specified in Annex A is used for this derivation. From KgNB/KeNB, the UE and gNB/ng-eNB derive the RRC protection keys and UP protection keys.

If the NAS procedure includes a primary authentication run, the NAS uplink and downlink COUNT for the new KAMF are set to zero. If it includes a NAS SMC, the uplink NAS COUNT from the most recent NAS Security Mode Complete is used as the freshness parameter for deriving KgNB/KeNB from the fresh KAMF during an AS SMC.

For Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimization, when the UE sends data over NAS and N3 bearers are established, the UE and AMF use the uplink NAS COUNT from the Control Plane Service Request that transitioned the UE from idle to active as the freshness parameter for deriving KeNB, unless there has been a subsequent NAS Security Mode Complete. In that case, the uplink NAS COUNT from the latest NAS Security Mode Complete message is used.","The answer should cover the initiation of the procedure by NAS Service Request or Registration Request, the derivation of KgNB/KeNB using NAS uplink COUNT and KAMF, the communication of keys to gNB/ng-eNB, the handling of AS SMC, and the specific steps for Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimization. It should also include the derivation of RRC protection keys and UP protection keys from KgNB/KeNB."
"Describe the configuration and activation mechanisms for Incoming Communication Barring (ICB), Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB), and Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) services.","The Incoming Communication Barring (ICB) service allows users to bar certain categories of incoming communications based on a provisioned or user-configured barring program. This program consists of rules with conditional and action parts, such as barring communications from anonymous users or specific public user identities. The Inhibition of Incoming Forwarded Calls is a special case of ICB, enabling users to reject communications diverted to them by other users. The Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service, another special case of ICB, allows users to reject incoming communications from anonymous sources, which is often a regulatory requirement.

The Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) service enables users to bar certain categories of outgoing communications based on similar rule-based programs. Both ICB and OCB services can be configured over the Ut interface using XCAP or SIP-based user configuration protocols. If the subscription option for barring services control is set to 'by subscriber using a password,' the subscriber must provide a password for configuration. If set to 'by the service provider,' the service provider handles the configuration, and any subscriber attempts to manipulate the service will be rejected.

Activation and deactivation of ICB, OCB, and ACR services can be performed at provisioning or upon the subscriber's request using the specified mechanisms. ACR is identified as a supplementary service and matches corresponding PSTN/ISDN and CS services. It is authorized and activated as part of the ICB service, with specific information elements and service authorization procedures.","The answer should cover the following key points:

Describe the requirements and setup for conducting Codec Quality Characterization Tests as specified in 3GPP TS 26.259.,"The Codec Quality Characterization Test, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.259, assesses the Basic Audio Quality attribute at different bit-rates for a given audio profile. The test setup includes one Hidden Reference and two Anchors, which are 3.5kHz and 7kHz low-pass filtered versions of the Reference condition. 

For tests involving loudspeakers, the Reference and Hidden Reference conditions are rendered to the loudspeaker setup through the Reference Renderer of the audio profile under test, with the coding bypassed. It is important to note that the Reference Renderer may introduce degradations to the immersive audio quality, including a reduction in the number of audio streams, which should be carefully considered when evaluating the results.

For tests involving headphones, the Reference and Hidden Reference conditions are binaurally rendered to headphones through the Common Informative Binaural Renderer (CIBR). This setup ensures that the test materials are accurately presented in a binaural format, allowing for a thorough assessment of audio quality in headphone listening scenarios.","The answer should detail the Codec Quality Characterization Test setup, including the requirement for one Hidden Reference and two Anchors (3.5kHz and 7kHz low-pass filtered versions of the Reference condition).

These servers can perform two primary operations: Data Pull and Data Update.

The Data Pull operation, detailed in clause 6.2.1, allows the MC Service Server or the Configuration Management Server to request specific data elements from the MC Service User Database. This operation can also include a subscription to notifications for changes to specific data elements, indicated by the 'Subscription to notifications' flag in the DPR-Flags.

The Data Update operation, described in clause 6.2.2, enables the Configuration Management Server to update data elements in the MC Service User Database.

To manage these operations, the MC Service User Database maintains a 'Requesting Entity Permissions List,' which identifies the permissions associated with each requested data element for both Data Pull and Data Update operations. These permissions are defined for all MC Service Users served by the database. If a server does not have the required permission, the database will return an error result.

The types of data accessible via different interfaces are defined in tables 6.3-1, 6.3-2, and 6.3-3.

"Describe the structure and components of a URI in the context of 3GPP Service Based Interfaces (SBI) APIs, including specific examples and references to relevant 3GPP documents.","The structure of a URI in the context of 3GPP Service Based Interfaces (SBI) APIs is defined to ensure consistent and clear identification of resources. The URI structure is composed of several key components: {apiRoot}, {apiName}, <apiVersion>, and <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>.

The {apiRoot} is a concatenation of the scheme (either 'http' or 'https'), a fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port), and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character. The authority is typically represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

The {apiName} defines the name of the API, such as 'nsmf-pdusession' or 'nudm-ueau'. The <apiVersion> indicates the major version of the API, formatted as 'v1', 'v2', etc.

The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> is a part of the URI that specifies the resource relative to the API URI. This part is detailed in specific clauses of the 3GPP documents.

An example of an API URI is '{apiRoot}/nsmf-pdusession/v1', where 'nsmf-pdusession' is the apiName and 'v1' is the apiVersion. Another example is '{apiRoot}/nudm-ueau/v1'.

"Compare the noise level measurement procedures described in TS 26.132 clauses 8.3.1, 8.3.2, 8.3.3, and 8.3.4, highlighting any differences in the measurement setup and analysis.","The noise level measurement procedures described in TS 26.132 clauses 8.3.1, 8.3.2, 8.3.3, and 8.3.4 share several common steps and procedures, but also have specific differences in their measurement setups and analysis.

Common Steps and Procedures:
1. All clauses require following the general steps listed in clause 8.3.0 before the measurement.
2. An optional activation sequence may be used in advance to the noise level measurement.
3. The noise measurement duration is consistent across all clauses, being 170,667 ms, which equals 8192 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system.
4. The spectral distribution of the noise is analyzed using an 8k FFT with windowing that has ≤ 0.1 dB leakage for non bin-centered signals, achieved with a flat top window.
5. The total noise powers obtained from repeats are averaged, and the result is expressed as 10 * log10 of this average in dB.
6. The single frequency maximum powers obtained from repeats are averaged, and the result is expressed as 10 * log10 of this average in dB.

Specific Differences:
1. Clause 8.3.1 measures the noise level at the output of the SS (Sound Source) with A-weighting. The A-weighting filter is described in IEC 61672.
2. Clause 8.3.2 measures the noise with A-weighting at the DRP (Device Reference Point) with diffuse-field correction. The A-weighting filter is also described in IEC 61672.
3. Clause 8.3.3 uses the same method as clause 8.3.1, indicating no additional differences.
4. Clause 8.3.4 also uses the same method as clause 8.3.1, but the idle noise signal is captured at the receive output of the electrical reference interface.

Describe the test procedure for verifying UE's event reporting when configured with highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17 according to 3GPP TS 38.533.,"The test procedure for verifying UE's event reporting when configured with highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17 according to 3GPP TS 38.533 involves several key steps and conditions. 

Firstly, the purpose of this test is to ensure that the UE correctly reports an event when configured with highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17, partly verifying the SA inter-frequency NR cell search requirements. This test is applicable to all types of E-UTRA UE release 16 and forward that support enhanced inter-frequency NR measurement requirements in high-speed scenarios.

The initial conditions for the test require the test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) to be configured according to specific parameters. There are two NR cells on different carriers involved in the test: Cell 1 for connection setup and Cell 2 as the target cell. The power levels and settings for Cell 2 are defined in Annex C.1.2.

The test procedure includes the following steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters Connectivity NR SA, Connected without release On, and Test Mode On.
2. Set the parameters according to the initial conditions.
3. The Serving System (SS) transmits an RRCReconfiguration message.
4. The UE responds with an RRCReconfigurationComplete message, starting time period T1.
5. When T1 expires, the SS switches the power setting to T2. During T2, the UE should transmit a MeasurementReport message triggered by Event A3. The reporting delay must be less than 2240 ms.
6. After receiving the MeasurementReport or when T2 expires, the SS either releases the RRC connection or switches off the UE.
7. The physical cell identity of Cell 3 is updated for the next iteration.
8. Depending on the previous step, the SS either transmits a Paging message to re-establish the RRC connection or switches the UE back on.
9. Repeat steps 2-8 until the confidence level is achieved.
10. Repeat the entire procedure for each sub-test as appropriate.

Message contents for this test are defined with specific exceptions, ensuring accurate reporting without SSB time index detection in non-DRX scenarios.

The test requirements specify that the UE must send one Event A3 triggered measurement report within the defined delay. The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%.

Overall, this detailed procedure ensures that the UE's event reporting capabilities are thoroughly verified under high-speed inter-frequency measurement conditions.","The answer must include the purpose of the test, the types of UE it applies to, the initial conditions and configurations required, the detailed steps of the test procedure including the timing and message exchanges, the specific message contents and exceptions, and the test requirements including the criteria for successful event reporting and the confidence level required."
"Explain the procedures and requirements for DTMF tone detection and reporting in 3GPP networks, referencing the relevant 3GPP technical specifications.","In 3GPP networks, the detection and reporting of DTMF tones involve several procedures and requirements as outlined in various technical specifications.

The Media Gateway (MGW) plays a crucial role in detecting and reporting DTMF tones. The MGW uses the Detect DTMF procedure to identify DTMF tones and reports the detected digits to the (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF using the Report DTMF procedure. Upon receiving the DTMF tone report, the (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF can either instruct the MGW to continue detecting other DTMF tones or request it to stop the detection using the Stop DTMF Detection procedure. These procedures are detailed in TS 23.205, clause 14.4.2.1.

DTMF tone detection within the PCM speech codec is required by applications that utilize DTMF information within the (G)MSC server, particularly when the RTP telephony event is not negotiated with the SDP offer/answer. In such cases, the server controlling the MGW requests inband DTMF detection by applying the Detect DTMF procedure without configuring the RTP Telephony Event payload at the corresponding termination, as specified in TS 23.231, clause 14.4.7.

For interworking scenarios between SIP-I and BICC networks, if the RTP Telephony Event has been selected for the 3GPP SIP-I CS CN interface and Out-of-Band (OoB) DTMF transmission is required in the succeeding BICC network, the Interworking Unit (IWU) uses the Detect DTMF procedure to request the MGW to report DTMF digits. This is described in TS 29.235, clause 6.7.2, which also provides examples of explicit and implicit duration reporting in BICC. If the RTP Telephony Event has not been selected, the IWU requests inband DTMF detection as described in TS 23.205, clause 14.4.2.1.

In summary, the procedures for DTMF tone detection and reporting in 3GPP networks involve the Detect DTMF, Report DTMF, and Stop DTMF Detection procedures, the conditions for DTMF tone detection within PCM speech codec, the use and configuration of RTP Telephony Event, and interworking scenarios between SIP-I and BICC networks.

"Describe the key resource efficiency improvements introduced by 5G as outlined in the 3GPP TS 22.261 documents, including aspects related to network operation, UE configuration, and security.","The 3GPP TS 22.261 documents outline several key resource efficiency improvements introduced by 5G. These improvements are designed to optimize the system for supporting diverse UEs and services, enhancing overall network performance and efficiency.

Firstly, 5G introduces enhancements in network operation and UE configuration. This includes bulk provisioning, which allows for efficient resource allocation to multiple UEs simultaneously. Resource efficient access is another improvement, ensuring that UEs can connect to the network using minimal resources. Optimization for UE originated data transfer is also highlighted, reducing the overhead associated with data transmission from UEs. Additionally, 5G addresses the reduced needs related to mobility management for stationary UEs and UEs with restricted movement, further conserving resources.

Support for small data bursts is a significant improvement, allowing the network to operate without lengthy and high overhead signalling procedures before and after small amounts of data are sent. This not only conserves signalling resources but also positively impacts battery life for UEs. For small form factor UEs, which may only have one antenna due to size constraints, 5G ensures that these UEs can still meet expected performance standards.

Cloud applications, such as cloud robotics, benefit from 5G's high data rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. This optimization is crucial for scenarios involving high-density cloud robotics, where resource efficiency is paramount.

Control plane resource efficiencies are achieved by minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small data transmissions. User plane resource efficiencies include mechanisms like in-network caching and application hosting closer to the end user, contributing to lower latency and higher reliability.

Security-related resource efficiencies are also addressed in 5G. The system minimizes security signalling overhead without compromising the security level. Additionally, 5G supports efficient secure mechanisms for transmitting the same data to multiple UEs, such as service provisioning for multiple sensors.

Overall, these resource efficiency improvements in 5G enhance network performance, reduce resource consumption, and support a wide range of applications and services.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Overview of resource efficiency improvements in 5G.
  - Specific improvements for diverse UEs and services, including bulk provisioning, resource efficient access, optimization for UE originated data transfer, reduced mobility management needs, support for small data bursts, single antenna performance for small form factor UEs, and cloud applications.

"How do RTTI and VSRB schemes compare in terms of delay improvements, bandwidth efficiency, and compatibility with legacy systems as described in TS 45.912?","RTTI (Reduced Transmission Time Interval) and VSRB (Variable Size Radio Block) schemes offer different advantages and trade-offs in terms of delay improvements, bandwidth efficiency, and compatibility with legacy systems.

RTTI is designed to reduce latency without compromising bandwidth efficiency. It achieves this by defining new multislot or multi-carrier channels, which are not compatible with legacy mobile devices, necessitating resource segregation. This means that while RTTI can significantly reduce latency, it requires new channel definitions and cannot be used with older devices.

On the other hand, VSRB is fully backward-compatible as it utilizes existing allocation schemes and does not require new channel definitions or resource segregation. VSRB can provide similar, if not better, latency improvements compared to RTTI, especially in certain ranges. For instance, Figure 343 shows that both RTTI and VSRB offer comparable delay improvements, although there are specific ranges where VSRB performs better than RTTI and vice versa. Figure 344 further illustrates the delay over the radio interface for VSRB when restricted to 4-burst or 2-burst blocks.

Additionally, detailed simulation results in Annex E of TS 45.912 highlight the impact of different radio block formats on delay for RTTI. These formats include one timeslot in each of four consecutive TDMA frames, two consecutive timeslots in each of two consecutive TDMA frames, and four consecutive timeslots in one TDMA frame. The results show that RTTI can effectively reduce latency across various formats, but the need for new channel definitions remains a significant consideration.

In summary, while RTTI offers reduced latency and maintains bandwidth efficiency, it requires new channel definitions and is not compatible with legacy systems. VSRB, however, provides similar latency improvements without the need for new channels, making it fully backward-compatible and suitable for use with existing devices.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The definition and benefits of RTTI, including its impact on latency and bandwidth efficiency.
  - The comparison between RTTI and VSRB in terms of delay improvements, highlighting the ranges where each scheme performs better.
  - The compatibility of RTTI and VSRB with legacy systems, including the need for new channel definitions and resource segregation for RTTI versus the backward compatibility of VSRB.
  - Reference to the figures (343 and 344) that illustrate the delay over the radio interface for different allocation schemes.
  - Summary of the simulation results for RTTI, including the different radio block formats and their impact on delay."
"What are the requirements for UE to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell when no DRX is in use, according to 3GPP specifications?","When no DRX is in use, the UE must be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within 1000 ms. The minimum time available for intra-frequency measurements, referred to as TIntra, is the time during which the receiver is guaranteed to be active on the intra-frequency carrier. A cell is considered detectable when the RSRP and RSRQ related side conditions specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 9.1.2.5, 9.1.2.6, and 9.1.5.3 are fulfilled for the corresponding band, and the SCH_RP and SCH Ês/Iot conditions according to Annex I.2.8 are met.

In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurement period for intra-frequency measurements is 200 ms. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements for 8 identified intra-frequency cells, including cells not measured in subframes indicated by the time-domain measurement resource restriction pattern and cells indicated in the CRS assistance information. The UE physical layer must report measurements to higher layers within the 200 ms measurement period. If measurement gaps are activated, the UE must perform measurements for at least Ymeasurement_intra_FeICIC cells, where Ymeasurement_intra_FeICIC is defined by the equation involving Xbasic_measurement_FDD_FeICIC or Xbasic_measurement_TDD_FeICIC, both set to 8 cells.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports unless reporting criteria are fulfilled. The measurement reporting delay is the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling on the DCCH and uncertainties from inserting the report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The event-triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering, must be less than Tidentify_intra_FeICIC. Additional delays can be expected if L3 filtering is used or IDC autonomous denial is configured.

If a cell detectable for at least the time period Tidentify_intra_FeICIC becomes undetectable for ≤ 5 seconds and then detectable again, triggering an event, the event-triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than TMeasurement_Period_FeICIC, Intra, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±50 Ts and L3 filtering has not been used. Additional delays can be expected with L3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial.","The answer must include the identification time (1000 ms), the minimum time available for intra-frequency measurements (TIntra), the conditions for a cell to be considered detectable (RSRP, RSRQ, SCH_RP, SCH Ês/Iot), the measurement period (200 ms), the number of cells (8), the definition of measurement reporting delay, the event triggered measurement reporting delay, and the potential additional delays due to L3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial."

3. The Server NWDAF aggregates all local training results to derive the aggregated Abnormal Classifier information.
4. The Server NWDAF sends the aggregated Abnormal Classifier information back to Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2, which then update their own Abnormal Classifiers based on this information.

This iterative process continues until the training termination condition, such as the maximum number of iterations, is fulfilled. After the training procedure is completed, the globally optimal Abnormal Classifier or its parameters can be distributed to Client NWDAF 1, Client NWDAF 2, and any new Client NWDAFs for inference.","The answer must include:

What are the coding schemes and their applications for various channels as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003?,"The coding schemes for various channels as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003 are detailed as follows:

1. **PACCH, PBCCH, PAGCH, PPCH, downlink PTCCH, CPBCCH, CPAGCH, CPPCH**: These channels use the same coding scheme as CS-1, as specified in subclause 5.1.1. In RTTI configuration, the downlink PACCH may use the coding scheme defined for MCS-0 in subclause 5.1.4a. In DLMC configuration, the uplink PACCH may use the coding scheme defined for CS-3 in subclause 5.1.3. The uplink PTCCH uses the same coding scheme as PRACH, specified in subclause 5.3.

2. **Downlink PACCH including eTFI field**: The message delivered to the encoder has a fixed size of 187 information bits. The first 184 bits are protected by 40 parity bits, and bit-wise modulo 2 addition is performed using a subset of the parity bits, dependent on the state of the three bits representing the assigned eTFI value.

4. **Encoding of bursts for PRACH**: The encoding follows the definition in subclause 5.3. The BSIC used is the BSIC of the BTS to which the burst is intended. An MS in EC operation sending a block on EC-PACCH/U as four access bursts uses blind physical layer transmissions according to the assigned UL Coverage Class, as described in subclause 5.2b.

5. **Reordering, partitioning, and sorting of encoded bits for various speech channels**: Detailed tables are provided for the reordering and partitioning of coded blocks into sub-blocks, subjective importance of encoded bits for full rate and half rate speech TCH, and sorting of speech encoded bits for various speech channels.

"Describe the procedures for storing MCData communications in the MCData message store, including both outgoing and incoming communications, as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.282.","The procedures for storing MCData communications in the MCData message store, as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.282, are limited to a single MCData system according to subclause 7.4.2.

For outgoing communications, the process begins when an MCData user requests to store their communications in the MCData message store. The user must have an account created with the MCData message store, and the configuration to store communications must be enabled. The detailed procedure is as follows:
1. The MCData client initiates an MCData SDS service request, which can be either a private or group communication.
2. The MCData server stores the communication as an object in the user's account in the MCData message store.
3. The MCData server checks and authorizes the service request and continues the service request toward the targeted recipient(s) as described in subclause 7.4.2.

For incoming communications, the process also begins with the user's request to store their communications in the MCData message store. Similar to outgoing communications, the user must have an account created with the MCData message store, and the configuration to store communications must be enabled. The detailed procedure is as follows:
1. The MCData server receives an incoming MCData SDS service request for the user. This request can be a response to an earlier service request sent by the user or a new service request from any sender.
2. The MCData server stores the communication as an object in the user's account in the MCData message store.

"Describe the process of GA-PSR Transport Channel activation and deactivation in GAN A/Gb mode, including the states involved and the message sequences.","The GA-PSR sub-layer in the mobile station (MS) can be in two states: GA-PSR-STANDBY and GA-PSR-ACTIVE. Initially, the MS is in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state, where it cannot send or receive GPRS user data to and from the GAN Controller (GANC). The GA-PSR Transport Channel does not exist in this state. The MS transitions to the GA-PSR-ACTIVE state upon successful establishment of the GA-PSR Transport Channel, allowing the MS to send and receive GPRS user data.

GA-PSR Transport Channel (TC) activation can be triggered by either the MS or the GANC. The MS may initiate activation when it needs to transfer uplink data using LLC SAPI 3, 5, 9, or 11. Alternatively, the GANC can initiate activation by sending a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the MS, which includes the GANC IP address and UDP port number assigned to the GA-PSR TC. The MS responds with a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC ACK message, confirming the selected UDP port number and transitioning to the GA-PSR-ACTIVE state. The MS then starts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.

During data transfer, the MS encapsulates uplink LLC-PDUs within GA-PSR UNITDATA messages and forwards them to the GANC, which then sends them to the Core Network. Downlink LLC-PDUs are sent from the Core Network to the GANC, which forwards them to the MS using GA-PSR UNITDATA messages. The GA-PSR Channel Timer is restarted whenever any uplink or downlink user data packet is sent or received.

Deactivation of the GA-PSR TC occurs when the GA-PSR Channel Timer expires or when a PS handover from GAN A/Gb mode to GERAN/UTRAN mode is successfully completed. The MS sends a GA-PSR DEACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the GANC, indicating normal deactivation. The GANC deletes the related MS information and replies with a GA-PSR DEACTIVATE UTC ACK message, upon which the MS transitions back to the GA-PSR-STANDBY state.

In summary, the GA-PSR Transport Channel activation and deactivation involve specific message sequences between the MS and GANC, with the GA-PSR Channel Timer playing a crucial role in managing the state transitions and ensuring proper data transport via GAN.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The initial state of the GA-PSR sub-layer (GA-PSR-STANDBY) and the conditions under which it transitions to GA-PSR-ACTIVE.

"Describe the procedures and information elements involved in routing short messages in 3GPP networks, referencing the relevant technical specifications.","The procedures for routing short messages in 3GPP networks involve several key entities and steps. The SMS-GMSC (Short Message Service Gateway Mobile Switching Center) or the IP-SM-GW (IP Short Message Gateway) interacts with the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) to retrieve the necessary routing information for delivering the short message to the serving MSC (Mobile Switching Center), MME (Mobility Management Entity), SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), or SMSF (Short Message Service Function). This procedure is also applicable when the SMS-GMSC communicates with the SMS Router or the IP-SM-GW, and when the HSS interacts with the SMS Router or the IP-SM-GW to enforce routing of the short message delivery via the HPLMN (Home Public Land Mobile Network) of the receiving mobile station (MS). The procedure utilizes the S6c interface for the SMS Router function of the IP-SM-GW.

The procedure is mapped to the Diameter commands Send-Routing-Info-for-SM-Request (SRR) and Send-Routing-Info-for-SM-Answer (SRA), which are specified in the Diameter application. The involved information elements for the request and answer are detailed in tables 5.2.1.1-1 and 5.2.1.1-2 respectively.

Additionally, the fundamental procedures for SMS include:
1. Short message mobile terminated: This involves transferring a short message or status report from the Service Center (SC) to the MS and returning a report to the SC with the result of the message transfer attempt.
2. Short message mobile originated: This involves transferring a short message from the MS to the SC and returning a report to the MS with the result of the message transfer attempt.
3. Transfer of an Alert: This involves the HLR (Home Location Register) or VLR (Visitor Location Register) initiating a transfer of an alert to a specific SC, informing the SC that the MS has recovered operation.

The operations necessary for the provision of SMS are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002, which outlines the requirements that SMS imposes on network functionality. If there are discrepancies in nomenclature, TS 29.002 serves as the reference. The flow of primitives and parameters during short message transfer between the SC and the MS, covering both terminated and originated cases, is indicated in Annex C of TS 23.040.","The answer must include a detailed description of the procedures for routing short messages, including the entities involved and their roles. It should explain the use of the S6c interface and the mapping to Diameter commands.

Explain the methods for MCX user service authorization using SIP messages as described in 3GPP TS 33.180.,"MCX user service authorization can be performed using two types of SIP messages: SIP REGISTER and SIP PUBLISH, as described in 3GPP TS 33.180.

1. **SIP REGISTER Message**:
   - During initial SIP registration, the SIP REGISTER message should not be delayed due to the absence of an access token. If an access token is not available, SIP registration proceeds without it, and the access token is transmitted later to the MCX server.
   - If an access token is available before SIP registration or if the UE becomes de-registered and requires re-registration, the SIP REGISTER message may include the access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
   - The process of using a SIP REGISTER message to provide the access token to the MCX server involves several steps:
     - The access token is passed to the SIP core in the SIP REGISTER message.
     - Upon successful SIP authentication, the SIP core forwards the access token to the MCX server in a third-party registration request message.
     - The MCX server receives the third-party registration request message, validates the access token, binds the IMPU and MC service ID (MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID, or MCData ID) if the access token is valid, and responds to the third-party registration message.

2. **SIP PUBLISH Message**:
   - The inclusion of an access token in any particular SIP PUBLISH message is optional.
   - The process of using a SIP PUBLISH message to provide the access token to the MCX server involves several steps:
     - The SIP PUBLISH message carries the access token through the SIP core to the MCX server.
     - The MCX server receives the SIP PUBLISH message, validates the access token, binds the IMPU and MC service ID (MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID, or MCData ID) if the access token is valid, and responds to the SIP PUBLISH message.

Additionally, the access token may be sent over SIP to the MCX server to re-bind an IMPU and MC service ID if either have changed, such as when the IMPU is different due to SIP deregistration/re-registration or when a user logs out and another user logs onto the same UE.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The two methods for MCX user service authorization: SIP REGISTER and SIP PUBLISH messages.
  - The process of initial SIP registration and handling of access tokens.
  - Detailed steps for using SIP REGISTER message for authorization, including the optional inclusion of access tokens and the validation process.
  - Detailed steps for using SIP PUBLISH message for authorization, including the optional inclusion of access tokens and the validation process.

What are the requirements and procedures for 'RTP-level pause and resume' signalling in IBCF and TrGW?,"The 'RTP-level pause and resume' signalling allows for the temporary suspension and subsequent resumption of RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) streams, which is useful in scenarios where media transmission needs to be paused without terminating the session. According to 3GPP TS 26.114 and IETF RFC 7728, this signalling mechanism is defined to ensure seamless media handling during interruptions.

If the Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF) and the Transition Gateway (TrGW) support 'RTP-level pause and resume' signalling, they must adhere to the requirements and procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.334. Specifically, subclause 524 and subclause 6.223 outline the necessary steps and conditions for implementing this feature. These include the proper handling of RTP packets during the pause and resume phases, ensuring synchronization between endpoints, and maintaining the integrity of the media session. The procedures also involve signaling messages that indicate the pause and resume actions, as well as any necessary adjustments to the RTP stream parameters to accommodate the pause duration.",The answer should include the definition of 'RTP-level pause and resume' signalling according to 3GPP TS 26.114 and IETF RFC 7728.

Compare the event triggered reporting requirements for serving cell under fading propagation conditions across different E-UTRAN configurations.,"The event triggered reporting requirements for serving cell under fading propagation conditions vary across different E-UTRAN configurations, namely FDD-FDD, HD-FDD, and TDD-TDD. 

For E-UTRAN FDD-FDD configuration, the primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Table 8.3.12.4.1-1. The cell specific test parameters are detailed in Table 8.3.12.5-1. The UE is required to send one Event A3 triggered measurement report with a measurement reporting delay of less than 819.2 seconds from the beginning of time period T2, derived from clause 8.13.3.5. The UE should not send event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are met. The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%. The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTIDCCH higher than the specified measurement reporting delays due to TTI insertion uncertainty in the DCCH.

For E-UTRAN HD-FDD configuration, the primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Table 8.3.15.4.1-1. The cell specific test parameters are detailed in Table 8.3.15.5-1. Similar to the FDD-FDD configuration, the UE must send one Event A3 triggered measurement report with a measurement reporting delay of less than 819.2 seconds from the beginning of time period T2, derived from clause 8.13.3.5. The UE should not send event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are met. The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%. However, the actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB x TTIDCCH higher than the specified measurement reporting delays due to TTI insertion uncertainty in the DCCH, where pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB is the maximum number of PUSCH repetitions configured.

For E-UTRAN TDD-TDD configuration, the primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Table 8.4.13.5-1. The cell specific test parameters are detailed in the same table. The UE must send one Event A3 triggered measurement report with a measurement reporting delay of less than 819.2 seconds from the beginning of time period T2, derived from clause 8.13.3.5. The UE should not send event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are met. The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%. Similar to the HD-FDD configuration, the actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB x TTIDCCH higher than the specified measurement reporting delays due to TTI insertion uncertainty in the DCCH, where pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB is the maximum number of PUSCH repetitions configured.

In summary, while the measurement reporting delay, rate of correct events, and confidence level are consistent across all configurations, the specific parameters affecting the overall delays, such as TTI insertion uncertainty and pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB, vary between FDD-FDD, HD-FDD, and TDD-TDD configurations.","The answer should include a comparison of the primary level settings and test tolerances for each E-UTRAN configuration (FDD-FDD, HD-FDD, TDD-TDD). It should detail the cell specific test parameters, the measurement reporting delay requirements, the rate of correct events, and the confidence level for each configuration. Additionally, it should address the TTI insertion uncertainty and any specific parameters such as pusch-maxNumRepetitionCEmodeB that affect the overall delays measured in the tests."
"Describe the PFCP Association Update procedure, including the roles and responsibilities of the CP and UP functions, and the impact of the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR).","The PFCP Association Update procedure involves both the Control Plane (CP) function and the User Plane (UP) function, each with specific roles and responsibilities. 

The CP function initiates the PFCP Association Update procedure to report changes to the PFCP association to the UP function, such as updating supported features. When both functions support the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR), the CP function may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the 'PFCP Association Release Preparation Start' flag set to '1' to request the UP function to report all non-zero usage reports for the PFCP sessions affected by the release of the PFCP association.

Upon receiving a PFCP Association Update Request, the UP function must update the list of optional features of the CP function, send a PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error cause if the Node ID is unknown, or return a successful cause value if the request is handled successfully. If the EPFAR feature is supported and the 'PFCP Association Release Preparation' flag is set to '1', the UP function must send the PFCP Association Update Response with a successful cause value and then send PFCP Session Report Request messages to report non-zero usage reports for the affected PFCP sessions.

The UP function can also initiate the PFCP Association Update procedure to report changes to the PFCP association to the CP function, such as changes in optional features or UE IP Address Pool Identifiers. If the EPFAR feature is supported, the UP function may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the 'PFCP Association Release Preparation' flag set to '1' to inform the CP function that all non-zero usage reports for the affected PFCP sessions will be reported. The UP function must then send a PFCP Association Update Request with the URSS flag set to '1' once all non-zero usage reports have been sent.

When receiving a PFCP Association Update Request from the UP function, the CP function must update the list of optional features of the UP function, send a PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error cause if the Node ID is unknown, or return a successful cause value if the request is handled successfully. If the UP function has requested to release the PFCP association, the CP function should initiate a PFCP Association Release Request as soon as possible or before the expiry of the Graceful Release Period. The CP function should stop creating new PFCP sessions in the UP function during this period and may initiate a PFCP Session Deletion Procedure to collect usage reports before the Graceful Release Period expires.

The UP function initiates the PFCP Session Report procedure to report information related to a PFCP session to the CP function. If the EPFAR feature is supported, the UP function may send a PFCP Session Report Request with the PSDBU flag set to '1' to report remaining non-zero usage reports before the PFCP session is locally deleted. Upon receiving a PFCP Session Report Response with a success cause, the UP function considers the information successfully delivered.

Overall, the EPFAR feature impacts the PFCP Association Update procedure by introducing specific flags and requirements for handling non-zero usage reports during the release of the PFCP association, ensuring that both CP and UP functions coordinate effectively to manage the association and session reports.","The answer should include:
- The initiation of the PFCP Association Update procedure by both CP and UP functions.
- The roles and responsibilities of the CP and UP functions during the PFCP Association Update procedure.

- The handling of non-zero usage reports during the release of the PFCP association.
- The conditions under which the PFCP Association Release Request is initiated by the CP function.
- The process of reporting information related to PFCP sessions during the Enhanced PFCP Association Release procedure."
Describe the requirements and specifications for TLS support and certificate profiles in 3GPP documents TS 33.246 and TS 33.310.,"The requirements for TLS support and certificate profiles in 3GPP documents TS 33.246 and TS 33.310 are as follows:

According to TS 33.246, the User Equipment (UE) must support TLS in accordance with the TLS profile specified in TS 33.310, Annex E. The certificates used must comply with the requirements for TLS certificates outlined in clause 6.1 of TS 33.310. When the UE opts to use TLS, it is mandatory to use a TLS ciphersuite that does not include NULL encryption. Support for certificate revocation and related fields in certificates is optional, but if supported, the certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) profiles in clauses 6.1 and 6.1a of TS 33.310 should be followed.

TS 33.310 provides the general 3GPP certificate profile, which is referenced by other 3GPP specifications. The certificate profiling requirements in TS 33.310 must be applied in addition to those in RFC5280, with 3GPP requirements taking precedence in case of conflicts. Entities such as the Security Gateway (SEG), Network Elements (NE), and TLS entities must be able to process extensions marked as critical and ensure compliance with the NDS/AF profiles. Certificate Authorities (CAs) must verify that certificate signing requests conform to the defined profiles and check the consistency of the Subject's DirectoryString order within their administrative domain. NEs, SEGs, and TLS entities must only accept certificates that comply with the NDS/AF profiles.","The answer should include the mandatory support for TLS according to the profile in TS 33.310, Annex E, and the compliance of certificates with the requirements in clause 6.1 of TS 33.310.

What are the physical layer requirements for the Gb interface as specified in 3GPP TS 48.014?,"The physical layer of the Gb interface must conform to specific clauses of FRF 1.2. This does not mean that each BSS and SGSN equipment has to support all of these physical interfaces, but rather that the supported physical interfaces must comply with the corresponding clause of FRF 1.2. The supported physical interfaces and their corresponding clauses are:
a) ANSI T1.403 (clause 2.1.1)
b) V.35, physical circuit and DTE/DCE interface clauses (clause 2.1.2)
c) G.703 (clause 2.1.3)
d) G.704 (clause 2.1.4)
e) X.21 (clause 2.1.5)
f) TIA/EIA-530-A (clause 2.1.6)
g) HSSI (clause 2.1.7)

The Gb interface may be multiplexed with the A interface on the same E1 (2 048 kbit/s) or T1 (1 544 kbit/s) digital path. For the E1 interface, ITU-T Recommendation G.704 should be applied according to FRF 1.2 and 3GPP TS 48.004 as appropriate. For the T1 interface, ANSI T1.403 should be applied according to FRF 1.1 and 3GPP TS 48.004 as appropriate.

When multiple 64 kbit/s channels are used on an E1 (2 048 kbit/s) digital path on the Gb interface, it is recommended to aggregate them into one nx64 kbit/s channel, as per ITU-T Recommendation G.704, clause 5 and included clauses. Similarly, when multiple 64 kbit/s channels are used on a T1 (1 544 kbit/s) digital path on the Gb interface, it is recommended to aggregate them into an nx64 kbit/s (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24) channel, as per Bellcore TR-NWT-1203. This approach optimizes the use of the available bandwidth by taking advantage of statistical multiplexing at the upper layer. However, it requires that no slipping occurs between individual 64 kbit/s channels, especially when passing through intermediate equipment between BSS and SGSN.","The answer must include:

Explain the process of selecting the coding mode (MDCT or GSC) for music signals at 13.2kbps.,"The process of selecting the coding mode (MDCT or GSC) for music signals at 13.2kbps involves several steps and criteria based on the analysis of signal spectral sparseness and linear prediction efficiency. Initially, the coding of music signals benefits from combining the advantages of MDCT and GSC technologies. For frames classified as music, the coding mode producing better quality is selected between MDCT and GSC based on an analysis of signal spectral sparseness and linear prediction efficiency, which depends on the input bandwidth.

For each active frame, the sum of the log energy spectrum is calculated to determine the spectral sparseness analysis. The log energy spectrum is then sorted in descending order of magnitude, and each element in the sorted log energy spectrum is accumulated one by one until the accumulated value exceeds 75% of the total. The index of the last element added into the accumulation represents the spectral sparseness of the frame and is stored into a sparseness buffer of 8 frames.

If the input bandwidth is WB (Wideband), several parameters dedicated to WB are calculated, including the mean of the sparseness buffer, the long-term smoothed sparseness, the high-band log energy sum, the high-band high sparseness flag, the low-band high sparseness flag, the linear prediction efficiency, and the voicing metric. For other input bandwidths, these parameters are not calculated.

The mean of the sparseness buffer is obtained, and the long-term smoothed sparseness is calculated using the average of the four smallest values in the sparseness buffer to reduce the possible negative impact from interfering frames. The high-band log energy sum is calculated, and the high-band high sparseness flag is determined by sorting the high-band log energy spectrum in descending order and calculating the ratio of the sum of the first 5 elements to the high-band log energy sum. If the mean of the buffer is greater than 0.2, the high-band high sparseness flag is set to 1, indicating high sparseness of the high-band spectrum.

Similarly, the low-band high sparseness flag is determined by sorting the low-band log energy spectrum and calculating the ratio of the sum of the first 5 elements to the low-band log energy sum. If the ratio is greater than 0.18, the low-band high sparseness flag is set to 1. The LP residual log-energy ratio of the current frame is stored into a buffer of 8 frames, and the mean of the buffer is used to represent the short-term linear prediction efficiency. The scaled normalized correlation is stored into a voicing buffer of 8 frames, and the mean of the buffer is used to represent the voicing metric.

The decision on which coding mode to use (MDCT or GSC) is made for each frame previously classified as music. GSC coding mode is selected for frames with extremely non-sparse spectrum when the sparseness index is greater than 90, and the GSC hangover flag is set to 1. If the frame is in a soft hangover period, GSC coding mode is selected if the sparseness index is greater than 85 or if the LP residual log-energy ratio deviates from the average of adjacent GSC coded frames by less than 7.

For WB input bandwidth, an additional step is applied. GSC coding mode is selected if various sparseness measures do not exhibit strong sparseness characteristics and the linear prediction efficiency is assumed high. Specifically, GSC coding mode is selected if the high-band high sparseness flag is set to 0, the low-band high sparseness flag is set to 0, and the LP residual log-energy ratio is low. If these conditions are not met but the GSC hangover flag is not set to 1, GSC coding mode is still selected.

"Describe the process and conditions under which an MCVideo client sends a location report in response to a SIP MESSAGE request, including the handling of triggers and timers.","The MCVideo client sends a location report in response to a SIP MESSAGE request under specific conditions and follows a detailed process for handling triggers and timers. 

1. **Conditions for Sending a Location Report:**
   - The MCVideo client must receive a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
     1. An Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to the value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcvideo'.
     2. A Content-Type header field set to 'application/vnd.3gpp.mcvideo-location-info+xml'.

Describe the process and criteria for retrieving records from the UDSF and LISSF as outlined in the 3GPP specifications.,"The process for retrieving records from the UDSF and LISSF involves several steps and criteria as outlined in the 3GPP specifications.

For retrieving a record from the UDSF:
1. The NF service consumer sends a GET request to the resource indicated by the recordId.
2. On success, the UDSF responds with a '200 OK' status and the message body containing the record.
3. If the record for the given recordId does not exist, the UDSF returns a '404 Not Found' status, optionally including additional error information in the response body (ProblemDetails element).
4. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with additional error information in the GET response body.

For searching records in the UDSF:
1. The NF service consumer sends a GET request to the Records resource with the filter query parameter indicating the search criteria.
2. The request may also include optional query parameters such as supported-features, limit-range, count-indicator, retrieve-records, max-payload-size, and filter containing a list of record IDs if the BulkOperations feature is supported.
3. On success, the UDSF responds with a '200 OK' status and the message body containing the RecordSearchResult.
4. If no records match the search criteria, the UDSF returns a '204 No Content' status.
5. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with additional error information in the GET response body.

For an LI function retrieving records from the LISSF:
1. If the LI function knows the RecordID, it performs a Record Retrieval operation as described in TS 29.598 clause 5.2.2.2.2.
2. If the LI function does not know the RecordID, it performs a search using appropriate search criteria as described in TS 29.598 clause 5.2.2.2.6.
3. The search criteria are specific to each LI function and detailed in later clauses specific to that LI function.

For the TF in an SMF set retrieving LI state information from the LISSF:
1. When provisioned by the LIPF with a specific XID and access to an LISSF function, the TF uses the LISSF to retrieve LI state information.
2. If active SM contexts are not always present in the SMF set, the TF requests records associated with the XID from the LISSF by performing a search using the XID as a search criteria.
3. If no records are found, the TF may assume no previous interception has occurred and proceed accordingly.
4. When the TF detects its parent SMF retrieving state for a targeted PDU session from the UDSF, it requests records associated with that PDU session from the LISSF using the UDSFRecordID as a search criteria.
5. When the TF detects its parent SMF receiving state for a targeted PDU session from another SMF, it requests records associated with that PDU session from the LISSF using the XID of the task related to the target of that PDU session.
6. If no records are found, the TF may assume no previous interception has occurred and proceed accordingly. Multiple records may be returned.

These processes ensure that records are retrieved efficiently and accurately based on the provided criteria and conditions.","The answer must include the detailed steps for retrieving records from the UDSF using a recordId and the associated HTTP responses, the steps for searching records in the UDSF using various query parameters and the associated HTTP responses, the process for an LI function to retrieve records from the LISSF using known RecordID or search criteria, and the process for the TF in an SMF set to retrieve LI state information from the LISSF using specific search criteria like XID or UDSFRecordID.

"What mechanisms are defined in TS 28.538 for ECS and EES performance assurance, and how are KPIs and measurements managed and reported?","TS 28.538 outlines mechanisms for both ECS (Enterprise Communication Services) and EES (Enterprise Edge Services) performance assurance. For ECS performance assurance, the goal is to provide a mechanism that allows for the collection and reporting of performance metrics based on various functionalities defined for ECS. These functionalities are detailed in clause 6.3.4. The measurement and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be defined for each functionality and collected as needed. The ECSP (Enterprise Communication Service Provider) Management system acts as a consumer, requesting the PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) management system to collect ECS KPIs and measurements. The PLMN management system, as the performance assurance MnS (Management Service) producer, then reports these measurements back to the ECSP Management system.

Similarly, for EES performance assurance, the mechanism involves defining and collecting KPIs and measurements based on functionalities outlined in clause 6.3.4. The ECSP Management system requests the PLMN management system to gather EES KPIs and measurements, and the PLMN management system reports these measurements to the consumer.

In summary, TS 28.538 provides a structured approach for performance assurance of ECS and EES by defining KPIs and measurements for specific functionalities, facilitating requests and consumption of performance data by the ECSP Management system, and ensuring the PLMN management system reports the collected data back to the consumer.","The answer should include the mechanisms for ECS and EES performance assurance as defined in TS 28.538, the process of defining and collecting KPIs and measurements, the role of the ECSP Management system in requesting and consuming performance assurance MnS, and the reporting process from the PLMN management system to the consumer.

Describe the measurement of RRC connection establishment attempts and its exclusions during AMF overload situations as defined in 3GPP specifications.,"The measurement of RRC connection establishment attempts is defined as the number of attempts to establish RRC connections for each establishment cause. This measurement is recorded upon the receipt of an RRCSetupRequest message by the gNB from the UE. However, certain RRCSetupRequest messages are excluded from this measurement: those received while a setup procedure is already ongoing for the same UE, and those received during AMF overload actions. The AMF overload situation, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501, involves the rejection of specific signalling traffic by the NG-RAN node to manage overload conditions. The identifier used for this measurement is RRC.ConnEstabAtt.Cause, where 'Cause' specifies the establishment cause. This measurement is crucial for performance assurance within the accessibility area, ensuring that the network can effectively manage connection attempts and maintain service quality.","The answer should include the definition of the measurement for RRC connection establishment attempts, the conditions under which RRCSetupRequest messages are excluded from the measurement, the identifier used for the measurement, and the usage of this measurement for performance assurance.

"What are the additional blocking requirements for a Base Station operating in the same geographical area as UTRA TDD, and what are the specific throughput and BER requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA TDD carriers?","The additional blocking requirements for a Base Station operating in the same geographical area as UTRA TDD are specified in TS 37.145. These requirements apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Maximum Radio Bandwidth, and the interfering signal is a 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD modulated signal. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Maximum Radio Bandwidth edges. For multi-band TAB connectors, the requirement also applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap if the gap size is at least 4.8 MHz.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the TAB connector, the following performance metrics must be met:

Describe the role and usage of the Connection Frame Number (CFN) in various control frames as defined in TS 25.427.,"The Connection Frame Number (CFN) plays a crucial role in various control frames within the context of TS 25.427. CFN is an indicator of the specific radio frame in which the first data was received on the uplink or transmitted on the downlink. For Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH), CFN indicates the radio frame when the Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) process correctly decoded the data. Apart from reordering purposes, CFN and Subframe number can be used for dynamic delay measurements, with a value range of 0-255 and a field length of 8 bits.

In the Downlink (DL) DATA FRAME, the CFN value is extracted from the corresponding frame, maintaining the same value range and field length. Similarly, CFN is used as the target CFN to calculate the Time of Arrival (ToA), ensuring accurate synchronization and timing.

The CFN value is also extracted from the DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame, which helps in maintaining synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, CFN indicates the frame when the RX timing deviation was measured, providing essential information for timing adjustments.

Finally, in the context of timing advance control frames, CFN specifies the frame in which the timing advance will occur, ensuring precise timing control for data transmission. Across all these usages, CFN consistently maintains a value range of 0-255 and a field length of 8 bits, ensuring uniformity and reliability in its application.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The definition and purpose of CFN in the context of E-DCH and dynamic delay measurements.

"What are the key functionalities and settings of the +CMEE parameter command as defined in 3GPP TS 27.007, and how do the error result codes operate?","The +CMEE parameter command in 3GPP TS 27.007 is used to enable or disable the use of the +CME ERROR: <err> final result code for indicating errors related to the functionality of the Mobile Termination (MT). When enabled, MT-related errors will result in a +CME ERROR: <err> code instead of the regular ERROR code, which is typically used for syntax errors, invalid parameters, or Terminal Adapter (TA) functionality errors.

The +CMEE command has three defined values for <n>:
- 0: Disables the +CME ERROR: <err> result code and uses the regular ERROR code.
- 1: Enables the +CME ERROR: <err> result code and uses numeric <err> values.
- 2: Enables the +CME ERROR: <err> result code and uses verbose <err> values.

The operation of the +CME ERROR: <err> result code is similar to the regular ERROR result code. If +CME ERROR: <err> is returned for any command in a command line, none of the subsequent commands in the same line are executed, and neither ERROR nor OK result codes are returned for the completed command line execution. The format of <err> can be numeric or verbose, as set by the +CMEE command.

The <err> values are reserved in specific ranges for different types of errors:
- Values below 256 are reserved.
- Values from 0 to 100 are reserved for general errors.
- Values from 101 to 150 are reserved for use by Circuit Switched (CS), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Evolved Packet System (EPS), and 5G System (5GS).

"Describe the procedures for creating, modifying, and querying an intent instance as defined in 3GPP TS 28.312.","The procedures for creating, modifying, and querying an intent instance as defined in 3GPP TS 28.312 are as follows:

1. **Creating an Intent Instance**:
   - **Step 1**: The MnS Consumer sends a request to the MnS Producer to create an intent instance, including the intent information for the new intent.
   - **Step 2**: The MnS Producer creates the concrete intent instance and configures it with the received intent information.
   - **Step 3**: The MnS Producer sends a response to the MnS Consumer with the attribute 'objectInstance' of the created intent instance.

Describe the structure and components of the API URI for the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.520 and TS 29.501.,"The API URI for the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service is structured according to the guidelines provided in 3GPP TS 29.520 and TS 29.501. The complete API URI follows the format: {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>.

The components of the API URI are defined as follows:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts, including the scheme ('http' or 'https'), the fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port) as defined in IETF RFC 3986, and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character. The host should be represented by the operator-specific FQDN.
- <apiName>: For the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service, the API name is 'nnwdaf-mlmodelprovision'.
- <apiVersion>: The version of the API is 'v1', indicating the major version of the API.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 5.4.3 of 3GPP TS 29.520, which provides specific details on the resource URI structure for the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service.

"Describe the cell reselection process for a Cat-NB1 UE in normal coverage, including the conditions for relaxed monitoring and the criteria for successful cell reselection.","The cell reselection process for a Category NB1 User Equipment (UE) in normal coverage involves several key settings and criteria. 

Firstly, the primary level settings and test tolerances for E-UTRAN HD-FDD intra-frequency case are defined in tables 4.2.38.5-1 and 4.2.38.5-2. These tables specify the test parameters for nCell 1, nCell 2, eCell 1, and eCell 2, which are essential for the HD-FDD intra-frequency cell reselection test case.

The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE camps on nCell 2 and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on nCell 2. This delay should be less than 69.56 seconds. For an already detected cell, the delay is similarly defined but should also be less than 69.56 seconds.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests must be at least 90%. The statistical pass/fail decisions are done separately for each event, and for an event to pass, the total number of successful loops must be more than 90% of the cases with a confidence level of 95%.

The formula for calculating the cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is given by:
Tevaluate, serv_NB-NC + Tdetect,NB_Intra_NB-IoT-NC + TSI,
where:
- Tdetect,NB_Intra_NB-IoT-NC is based on the configured DRX cycle,
- Tevaluate, serv_NB-NC is based on the effective DRX cycle after relaxation, assumed to be 10.24 seconds in this test case,
- TSI is the maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that need to be received by the UE to camp on a cell, assumed to be 8.32 seconds in this test case.

Regarding relaxed monitoring, the UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency or inter-frequency measurements when the relaxed monitoring criterion in clause 5.2.4.12.1 is fulfilled for a period of TSearchDeltaP, less than 24 hours have passed since measurements for cell reselection were last performed, and the UE has performed intra-frequency or inter-frequency measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after selecting or reselecting a new cell.

In summary, the cell reselection process for a Cat-NB1 UE in normal coverage involves specific test parameters, defined delays for reselection, a required rate of correct reselections, and conditions for relaxed monitoring to ensure efficient and accurate cell reselection.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the primary level settings and test tolerances for the HD-FDD intra-frequency case for Cat-NB1 UE in normal coverage.

  - Requirement for UE to perform measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after selecting or reselecting a new cell."
What are the requirements and procedures for handling the P-Asserted-Identity and Privacy header fields in SIP signaling across II-NNI boundaries according to 3GPP specifications?,"The requirements and procedures for handling the P-Asserted-Identity and Privacy header fields in SIP signaling across II-NNI boundaries according to 3GPP specifications are as follows:

1. **Support for Header Fields**: The P-Asserted-Identity header field and the Privacy header field with values 'id', 'user', 'none', 'header', and 'critical' must be supported at the II-NNI. These fields are crucial for maintaining end-to-end operation and privacy in SIP signaling.

2. **Trust Relationships**: 
   - When a trust relationship exists between two IMS networks, the P-Asserted-Identity header field cannot be altered when passing through the II-NNI. This ensures the integrity of the asserted identity across the networks.
   - If no trust relationship exists, the Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF) determines whether to remove the P-Asserted-Identity header field based on procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.229 clause 4.4.2 and local policy rules. This decision is influenced by the screening capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 clause 5.10.6.

3. **Handling of From Header Field**:
   - If a trust relationship exists with the remote domain, the From header field will be passed transparently by the IBCF.
   - If a SIP request requires the application of the Originating Identity Restriction (OIR) service with the value 'user' for the Privacy header field, the From header field will be anonymized by the terminating network in accordance with IETF RFC 3323.
   - In the absence of a trust relationship, the originating network's IBCF can anonymize the From header field based on local policy rules before passing it through the II-NNI, using screening capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 clauses 5.10.6 and 5.10.8.

4. **Privacy Levels**: The privacy levels 'session' and 'critical' are not used in the Originating Identity Presentation (OIP) and OIR services as described in 3GPP TS 24.607.

5. **RFC 3325 Considerations**: RFC 3325 provides guidelines for the existence and trust of an asserted identity within a trust domain. When SIP signaling crosses the boundary of the trust domain, a functional entity at the boundary must determine whether to remove the P-Asserted-Identity header field according to RFC 3325. The 'id' value in the Privacy header field must not be removed when crossing the trust domain boundary. Additional cases for the removal of the P-Asserted-Identity header field are identified in 3GPP TS 24.229 subclause 5.4.

Overall, these requirements and procedures ensure that SIP signaling across II-NNI boundaries maintains the integrity and privacy of user identities while adhering to established trust relationships and local policy rules.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The specific requirements for supporting P-Asserted-Identity and Privacy header fields at the II-NNI.
  - The impact of trust relationships on the handling of P-Asserted-Identity and From header fields.

Describe the process and requirements for cause code mapping during handovers between GSM and UMTS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.010.,"The process and requirements for cause code mapping during handovers between GSM and UMTS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.010 are as follows:

1. **GSM to GSM Handover**: No mapping of cause codes is required when a mobile station is handed over from GSM to GSM. The MSC uses the cause codes specified in TS 48.008.

2. **UMTS to GSM Handover**: Similarly, no mapping of cause codes is required when a mobile station is handed over from UMTS to GSM. The 3G-MSC uses the cause codes specified in TS 48.008.

3. **GSM to UMTS Handover**: When a mobile station is handed over from GSM to UMTS, a mapping of the cause codes used in the RANAP and BSSMAP protocols is required. This mapping is applicable to the BSSMAP protocol even when used inside MAP in the E-interface. The specific mappings between the cause codes received in RANAP Location Report and the LCS cause codes sent in BSSMAP Perform Location Response are:
   - Requested Report Type not Supported -> Position method failure
   - Requested Information not Available -> Position method failure
   - All other cause codes -> System Failure

4. **Intra-MSC GSM to UMTS Handover**: After the inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover, the MSC-B can perform intra-MSC GSM to UMTS handover. The mapping of cause codes used in the RANAP and BSSMAP protocols is needed and is the same as for Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover.

5. **Intra-MSC UMTS to GSM Handover**: After the inter-MSC UMTS to GSM handover, the 3G MSC-B can perform intra-MSC UMTS to GSM handover. No mapping of cause codes is required after completion of the intra-MSC UMTS to GSM handover, similar to the Inter-MSC GSM to GSM handover.","The answer must include the following details:

"Describe the HTTP/2 Server Push mechanism as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 and TS 29.501, including how it can be enabled or disabled by a NF Service Consumer.","The HTTP/2 Server Push mechanism allows a NF Service Producer to proactively push resources to a NF Service Consumer. According to 3GPP TS 29.500, HTTP/2 Server Push may be supported and used by a NF Service Producer to push resources to a NF Service Consumer. A NF Service Consumer can disable HTTP/2 Server Push by setting the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH parameter to 0, as specified in IETF RFC 7540.

In 3GPP TS 29.501, it is detailed that HTTP/2 Server Push can be used by a NF Service Producer if it is supported in the PLMN. The process involves the NF Service Producer sending PUSH_PROMISE frames in the HTTP response. Each PUSH_PROMISE frame contains a GET request targeting the URI of one resource to be transferred and the reserved stream identifier to be used for transferring the resource. Subsequently, the NF Service Producer sends Push Responses via the corresponding reserved streams, with each Push Response containing the representation of the associated resource. Additionally, the NF Service Producer sends links with the URIs of the resources in DATA frames of the response message.

The steps involved in the HTTP/2 Server Push process are as follows:
1. The NF Service Consumer sends an HTTP request to the NF Service Producer to get resources, such as querying a collection of resources.
2. The NF Service Producer detects that multiple resources need to be returned and chooses to deliver the resources indirectly using the Server Push mechanism.
3. The NF Service Producer returns multiple PUSH_PROMISE requests before the HEADERS frame and DATA frames to the NF Service Consumer. Each PUSH_PROMISE request contains the URI of one resource to be transferred and the identifier of the reserved stream used for transferring the resource. Links with the URIs of the resources are also sent in DATA frames of the response message.
4. The NF Service Producer sends Push Responses via corresponding reserved streams, with each Push Response containing the representation of the associated resource.
5. If the NF Service Consumer does not successfully receive a resource in time, it may send a request to get that resource using the resource URI previously received from the Push Request. The NF Service Producer then returns the data of the requested resource in the response.

To disable HTTP/2 Server Push, a NF Service Consumer can send the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH parameter with a value of '0' at the HTTP level, as specified in IETF RFC 7540.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - Explanation of HTTP/2 Server Push mechanism.

"Describe the procedures and mechanisms specified in TS 23.007 for reducing signaling latency, optimizing resource utilization, and handling partial or complete failures in PGW-C/SMF sets.","The procedures specified in TS 23.007 aim to reduce signaling latency and achieve better load balancing among PGW-C/SMFs. This is accomplished by enabling an SMF/PGW-C to request MME/ePDG supporting S2b over GTPv2/UPF to move PDN connections and PFCP sessions associated with certain FQ-CSIDs, Group IDs, or PGW-C/SMF IP Addresses to another PGW-C/SMF in the set without causing mass signaling. The FQ-CSID can only be used if the partial failure feature is deployed and used; otherwise, a Group ID or a PGW-C/SMF IP address must be used.

To optimize resource utilization for PDN connections and PFCP sessions, a PGW-C/SMF in a set may allocate a globally unique Group ID in the PGW Change Info IE during PDN connection creation or mobility procedures, and update the Group ID if necessary in subsequent messages. Similarly, a globally unique Group ID can be allocated during PFCP session establishment and updated in subsequent modification requests. If partial failure handling is supported and deployed, an FQ-CSID may be assigned to a PDN connection or PFCP session.

In the event of a partial or complete failure affecting all PDN connections and PFCP sessions sharing the same FQ-CSID or Group ID, a PGW-C/SMF in the set may trigger the restoration procedure for those affected connections and sessions as specified in the relevant clauses of TS 23.007.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the rules and guidelines for defining and using user-defined data types in 3GPP TS 32.156, particularly focusing on attribute properties and structured data types.","In 3GPP TS 32.156, user-defined data types are essential for modeling structured data types. These data types can be simple, containing one or more values of a single type like integer or string, or structured, containing multiple named attribute fields with properties similar to those described in Table 5.2.1.1-1. The names of predefined and user-defined data types must be chosen to avoid clashes.

Structured data types can be embedded up to three levels deep (attribute-structuredType-structuredType-structuredType-simpletype) to maintain clarity and usability. Deep embedding is discouraged because it complicates understanding, addressing, filtering, and usability in interfaces.

Attribute properties can be declared at multiple levels: for the attribute as a whole and for each attribute field. Properties such as multiplicity, isOrdered, isUnique, type, and allowedValues are always relevant and should be enforced at the level where they are declared. The supportQualifier property applies to the level where it is declared, but its support is conditional on the higher level's support.

For properties like isReadable, isWritable, and isNotifyable, specific rules apply:
- If a structured attribute specifies the property as False, it applies to the attribute and all its descendant fields.
- If specified as True, it applies to the attribute and all its descendant fields only if True is specified for all of them.
- If True is specified until a False value is encountered, the False value applies to that field and all its descendants.

For the isInvariant property:
- If specified as True, it applies to the attribute and all its descendant fields.
- If specified as False, it applies to the attribute and all its descendant fields only if False is specified for all of them.
- If False is specified until a True value is encountered, the True value applies to that field and all its descendants.

"Describe the requirements and timing constraints for UE during an E-UTRAN FDD – FDD Intra-band Inter-frequency async DAPS handover, including the definitions and values of Dhandover1 and Dhandover2.","During an E-UTRAN FDD – FDD Intra-band Inter-frequency async DAPS handover, the UE must adhere to specific requirements and timing constraints. 

Dhandover1 is the time within which the UE must be ready to start transmitting on the new uplink PRACH channel after receiving the RRC message. The formula for Dhandover1 is:
Dhandover1 = TRRC_procedure + TIU + 20 ms
Where:
- TRRC_procedure is the RRC procedure delay, specified as 15 ms in clause 11.2 of TS 36.331.
- TIU is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the new cell, which can be up to 30 ms.

During Dhandover1, the UE must be continuously scheduled on Cell 1, and the interruption on Cell 1 must not exceed 6 ms (Tinterrupt1).

After the successful RACH procedure of the target cell, when the UE receives an RRC message implying a source cell release command, the UE must complete the release actions specified in TS 38.331 within Dhandover2. The formula for Dhandover2 is:
Dhandover2 = TRRC_procedure + Tinterrupt2

This IE specifies the E-UTRA frequencies for which the corresponding EARFCN is less than 65535 to be reported back to the source RAT, each associated with a measurement bandwidth, the minimum radio quality, and the period of time that the measurements should last before triggering a HO Report for unnecessary handover to another RAT. The coding elements include:

- REPORTING_THRESHOLD: Defines the reporting threshold for measurement results analysis according to REP_QUANT. It is a value between 0 and 63 encoded on 6 bits.
- REP_QUANT: Indicates the measurement quantity for E-UTRAN cells, coded as 0 for RSRP and 1 for RSRQ.
- Measurement_Duration: Defines the duration (in seconds) for which the BSS should collect measurement results from the MS after a successful inter-RAT handover. It ranges from 1 to 100 in binary representation.
- E-ARFCN: Designates a specific E-UTRA frequency for which the target RAT should continue to collect measurement results from the MS. It ranges from 0 to 65534 in binary representation.

"Describe the authentication and ciphering procedures in GSM networks, including the key elements involved and their interactions.","The authentication and ciphering procedures in GSM networks involve several key elements and interactions to ensure secure communication. 

The authentication procedure begins with the fixed subsystem transmitting a non-predictable number, RAND, to the Mobile Station (MS). The MS computes the signature of RAND, known as SRES, using algorithm A3 and the Individual Subscriber Authentication Key (Ki). The MS then transmits the signature SRES back to the fixed subsystem, which tests SRES for validity. The IMSI is used to retrieve Ki in the network.

Ki and IMSI are allocated at subscription time and stored in the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) within an Authentication Centre (AuC). The AuC can be integrated with other functions, such as a Home Location Register (HLR). When needed, the BSS/MSC/VLR requests security-related information from the HLR/AuC, including pairs of RAND and SRES obtained by applying algorithm A3 to each RAND and Ki. These pairs are stored in the VLR as part of the security-related information. During authentication, the MSC/VLR chooses a RAND value from the array corresponding to the MS and tests the MS's response by comparing it with the corresponding SRES.

The ciphering process involves the layer 1 data flow being ciphered by a bit per bit or stream cipher. The data flow on the radio path is obtained by the bit per bit binary addition of the user data flow and a ciphering bit stream generated by algorithm A5 using a key, Kc or Kc128. For multislot configurations, different ciphering bit streams are used on different timeslots, derived from the 64-bit Kc or 128-bit Kc128 using a binary encoding of the timeslot number and bit per bit binary addition with a circular shift.

Mutual key setting allows the mobile station and the network to agree on the key Kc for ciphering and deciphering algorithms A5. This procedure is triggered by the authentication process and must occur on a DCCH not yet encrypted once the mobile subscriber's identity is known. Kc is derived from RAND using algorithm A8 and Ki. The values Kc are computed together with SRES values and stored by the mobile station until updated at the next authentication.

Additionally, security-related network functions for General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) are applicable if GPRS is supported, as specified in Annex D.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The steps of the authentication procedure, including the roles of RAND, SRES, Ki, and algorithm A3.

"What are the key elements and methods for assessing NG-RAN data energy efficiency (EE) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.310, TS 28.554, and TS 28.552?","The assessment of NG-RAN data energy efficiency (EE) is based on the high-level mobile network data EE KPI defined in 3GPP TS 28.310. This KPI is calculated by dividing the data volume by the energy consumption (EC) of the considered network elements. The KPI is applicable to both non-split and split gNB scenarios and is specifically defined in clause 6.7.1 of 3GPP TS 28.554.

"Describe the testing setup and procedures for measuring signal-to-total-distortion power ratios in handset, headset, or hands-free UE as specified in 3GPP TS 26.132.","The testing setup and procedures for measuring signal-to-total-distortion power ratios in handset, headset, or hands-free UE as specified in 3GPP TS 26.132 involve several detailed steps and requirements:

1. **Setup of UE and Electrical Interface**: The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is set up as described in clause 5, and the electrical interface UE is set up as described in clause 5.1.6.

2. **Test Signal Frequencies and Levels**: The test signal used is a sine-wave signal with frequencies 315, 408, 510, 816, and 1020 Hz. The signal level is -16 dBm0, except for the 1020 Hz signal, which is applied at various levels: 0, -3, -10, -16, -20, -30, -40, -45 dBm0. The test signals are applied in sequence from high levels to low levels.

3. **Duration of Sine-Wave Signal**: The recommended duration of the sine-wave signal is 360 ms, with the manufacturer allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured part of the signal is 170.667 ms.

4. **Activation Signal Usage**: An optional activation signal is recommended to be presented immediately preceding each test signal to ensure the UE is in a typical state during measurement. The activation signal should be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 or P.50. The RMS level of the activation signal should match the subsequent test tone RMS level for low and medium test levels, and for high test levels, the activation signal level should be adjusted to avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder. The manufacturer can specify disabling the activation signal, and it must be reported whether an activation signal was used along with its characteristics.

5. **Measurement Points**: The signal-to-total-distortion power ratio is measured at the applicable acoustic measurement point (DRP with diffuse-field correction for handset and headset modes; free field for hands-free modes) for handset, headset, or hands-free UE, and at the applicable electric measurement point (input to the electrical reference interface) for electrical interface UE.

6. **Psophometric Noise Weighting**: Psophometric noise weighting is applied to the measured signal, with the psophometric filter normalized to have 0 dB gain at 800 Hz.

7. **Band-Stop Filter Characteristics**: An octave-wide band-stop filter is applied to suppress the sine-wave signal and associated coding artifacts. The filter has a lower passband ending at 0.7071 * fS and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * fS, with a passband ripple ≤ 0.2 dB and attenuation at the sine-wave frequency ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively, appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an FFT can be used.

8. **Repeatability and Averaging of Test Sequences**: To improve repeatability, the test sequence may be repeated one or more times, and the single signal-to-total-distortion power ratios obtained from such repeats are averaged. The total result is calculated as 10 * log10 of this average in dB.

9. **Testing Environment and Noise Level Requirements for Hands-Free Terminals**: Hands-free terminals should be tested in their typical environment, ensuring noise levels are sufficiently low to not interfere with measurements. For desktop hands-free terminals, requirements from ITU-T Recommendation P.340 are used, with broadband noise levels not exceeding -70 dBPa(A) and octave band noise levels specified in Table 2.

10. **Accuracy Requirements for Test Equipment and Signal Generation**: The accuracy of measurements made by test equipment should not exceed the requirements defined in Table 1a, and the accuracy of signals generated by test equipment should exceed the requirements in Table 1b. Sound level measurement equipment should conform to IEC 61672 class 1 accuracy.

These procedures ensure accurate and repeatable measurements of signal-to-total-distortion power ratios in various UE configurations.","The answer should include the setup procedures for the UE and electrical interface, the specific frequencies and levels of the test signals, the recommended duration of the sine-wave signal, the use and characteristics of the activation signal, the measurement points for acoustic and electric interfaces, the application of psophometric noise weighting, the characteristics of the band-stop filter, the repeatability and averaging of test sequences, the testing environment and noise level requirements for hands-free terminals, the accuracy requirements for test equipment and signal generation, and the standards for sound level measurement equipment."

Describe the handling and structure of Information Elements (IEs) in GTPv2 messages according to 3GPP TS 29.274 specifications.,"The handling and structure of Information Elements (IEs) in GTPv2 messages are defined by the TLIV (Type, Length, Instance, Value) coding format. Each IE has mandatory fields including Type, Length, and Instance. The Type field indicates the type of the IE, with valid values defined in the specifications. The Length field contains the length of the IE, excluding the first four octets, and the bits in the length field are significant, with bit 8 of the lowest numbered octet being the most significant bit and bit 1 of the highest numbered octet being the least significant bit. The Instance field differentiates among different parameters using the same IE type within a specific message.

Unexpected IEs with a known Type but undefined Instance values must be discarded, and the rest of the message should be processed as if the unexpected IE was not present. This ensures that the message processing continues smoothly without interruption.

IEs can have different types of lengths: fixed, variable, and extendable. Fixed length IEs have a set number of fields and octets, variable length IEs have a set number of fields but a variable number of octets, and extendable IEs have a variable number of fields and octets. For extendable IEs, any unknown octets should be ignored by the receiving entity.

To improve troubleshooting efficiency, it is recommended that IEs be arranged in the order listed in the message definition table or grouped IE definition table. However, the receiving entity must be capable of handling messages with IEs in any order. Additionally, certain fields within IEs may be described as spare and should be transmitted with a value of 0, but the receiver should not evaluate these bits to allow for future features.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The TLIV (Type, Length, Instance, Value) coding format for GTPv2 information elements.
- The handling of unexpected IEs with known Type but undefined Instance values, including the requirement to discard such IEs and continue processing the message.
- The types of length for IEs (fixed, variable, extendable) and how they are defined.
- The mandatory fields in an IE and their significance, including the bit significance in the length field.
- The recommendation for ordering IEs in messages and the flexibility required by the receiving entity."
Describe the process and requirements for PSS clients and servers to handle capabilities and bookmarking features according to 3GPP TS 26.234 specifications.,"According to 3GPP TS 26.234 specifications, PSS clients and servers must handle capabilities and bookmarking features through specific processes and requirements.

Firstly, PSS clients use the 'Supported' and 'Require' header fields to communicate their capabilities and determine the server's capabilities. The 'Supported' header field is used to indicate the extensions supported by the client or server, and it should be included in any request as early as possible, such as with the DESCRIBE request. If a feature is required for a specific request, the 'Require' header field is used to ensure that the feature is supported by the server. If the server does not support the required feature, the request will fail with a 551 reply code, and the unsupported features will be listed in the 'Unsupported' header field. The 'Require' header field should not be used for probing support for features but rather to ensure correct execution of a specific request.

The 'Supported' RTSP header field is mandatory for both PSS clients and servers. It enumerates all the extensions supported by the message-sending entity using feature tags. When a request includes the 'Supported' header, the server must respond with its corresponding 'Supported' header. If the server's response does not include the 'Supported' header, the client should assume that the server does not support any of the indicated features. The 'Supported' header must be included in both error and success responses.

Bookmarking in PSS allows a client to mark a point in time in the streamed content. The bookmark can be stored either at a bookmarking server accessible via HTTP or at the PSS server accessible via RTSP. The bookmark is formatted as an XML document according to the XML schema provided in Annex T, and its MIME type is 'application/vnd.3gpp.bookmarking+xml'. Procedures for registration and providing the address of the bookmarking server are out of scope of the specification.

For bookmarking at the PSS server, the RTSP method SET_PARAMETER is used. The body of the SET_PARAMETER requests and responses is formatted according to the XML schema defined in Annex T, and the content type is 'application/vnd.3gpp.bookmarking+xml'. If the server does not support bookmarking, it will reply with a 451 Parameter Not Understood. To check for bookmarking support in advance, the client can include the '3gpp-bookmarking' feature tag in the 'Supported' header field in any preceding RTSP requests. The XML bookmarking document is used for storage, retrieval, and deletion of bookmarks, formatted in the same way as described for HTTP-based bookmarking.

In summary, PSS clients and servers must use the 'Supported' and 'Require' header fields to communicate capabilities and handle unsupported features, support the 'Supported' RTSP header field to enumerate extensions, and follow specific procedures for bookmarking, including the use of the SET_PARAMETER method and XML formatting.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of how PSS clients use 'Supported' and 'Require' header fields to communicate capabilities and handle unsupported features.
  - Description of the 'Supported' RTSP header field, its mandatory support, and its role in enumerating extensions.
  - Overview of bookmarking in PSS, including storage options, XML format, and MIME type.
  - Specifics of using the RTSP SET_PARAMETER method for bookmarking at the PSS server, including the XML format and handling unsupported features."
"How is the UE delay in the sending direction measured according to 3GPP TS 26.132, and what are the key considerations for different bandwidths?","The UE delay in the sending direction is measured by setting up the handset terminal as described in clause 5.1.1. The delay is obtained by measuring the time between the MRP (Measurement Reference Point) and the electrical access point of the test equipment, and then subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured value. A Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 is used for the measurements, with the pseudo-random noise part of the CSS being longer than the maximum expected delay. A pn sequence of 32 k samples with a 48 kHz sampling rate is recommended, and the test signal level is set at -4.7 dBPa at the MRP.

The reference signal is the original test signal, and the delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between the measured signal at the electrical access point and the original signal. The measurement is corrected by subtracting the test equipment delay (TTES). The delay is measured in milliseconds, and the maximum of the cross-correlation function is used for determination.

For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR, or WLAN access, a variability of up to 20ms may be expected between different calls due to synchronization issues. The maximum value of the UE sending delay obtained from at least five individual calls is reported as the UE delay in the sending direction. Additionally, a further variability of up to 20ms may be expected due to synchronization at the receiver, and this variability should be deducted from the UE sending delay if the test equipment does not adjust for it. This correction value must be reported in the test report.

The test method for wideband and super-wideband follows the same procedure as described in clause 8.10.1, ensuring consistency across different bandwidths.","The answer should include the setup of the handset terminal, the use of Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501, the process of measuring delay using cross-correlation analysis, and the reporting of UE delay values. It should also mention the variability expected in MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR, or WLAN access, and the necessary corrections for test equipment uncertainty. Additionally, it should confirm that the test methods for wideband and super-wideband follow the same procedure as described in clause 8.10.1."
"Describe the EAS registration procedure, including pre-conditions, request and response information elements, and API operation details.","The EAS registration procedure involves several pre-conditions, steps, and specific information elements in the request and response, as well as details about the API operation used for registration.

Pre-conditions for EAS registration include:
1. The EAS has been configured with an EASID.
2. The EAS has been configured with the address (e.g., URI) of the EES.
3. Both the EAS and EES have the necessary credentials to enable communications.

The step-by-step procedure for EAS registration is as follows:
1. The EAS determines that registration to the EES is needed, such as when the EAS is instantiated and started up.
2. The EAS sends an EAS registration request to the EES. This request includes the EAS profile and may propose an expiration time for the registration.
3. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has the authorization to register on the EES.
4. Upon successful authorization, the EES stores the EAS profile for later use (e.g., for serving EAS discovery requests received from EECs) and replies to the EAS with an EAS registration response. The EES may provide an expiration time to indicate when the registration will automatically expire. To maintain the registration, the EAS must send a registration update request before the expiration time. If a registration update request is not received before the expiration time, the EES will treat the EAS as implicitly de-registered.

The information elements in the EAS registration request from the EAS to the EES are described in Table 8.4.3.3.2-1. Similarly, the information elements in the EAS registration response from the EES to the EAS are detailed in Table 8.4.3.3.3-1.

The API operation name for EAS registration is Eees_EASRegistration_Request. The inputs for this operation are specified in clause 8.4.3.3.2, and the outputs are detailed in clause 8.4.3.3.3. For detailed usage of this operation, refer to clause 8.4.3.2.2.","The answer should include the pre-conditions required for EAS registration, the detailed steps involved in the registration procedure, the specific information elements included in the EAS registration request and response, and the API operation name along with its inputs and outputs.

What are the requirements for MBMS clients supporting 360 VR video for DASH-over-MBMS services according to 3GPP specifications?,"According to 3GPP specifications, MBMS clients supporting 360 VR video for DASH-over-MBMS services must adhere to several requirements. Firstly, only a single Adaptation Set for each media type should be offered in an MPD for DASH-over-MBMS. Additionally, if the MBMS client supports 360 VR video, it must include a receiver that complies with the Basic Video Media Profile Receiver requirements for DASH as specified in TS 26.118, clause 5.2.2. Furthermore, it should include a receiver that complies with the Main Video Media Profile Receiver requirements for DASH as specified in TS 26.118, clause 5.2.3. However, it is important to note that the receiver is not expected to handle Media Adaptation Set Ensembles for Viewport-Optimized offerings as defined in TS 26.118, clause 5.2.3.3.4.","The answer should include the requirement for MBMS clients to support a single Adaptation Set for each media type in an MPD for DASH-over-MBMS.

"Describe the use cases and functionalities of SAND for Multi-Network Access as outlined in TS 26.247 13.10.1, particularly in the context of DASH-over-MBMS service.","The primary use case for SAND (Server and Network Assisted DASH) for Multi-Network Access involves the distribution of DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) content over MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service). In this scenario, the MBMS client acts as a DASH server or a DASH Aware Network Element (DANE) to provide DASH formats compatible with the specification to the DASH client. The client architecture follows the guidelines provided in TS26.347, Figure 5.2. The MBMS client may offer full DASH server functionalities or a simplified version as a DANE, which is particularly relevant for supporting MBMS-operation-on-Demand (MooD) and MBMS service continuity. The DANE functionality allows dynamic steering of the DASH client between different resources, such as broadcast distributed resources and unicast resources. Clause 7.4 in TS26.347 outlines various options for DASH-specific interfaces between the MBMS client and the DASH client, with the use of SAND documented in clause 7.4.3.

The second major use case involves users joining the DASH-over-MBMS service while it is already in progress. This requires the DASH server/DANE to indicate which segments are cached and which are not, as the user may not have been in broadcast coverage earlier. It also includes signalling for segments that may have been lost or removed from the local cache.

The functionalities required and recommended for DANE and DASH client are designed to fulfill SAND for MBMS functionalities but are not restricted to this use case. They can also be used in other contexts, particularly when using multiple networks for distribution and dynamic steering across networks. Specific scenarios considered include:
- Networks may go down dynamically and reappear.
- Not all resources announced in the Media Presentation Description (MPD) are always accessible on all networks, such as broadcast resources being unavailable when the device is outside broadcast coverage.
- Networks may have different availability times.
- Not all resources are available on all networks all the time.
- The DANE may issue preferences for one network.
- Information may be established through inband and out-of-band channels.","The answer must cover the primary use case of distributing DASH content over MBMS, the role of the MBMS client in providing DASH functionalities, the dynamic steering of the DASH client between different resources, and the specific scenarios where networks may go down, resources may not be accessible, and the DANE may issue network preferences. Additionally, it should mention the second use case of joining an ongoing DASH-over-MBMS service and the required signalling for cached and lost segments."
"Explain the load sharing function in the Gb interface as described in 3GPP TS 48.016, including the role of the Link Selector Parameter and the process of selecting remote IP endpoints.","The load sharing function in the Gb interface is designed to distribute NS SDUs and SNS PDUs traffic among the available IP endpoints, ensuring seamless service to the upper layer even in case of endpoint failure. This function is implemented in both the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) and the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).

The load sharing function determines the local IP endpoint locally and the remote IP endpoint based on weight information provided by the peer Network Service Entity (NSE). Each NSE uses an implementation-dependent load sharing function to associate the local IP endpoint with all NS SDU traffic related to a Mobile Station (MS). The remote IP endpoint is initially determined by distributing traffic in proportion to the relative weights assigned to the peer NSE's endpoints, known as signalling weight and data weight. These weights are communicated using SNS-CONFIG, SNS-ADD, and SNS-CHANGE-WEIGHT PDUs.

For each NS-SDU, an NS entity selects a remote IP endpoint based on the Link Selector Parameter (LSP). If the LSP has not been associated with a remote IP endpoint, the selection is made according to the data weights assigned to the peer NSE's IP endpoints. The remote IP endpoints are selected in equal proportion to these data weights, which range from 0 to 255. A data weight of 0 indicates that the endpoint should not be initially associated with an LSP, although it can be associated later via the Resource Distribution Function.

Examples of equal proportion selection include:
- If endpoint A has a data weight of 5 and endpoint B has a data weight of 10, endpoint B will be selected twice as often as endpoint A.
- If both endpoints A and B have a data weight of 10, they will be selected equally.
- If endpoint A has a data weight of 0, it will not be selected initially but may be associated later.

Once a remote IP endpoint is selected for an LSP, the NSE maintains the linkage so that NS SDUs with the same LSP are directed to the same remote IP endpoint. If the endpoint is taken out of service, another endpoint is selected based on the data weights. The association can be changed by the peer NSE using the Resource Distribution Function.

The Link Selector Parameter is used locally at the BSS and SGSN and is included in the NS-UNITDATA-Request and NS-UNITDATA-Indication primitives for load sharing and resource distribution purposes. It references the local and remote IP endpoints when the NS Change IP endpoint parameter has the cause value of 'request change flow'.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose and implementation of the load sharing function in the Gb interface.
  - How traffic is distributed among IP endpoints and the role of weight information.
  - The process of selecting remote IP endpoints based on data weights and maintaining associations.
  - The role and usage of the Link Selector Parameter in load sharing and resource distribution."
Describe the key elements and functionalities of DCI format 3_1 for scheduling LTE PSCCH and LTE PSSCH in one cell.,"DCI format 3_1 is utilized for scheduling LTE Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH) and LTE Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) within a single cell. The information transmitted by DCI format 3_1 includes several key elements:

1. **Timing Offset**: This is a 3-bit field determined by the higher layer parameter sl-TimeOffsetEUTRA-List, which is defined in clause 16.6 of TS 38.213.
2. **Carrier Indicator**: This 3-bit field is defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212 and indicates the carrier used for transmission.
3. **Lowest Index of the Subchannel Allocation**: This field specifies the initial transmission subchannel allocation and is defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212.
4. **Frequency Resource Location**: This field indicates the frequency resource location for both initial transmission and retransmission, as defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212.
5. **Time Gap**: This field specifies the time gap between the initial transmission and retransmission, as defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212.
6. **SL Index**: This 2-bit field is defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212 and indicates the sidelink index.
7. **SL SPS Configuration Index**: This 3-bit field is defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212 and specifies the sidelink semi-persistent scheduling configuration index.
8. **Activation/Release Indication**: This 1-bit field is defined in clause 5.3.3.1.9A of TS 36.212 and indicates whether the scheduling is activated or released.

Additionally, if the User Equipment (UE) is configured to monitor DCI format 3_0 and the number of information bits in DCI format 3_1 is less than the payload of DCI format 3_0, zeros are appended to DCI format 3_1 until the payload size matches that of DCI format 3_0. This ensures compatibility and proper functioning of the scheduling mechanism.","The answer must include a detailed description of each element transmitted by DCI format 3_1, including timing offset, carrier indicator, subchannel allocation, frequency resource location, time gap, SL index, SL SPS configuration index, and activation/release indication. It should also explain the procedure for handling payload size differences between DCI format 3_1 and DCI format 3_0, specifically the appending of zeros to match the payload size."
"Describe the key functionalities and requirements for Multi-stream Multiparty Conferencing Media Handling (MMCMH) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.333, including the use of simulcast, RTP-level pause and resume, and BFCP floor control.","Multi-stream Multiparty Conferencing Media Handling (MMCMH) is a feature supported by the Media Resource Function Controller (MRFC) and the Media Resource Function Processor (MRFP) to enhance conferencing capabilities. MMCMH utilizes simulcast and RTP-level pause and resume functionalities, along with BFCP floor control.

Simulcast functionality allows multiple streams of the same media content to be sent simultaneously, with different encoding parameters. This is negotiated via SDP offer/answer exchange using media level SDP attributes such as 'a=simulcast' (defined in IETF RFC 8853) and 'a=rid' (defined in IETF RFC 8851). The 'a=rid' attribute ensures unique identification of simulcast formats within a media clause. The 'a=content' attribute (defined in IETF RFC 4796) indicates the content of RTP streams, with 'a=content:main' for the main video and 'a=content:slides' for screenshare video. Thumbnails, which are smaller resolution videos, can be offered under the main video 'm=' line or as separate 'm=' lines.

A typical MMCMH use case involves each conference participant sending a main and a thumbnail video, receiving one main video (depicting the current speaker), and thumbnail videos for other participants. The main audio 'm=' line is prioritized in SDP offers to ensure compatibility with non-MMCMH capable participants. Multiple audio streams are indicated as separate 'm=' lines, with the number of supported channels specified per stream.

RTP-level pause and resume functionality is negotiated via SDP offer/answer exchange using the 'a=rtcp-fb' attribute (defined in IETF RFC 4585) extended to include pause and resume requests. RTCP feedback messages defined in IETF RFC 7728 include 'PAUSE', 'RESUME', 'REFUSED', and 'PAUSED'. The 'config' pause attribute can restrict the use of this functionality.

BFCP floor control, specified in clause 5.14, is used to manage main video and screenshare video. The MRFC and MRFP must support BFCP floor control server roles.

Specific requirements for MRFC include supporting separate RTP payload types for simulcast formats using the 'pt=' parameter on the 'a=rid' line. The MRFP must support sending at least two thumbnails, receiving at least one thumbnail-sized simulcast format of the main video, and the BFCP floor control server role. It must also support 'RTP-level pause and resume' functionality corresponding to 'config=2' and should support the full functionality corresponding to 'config=1'.

Overall, MMCMH enhances conferencing by enabling efficient media handling, flexible stream management, and robust control mechanisms.","Key details the answer must include:

Describe the procedures and timers involved in the invocation and handling of the MCID service as per 3GPP TS 24.616.,"The invocation and handling of the Malicious Call Identification (MCID) service as per 3GPP TS 24.616 involve several procedures and timers:

1. **Storing Information and Handling Temporary Subscriptions**:
   - The Application Server (AS) registers stored information, but the exact procedure is implementation-dependent and out of scope.
   - For subscribers with temporary subscriptions, the AS stores elements of a received INVITE request for a limited period after the communication is released. If an initial INVITE request is received during this period, the AS registers the stored information. If no MCID request is received, the stored elements can be deleted.
   - A reINVITE request from the served user is identified as an MCID request, and the AS registers the required information. The procedure for registration is implementation-dependent.
   - After receiving a BYE request from the originating side, the call state is held for a time defined by Timer TMCID-BYE. Upon expiry, the BYE request is forwarded to the served user, and the communication is released according to basic procedures.

2. **Requesting Missing or Incomplete Originating IDs**:
   - When interacting with N/ISDN, if an initial INVITE request lacks originating identification, the AS sends an INFO request containing a XML mcid body requesting the originating ID, based on operator policy.
   - If requested by operator policy, the AS may skip sending the INFO request and continue with session setup.
   - After sending the INFO request, Timer TO-ID is started. Upon receiving the Identification response, the timer is stopped, MCID information is stored, and a 180 (Ringing) response is sent to the originating user.
   - If the Identification response lacks the originating identity, the timer is stopped, and a 180 (Ringing) response is sent.
   - If Timer TO-ID expires before receiving the Identification response, a 180 (Ringing) response is sent.

3. **Invoking the MCID Service**:
   - During a call, the User Equipment (UE) sends a reINVITE request including a XML MIME with XML mcid body containing a McidRequestIndicator set to 1. As a network operator option, the UE can skip including the XML MIME.
   - After a completed call, the UE sends an initial INVITE request with a Request-URI set to an operator-specific URI and includes media for receiving an announcement.

4. **Timers**:
   - **Timer TO-ID**: Initiated at the AS after sending an MCID request in an INFO request, with a duration of 4-15 seconds. It stops upon receiving an INFO request with the MCID XML Response schema. Upon expiry, communication continues according to basic procedures.
   - **Timer TMCID-BYE**: Initiated at the AS after receiving a CANCEL or BYE request, with a recommended duration of 0-120 seconds, defined by the operator. Upon expiry, communication is released according to basic procedures.

These procedures and timers ensure the proper invocation and handling of the MCID service, allowing for the identification and management of malicious calls.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The procedure for storing information and handling temporary subscriptions, including the conditions under which information is registered or deleted.
  - The process for requesting missing or incomplete originating IDs, including the use of INFO requests and the role of operator policy.

Describe the structure and components of the API URI for the Nnef_EASDeployment service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.591 and TS 29.501.,"The API URI for the Nnef_EASDeployment service is structured as follows: {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>. According to 3GPP TS 29.591, the specific values for these components are defined as:
- {apiRoot}: This is set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501, which includes the scheme ('http' or 'https'), the fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port), and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) starting with a '/' character.
- <apiName>: For the Nnef_EASDeployment service, this is 'nnef-eas-deployment'.
- <apiVersion>: This is 'v1', indicating the major version of the API.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.591.

In general, as described in 3GPP TS 29.501, a URI uniquely identifies a resource and can be either an individual resource or a structured resource containing child resources. The structure of a resource URI in 5GC SBI APIs follows the format {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>, where:
- 'apiRoot' is a concatenation of the scheme, authority, and optional deployment-specific string.
- 'apiName' defines the name of the API.
- 'apiVersion' indicates the major version of the API.
- 'apiSpecificResourceUriPart' defines a resource URI relative to the API URI.

An API URI should not contain a trailing slash, and if it does, it should be ignored or removed.

Describe the process and requirements for creating an HNBProfile instance as per TS 32.572 7.2.1.,"To create an HNBProfile instance, the IRPManager must follow several steps and adhere to specific requirements. Firstly, the IRPManager needs to create a dataset that holds information referred to by the HNBProfile.configuration. This dataset must be named according to the File Naming Convention specified in Annex A, with the specificIRP_extension field set to 'HNB'. The file schema for this dataset is defined in subclause 4.2.2.

Next, the IRPManager prepares the values for the attribute criterion and the attribute userLabel of the HNBProfile that is to be created. The creation of the HNBProfile instance can be done using either the Basic CM IRP IS createMO method or the Bulk CM IRP IS BulkCmCreateMo (Create MO Sub-operation) method. If the Basic CM IRP method is used, a positive response or a notifyObjectCreation indicates successful creation, while a negative response indicates failure and may include the reason for the failure. If the Bulk CM IRP method is used, a notifyObjectCreation indicates successful creation, and the outcome can be recorded in the session log, which the IRPManager can review to determine the success of the creation.

It is crucial that the IRPManager does not remove or modify the dataset referred to by HNBProfile.configuration as long as the HNBProfile instance exists. This ensures that the IRPAgent can read the dataset during HNB registration, regardless of whether the IRPAgent makes a local copy of the dataset or reads it directly during registration.

During the registration process, the IRPAgent-Serving HMS identifies a stored HNBProfile.criterion that corresponds to the registration information provided by the HNB. If multiple criteria match, the IRPAgent-Serving HMS decides which HNBProfile.configuration to use. The IRPAgent-Serving HMS then configures the HNB using the identified HNBProfile.configuration through interactions specified in Clause 5.2.1.

Overall, the process involves careful preparation and adherence to naming conventions, proper handling of responses and session logs, and strict maintenance of the dataset to ensure successful creation and registration of the HNBProfile instance.","Key details the answer must include:
  - The creation of a dataset and naming convention.
  - Preparation of attribute criterion and userLabel.
  - Methods for creating the HNBProfile instance (Basic CM IRP IS and Bulk CM IRP IS).
  - Handling responses and session logs.
  - Restrictions on modifying or removing the dataset.
  - Interaction details for registration and configuration of HNBProfile."
What are the requirements for handover delay and interruption time during E-UTRAN to GSM handover as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The requirements for handover delay and interruption time during E-UTRAN to GSM handover as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 include several key conditions. Firstly, if the User Equipment (UE) has not synchronized to the GSM cell before receiving the RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command, the handover delay and interruption time requirements are valid only when the signal quality of the GSM cell is sufficient for successful synchronization with one attempt. If the UE is unable to synchronize to the GSM cell on the first attempt, it must continue to search for synchronization information for up to 800 ms. If synchronization is not achieved within 800 ms, the UE must follow the handover failure procedure specified in 3GPP TS 36.331.

When the UE receives the RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command, it must be ready to transmit on the channel of the new Radio Access Technology (RAT) within the value defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 5.3.3.2.1. The UE must process the RRC procedures for the MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command within 50 ms, which is noted as the RRC procedure delay.

The interruption time is defined as the time between the end of the Transmission Time Interval (TTI) containing the RRC command on the E-UTRAN Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and the time the UE starts transmission on the uplink channel in GSM, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The interruption time depends on whether the UE has synchronized to the target GSM cell or not and must be less than the value defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 5.3.3.2.1.

These requirements ensure that the handover process is efficient and minimizes service disruption during the transition from E-UTRAN to GSM.","The answer should cover the handover delay and interruption time requirements for E-UTRAN to GSM handover, including the conditions when the UE has not synchronized to the GSM cell before receiving the RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command. It should mention the 800 ms duration for synchronization attempts and the subsequent handover failure procedure if synchronization is not achieved. Additionally, it should include the UE's readiness to transmit on the new RAT channel within the specified value in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 5.3.3.2.1, and the processing of RRC procedures within 50 ms."
"Explain the Overload Control feature in 3GPP TS 29.274, including its activation, parameters, and handling across different network nodes.","The Overload Control feature in 3GPP TS 29.274 is designed to manage network congestion by controlling signaling traffic during overload situations. The feature's activation, parameters, and handling across different network nodes are detailed as follows:

1. **Parameters of Overload Control Information**: The parameters involved in Overload Control Information are summarized in table 12.3.5.1.3-1. These parameters are essential for the proper functioning and management of the Overload Control feature within the network.

2. **Activation and Determination of Use**: According to clause 12.3.11, a GTP-C entity determines whether to use the Overload Control feature based on the operator's policy. This can be configured locally within the PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) or across PLMN boundaries. The feature can be activated when all or some of the nodes in the PLMN support it. Once activated, the GTP-C entity assumes that all peer nodes support the feature, eliminating the need to determine individual peer support. The operator's policy may allow the use of overload control at the node level and APN (Access Point Name) level, or none at all.

3. **Handling Across Network Nodes**: When the Overload Control feature is supported by the MME (Mobility Management Entity)/S4-SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and the SGW (Serving Gateway), and it is activated for the PLMN to which the PGW (Packet Data Network Gateway) belongs, specific procedures are followed:
   - The MME/S4-SGSN includes its identity towards the SGW during PDN connection establishment, mobility changes, and dedicated bearer procedures.
   - The SGW forwards the MME/S4-SGSN identifier to the PGW if received in Create/Update/Delete Bearer Response messages. For other GTP-C messages, the SGW stores the identity and includes it in subsequent Modify Bearer Request messages over the S5/S8 interface.
   - The PGW stores the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN identity to reduce PGW initiated signaling messages during an overload situation at the serving MME/S4-SGSN.

These procedures ensure that the PGW is updated with the identity of the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN during inter-MME/SGSN mobility scenarios, minimizing the risk of incorrect signaling throttling during overload situations.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The parameters involved in Overload Control Information as per table 12.3.5.1.3-1.
  - How the GTP-C entity determines the use of the Overload Control feature based on operator's policy and local configurations.
  - The specific procedures for including and forwarding the MME/S4-SGSN identity during signaling processes, and the implications for PGW initiated signaling during overload situations."
"Describe the constraints and requirements for 3GP files conforming to the Extended-presentation profile, including how media files and scene descriptions are addressed within the file.","3GP files conforming to the Extended-presentation profile, branded as '3ge9', must adhere to several constraints and requirements. Firstly, compact sample sizes ('stz2') are prohibited for tracks containing H.263, AMR, AMR-WB, AAC, or Timed text.

The Meta box of a 3GP file serves as a container for files that logically shadow files outside the 3GP file. The Movie box ('moov') contains all media tracks and possible scene description update tracks. The scene description addresses other resources using relative URLs, referring to media files by their filenames and media tracks by the relative URL '#box=moov'. Individual media tracks can be addressed by their track IDs using the format '#box=moov;track_ID=track-number', where track-number is a digit or a list of digits. For example, '#box=moov;track_ID=1,3' references tracks 1 and 3. Scene updates can also be addressed using these URL forms, such as applying updates to the scene description stored in track 1 after 10 seconds with '<updates xlink:href=\","The answer should include the following key details:

Describe the deregistration and handover procedures for a Mobile Station (MS) in GAN A/Gb mode as defined in 3GPP TS 44.318.,"The deregistration and handover procedures for a Mobile Station (MS) in GAN A/Gb mode as defined in 3GPP TS 44.318 involve several steps and actions from both the MS and the network components.

1. **Deregistration Procedure:**
   - **Initiated by the MS:** The MS should attempt to perform the deregistration procedure before leaving the Access Point (AP). This involves sending a deregistration request to the network.
   - **Initiated by the Network:** Optionally, the network can also initiate the deregistration of an MS. This involves the network sending a deregistration command to the MS.

2. **Circuit Switched (CS) Handover:**
   - **Actions by the GANC:** Upon successfully completing the CS handover from GAN A/Gb mode, the GAN Controller (GANC) should release all radio resources associated with the GAN connection.
   - **Actions by the MS:** Upon successfully completing the CS handover, the MS shall switch to the target radio access technology (e.g., GERAN) mode, detach the GA-RR entity from the RR-SAP, and enter the GA-RC-REGISTERED state. The MS may optionally deregister from the GANC either immediately after the handover or after sending the GA-CSR RELEASE COMPLETE message in response to the GA-CSR RELEASE message from the GANC.

3. **Packet Switched (PS) Handover:**
   - **Initiation by the MS:** The procedure for PS handover from a GAN A/Gb mode cell is started upon reception of the GA-PSR HANDOVER COMMAND message from the GANC. The MS then switches to GERAN/UTRAN mode, enters the GA-RC-REGISTERED state, and may either deregister from GAN A/Gb mode or consider the GA-PSR Transport Channel as implicitly released.
   - **Source GANC Perspective:** The procedure is initiated upon receiving a GA-PSR HANDOVER INFORMATION message from the MS and deciding to perform PS handover to a GERAN/UTRAN cell. It is completed when the SGSN instructs the GANC to delete the packet flow contexts corresponding to the MS.
   - **Target BSS/RNC Perspective:** The procedure is initiated upon receiving a PS Handover Request message (target BSS) or a Relocation Request message (target RNC) from the SGSN. It is completed upon receiving confirmation from the MS that it has arrived in the target cell.

These procedures ensure seamless transition and resource management during handover and deregistration processes in GAN A/Gb mode.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The steps involved in the deregistration procedure initiated by the MS and the network.

Describe the process and messages involved in activating and deactivating EMMI in a mobile station (MS) according to 3GPP TS 44.014.,"Activating EMMI in a mobile station (MS) requires the presence of a test SIM and can be initiated by switching on the MS, inserting a test SIM, or sending a layer 3 message on the radio interface (ACT_EMMI_CMD). When the MS is ready to receive frames, it sends an XON message. The ACT_EMMI_CMD message, which is sent from the SS to the MS, includes parameters such as channel coding (CHC), loop mechanism, and timeslot number (TN). Channel coding can be either '00' for no channel coding needed (type G) or '01' for channel coding needed (type H). The loop mechanism can be '000' for Multi-slot mechanism 1 or '001' for Multi-slot mechanism 2. If Multi-slot mechanism 1 is indicated, the TN field specifies the timeslot number, ranging from 0 to 7.

The activation command ACT_EMMI_CMD must be acknowledged by the MS with the ACT_EMMI_ACK message, which is sent from the MS to the SS. This acknowledgment message includes similar parameters such as channel coding, loop mechanism, and an error indication (Error Ind). The error indication can be '0' if the Multi-slot TCH loop was closed successfully or '1' if it was not closed due to an error.

EMMI can be deactivated by switching off the MS, removing the test SIM, or sending a layer 3 message on the radio interface (DEACT_EMMI). The DEACT_EMMI message, which is sent from the SS to the MS, does not require an acknowledgment. No XOF message is sent after deactivation.","The answer should cover the conditions required to activate and deactivate EMMI, the specific messages involved (ACT_EMMI_CMD, DEACT_EMMI, ACT_EMMI_ACK), their directions, and the parameters included in these messages such as channel coding, loop mechanism, timeslot number, and error indication."

Describe the key elements and architecture of the 3GP-DASH system as specified in the 3GPP TS 26.247 documents.,"The 3GP-DASH system, as specified in the 3GPP TS 26.247 documents, is designed to provide streaming services over HTTP. It is based on MPEG-DASH (ISO/IEC 23009-1) with some extensions and primarily defines two formats: Media Presentation Description (MPD) and Segment formats.

The Media Presentation Description (MPD) describes a Media Presentation, which can be either bounded or unbounded. It defines formats to announce resource identifiers for Segments and provides the context for these resources within a Media Presentation. The resource identifiers are exclusively HTTP-URLs, possibly combined with a byte range.

Segment formats specify the formats of the entity body of the HTTP response to an HTTP GET request or an HTTP partial GET request with the indicated byte range through HTTP/1.1. Segments typically contain efficiently coded media data and metadata aligned with common media formats.

The 3GP-DASH client accesses the MPD and uses the information provided to request Segments from an HTTP server. The client then demultiplexes, decodes, and renders the included media streams to provide a streaming service to the user. The specification does not provide a normative definition for the client but offers an informative client model and example client behavior description.

The system architecture for 3GP-DASH, illustrated in Figure 7-1, shows the interaction between the client and server. Solid line boxes indicate devices that host or process the formats defined in the specification, while dashed boxes are conceptual or transparent.

The logical components of the 3GP-DASH client model, shown in Figure 7-2, include the DASH Access Engine, which receives the MPD, constructs and issues requests, and receives Segments or parts of Segments. The output of the DASH Access Engine consists of media in container formats according to the ISO/IEC 14496-12 ISO Base Media File Format and specifically the 3GP file format. Timing information is also provided to map the internal timing of the media to the timeline of the Media Presentation.

Normative aspects of 3GP-DASH formats are defined by the profiles, DASH Media Presentation, and the usage of the 3GPP file format for DASH. These aspects may refer to Quality-of-Experience, normative Annexes, and ISO/IEC 23009-1.","The answer should cover the following key points:

Describe the process of generating and decoding the Gaussian noise excitation in WB mode as per 3GPP TS 26.445 specifications.,"The process of generating and decoding the Gaussian noise excitation in WB mode as per 3GPP TS 26.445 specifications involves several steps. Firstly, the Gaussian noise excitation is a second excitation added to the first innovative excitation from the algebraic codebook, and it is computed and added only in WB mode. The Gaussian noise excitation is produced by calling a random generator three times with a uniform distribution between -1 and +1, following the Central Limit Theorem. This Gaussian noisy excitation is then spectrally shaped by applying the pre-filter defined in subclause 5.2.3.4.1.1.

In WB mode, the decoding process involves generating an additional Gaussian noise excitation as described in subclause 5.2.3.4.2. The quantized algebraic codeword gain and Gaussian noise excitation gain are decoded. The quantized gain in dB is calculated, and the quantization index (5 bits for the algebraic codeword gain and 2 bits for the Gaussian noise excitation gain) is retrieved from the bitstream. The predicted algebraic codevector energy is decoded for the whole frame prior to calculating the algebraic codebook gain in each subframe.

The total excitation in each subframe is constructed by combining the pre-filtered algebraic codevector and the pre-filtered Gaussian noise excitation. Only the algebraic codevector is used to update the contents of the adaptive codebook for the next frame. The excitation signal is then post-processed to form the updated excitation signal, which is finally used as input to the synthesis filter. This post-processing step is described in subclause 6.1.1.3.","The answer should include the process of generating the Gaussian noise excitation, including the use of a random generator and the application of the pre-filter. It should also cover the decoding process in WB mode, including the calculation and retrieval of quantized gains from the bitstream. Additionally, the answer should describe the construction of the total excitation in each subframe and the post-processing of the excitation signal before synthesis."
"Describe the feasibility and implications of implementing multi-carrier operations in both uplink and downlink for mobile stations, considering the constraints and requirements outlined in the 3GPP TS 45.912 document.","The feasibility of implementing multi-carrier operations in both uplink and downlink for mobile stations involves several considerations and constraints as outlined in the 3GPP TS 45.912 document.

Firstly, multi-carrier operations are most feasible for the downlink, as indicated in Document 2. This is because receiving more effective downlink time slots in a shorter period allows for increased uplink data rates. However, applying multi-carrier operations to the uplink depends on mobile station (MS) implementation constraints, which require further study.

Document 3 highlights the requirement for a second transmitter and possibly a second transmit antenna for dual carrier operations in the uplink. This additional hardware is necessary to avoid insertion loss and ensure efficient transmission. Document 5 further elaborates on the need for a second transmit antenna to isolate both transmitters and avoid insertion loss due to a combiner. It suggests that advanced antenna designs, such as dual polarized antennas, could be used to facilitate both Rx diversity and dual carrier transmission.

The efficiency of the MS transmitter has a significant impact on the design, size, and battery life of the mobile station, as discussed in Document 4. The entire transmission path needs to be duplicated, which may increase power consumption, especially in idle mode. The document compares peak power consumption for different options and notes that insertion losses could further increase power consumption.

For type 1 MS, which cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, there are limitations on the number of uplink timeslots that can be supported, as described in Document 6. Type 1 MS can realistically support up to 6 uplink timeslots if one timeslot is needed for the downlink. For applications requiring high data rates in both uplink and downlink, such as bidirectional video telephony, a type 2 MS (full-duplex) or a MS supporting dual carrier in the uplink would be necessary.

In summary, while multi-carrier operations in the downlink are feasible and beneficial for increasing uplink data rates, implementing these operations in the uplink requires additional hardware and careful consideration of power consumption and design constraints. The feasibility of dual carrier transmission in small handsets is limited, but advanced antenna designs and component re-use could mitigate some challenges. The implications for various applications depend on the specific requirements for uplink and downlink data rates and the type of mobile station used.","The answer should cover the feasibility of multi-carrier operations in both uplink and downlink, including the constraints and requirements for mobile stations. It should discuss the impact on uplink data rates, the need for additional hardware such as a second transmitter and antenna, power consumption considerations, and the limitations for different types of mobile stations. The answer should also address the potential benefits and challenges of implementing these features in small handsets and the implications for various applications."
"Describe the energy saving mechanisms in 3GPP networks, focusing on both intra-RAT and inter-RAT scenarios. How do these mechanisms contribute to reducing operational expenses for mobile operators?","The primary objective of energy saving in 3GPP networks is to reduce operational expenses (OPEX) for mobile operators by lowering power consumption. This has become increasingly important and challenging due to the higher number of network elements in NR (New Radio), such as small cells with massive MIMO in higher frequency bands, compared to those used in LTE.

Intra-RAT energy saving involves scenarios where capacity boosters, such as gNB (Next Generation NodeB), are switched off when traffic demand is low and reactivated as needed. This can occur when the capacity booster cell is fully or partially overlaid by candidate cells. By managing the activation and deactivation of these capacity boosters based on traffic demand, mobile operators can significantly reduce power consumption and thus operational expenses.

Inter-RAT energy saving focuses on scenarios where LTE eNB (Evolved NodeB) provides basic coverage, while gNB acts as a capacity booster that can be switched off based on its own cell load information or by MnS (Management and Service) producer(s). In this scenario, the LTE eNB is allowed to activate the dormant capacity booster NR cell when needed. The decision-making process for energy saving in inter-RAT scenarios is centralized in the MnS producer, which makes it similar to intra-RAT energy saving, with the main difference being that the candidate cells are eNB.

Both intra-RAT and inter-RAT energy saving mechanisms contribute to reducing OPEX by optimizing power consumption based on real-time traffic demands and network conditions, ensuring that energy is used efficiently and only when necessary.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The primary objective of energy saving in mobile networks, which is to reduce operational expenses (OPEX) for mobile operators.
  - Description of intra-RAT energy saving, including the scenario of switching off capacity boosters when traffic demand is low and reactivating them as needed.
  - Explanation of inter-RAT energy saving, where LTE eNB provides basic coverage and gNB acts as a capacity booster that can be switched off based on cell load information or by MnS producer(s).
  - The centralized decision-making process in inter-RAT energy saving and how it compares to intra-RAT energy saving."
"Describe the test purpose, conformance requirements, and test procedure for UE in manual network selection mode with OPLMN cells available on NR and E-UTRA.","The test purpose for UE in manual network selection mode with OPLMN cells available on NR and E-UTRA involves two scenarios. First, when the user selects an OPLMN, the UE selects the highest priority RAT for the OPLMN, attempts to attach to the selected cell, and upon successful registration, indicates the PLMN to the user. Second, when the user selects an OPLMN and RAT combination, the UE attempts to attach to the selected OPLMN and RAT combination, and upon successful registration, indicates the PLMN to the user.

The conformance requirements reference TS 23.122 clause 4.4.3.1.2. These requirements specify the criteria for PLMN indication, including forbidden PLMNs and access technologies. The PLMNs are presented in a specific order: HPLMN or EHPLMN, user-controlled PLMN selector with access technology, operator-controlled PLMN selector with access technology, other PLMN/access technology combinations with high-quality signals, and other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing signal quality. The user can select their desired PLMN, and the MS initiates registration using the chosen access technology or the highest priority available access technology for that PLMN. The MS implementation may optionally indicate access technologies to the user.

The test description outlines the pre-test conditions, including the system simulator and cell configurations. Three cells are used: NR Cell 1 and NR Cell 12, configured as specified in TS 38.508-1, and E-UTRA Cell 1, defined in TS 36.508. The HPLMN is PLMN1, and USIM configuration 13 is used. The preamble conditions involve the UE being attached to PLMN1 and set to manual PLMN selection mode before being switched off. The test procedure sequence includes cell configuration changes over time, with specific power levels applied at various time instants. The main behavior description details the steps and conditions during the test execution.","The answer should cover the test purpose by explaining the scenarios where the UE is in manual network selection mode with OPLMN cells available on NR and E-UTRA. It should detail the steps the UE takes when the user selects an OPLMN or an OPLMN and RAT combination, including the registration process and indication to the user. The conformance requirements should reference TS 23.122 clause 4.4.3.1.2 and describe the criteria for PLMN indication, the order of PLMN presentation, and the user selection process. The test description should outline the pre-test conditions, including system simulator and cell configurations, UE settings, and USIM configuration. It should also describe the preamble conditions and the test procedure sequence, including cell configuration changes over time and the main behavior description."
"Describe the mechanisms and requirements for feature negotiation in 3GPP 5G APIs, including handling unsupported query parameters and indirect communication with delegated discovery.","Feature negotiation in 3GPP 5G APIs involves several mechanisms and requirements to ensure compatibility and support for optional features between NF Service Consumers and NF Service Producers. The SupportedFeatures data type plays a crucial role in this process, allowing both parties to indicate and negotiate the features they support.

For APIs that define resources, the NF Service Consumer includes the SupportedFeatures attribute in HTTP PUT or POST requests to create resources, indicating the optional features it supports. The NF Service Producer then compares these features with its own supported features and includes the SupportedFeatures attribute in the response, confirming the creation of the resource and the supported features. Similarly, for HTTP GET requests, the NF Service Consumer may include a query parameter indicating supported features, and the NF Service Producer responds with the supported features for the requested resources.

Handling unsupported query parameters is specified differently for safe and non-safe HTTP methods. For safe methods like HTTP GET, the NF Service Producer can either ignore unsupported query parameters and respond based on the rest of the request or reject the request if it becomes too large. For non-safe methods, the NF Service Producer rejects the request with a 400 Bad Request status, including a ProblemDetails IE that specifies the unsupported query parameters and lists the supported features.

Indirect communication with delegated discovery introduces additional requirements. The NF Service Consumer cannot discover supported features via the NRF and must include the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-required-features header in HTTP PUT or POST requests to specify required features. If no NF Service Producer supporting these features can be discovered, the SCP rejects the request with a 400 Bad Request status and the protocol error NF_DISCOVERY_FAILURE.

Additionally, NF instances should register all supported features to the NRF, enabling NF Service Consumers to discover NF Service Producers that support specific features. This registration also applies to default notification subscriptions, ensuring that supported features are considered for related notifications.

Overall, these mechanisms and requirements ensure effective feature negotiation and compatibility in 3GPP 5G APIs, facilitating seamless communication and service discovery between network functions.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The use of the SupportedFeatures data type for negotiating optional features in 5G APIs.
  - The process for feature negotiation using HTTP PUT, POST, and GET requests.
  - The handling of unsupported query parameters in HTTP requests, including the response behavior for safe and non-safe HTTP methods.
  - The additional requirements for feature negotiation in indirect communication with delegated discovery, including the use of the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-required-features header and handling discovery failures.
  - The registration of supported features to the NRF for enabling NF Service Consumers to discover NF Service Producers supporting specific features."
Describe the procedures and requirements for IP transport over the IuCS interface as outlined in the relevant 3GPP documents.,"The procedures and requirements for IP transport over the IuCS interface involve several key steps and interactions between the MSC server, MGW, and RNC. 

Firstly, if the MSC server supports IuCS on IP, the core network side procedures described in the relevant clauses of 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 23.231 shall apply. The MSC server initiates the access bearer assignment by requesting the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. During this process, the MSC server requests the MGW to provide an IP Transport Address and a Iu UDP Port, and it provides the MGW with the bearer characteristics. For speech calls, the MSC server provides the MGW with speech coding information and conditionally GTT related information as per 3GPP TS 23.226. For non-speech calls, the MSC server provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability.

Once the MGW replies with the IP address and UDP Port, the MSC server requests access bearer assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413. The IP addresses and UDP Ports of the MGW and the RNC are exchanged via RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is IP and the IuUP mode is Transparent, the MSC server sends the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure upon receiving the RANAP RAB assignment response.

For IuUP mode Support, the MGW uses the source IP address and UDP Port of the IuUP Init packet received from the radio access network as the destination address for subsequent downlink packets.

Additionally, the MSC Server and CS-MGW must act in accordance with clause 6.1.3 in 3GPP TS 23.205 and apply the coding standards as per 3GPP TS 29.232.

These procedures ensure proper handling of IP transport over the IuCS interface, including the exchange of necessary IP addresses and UDP ports, and compliance with relevant 3GPP standards.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the MSC server and MGW in preparing and assigning access bearers using IP transport.

"Describe the requirements for configuration, performance, and fault management in 3GPP systems, and explain the mechanisms for uploading and downloading configuration management data as specified in the relevant 3GPP documents.","In 3GPP systems, the requirements for configuration, performance, and fault management are specified in various technical documents. For configuration management purposes, the requirements from either 3GPP TS 32.601 clause 4 or 3GPP TS 32.611 clause 4.3 shall apply. These requirements include efficient mechanisms to upload current configuration management (CM) data from the IRP Agent and download new CM data to the IRP Agent. The file format for these operations must be standardized, machine-readable, and human-readable, typically using XML. The IRP Agent must be capable of making necessary configuration changes in its managed network elements (NEs) using the parameters and information contained in the transferred CM file.

For performance management purposes, the requirements from 3GPP TS 32.411 clauses 4 and 5 shall apply. These clauses outline the necessary metrics and data collection methods to ensure optimal network performance.

For fault management purposes, the requirements from 3GPP TS 32.111-1 clauses 4 and 5 shall apply. These clauses specify the procedures for detecting, reporting, and resolving faults within the network.

The mechanisms for uploading and downloading CM data over Interface-N include the ability to initiate uploads and downloads, scope the objects to be transferred, and activate configuration files in the network elements. Two activation modes are defined: one that minimizes impact on network services and another that implements changes as quickly as possible. The IRP Agent must log all activation operations, including successful and unsuccessful commands, and support notifications for various operations and error cases. Security considerations include ensuring that only the IRP Manager who initiated a session can send commands related to that session, maintaining a log of sessions, and generating security alarms if unauthorized changes are detected.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - Configuration management requirements from TS 32.601 clause 4 or TS 32.611 clause 4.3.
  - Performance management requirements from TS 32.411 clauses 4 and 5.
  - Fault management requirements from TS 32.111-1 clauses 4 and 5.

Describe the different types of RLC PDUs and their specific uses in 3GPP TS 38.322.,"In 3GPP TS 38.322, RLC PDUs are categorized into RLC data PDUs and RLC control PDUs. RLC data PDUs are used by TM, UM, and AM RLC entities to transfer upper layer PDUs, known as RLC SDUs. Specifically, there are three types of RLC data PDUs: TMD PDU, UMD PDU, and AMD PDU. The TMD PDU is used by the TM RLC entity to transfer upper layer PDUs. The UMD PDU is used by the UM RLC entity for the same purpose. The AMD PDU is utilized by the AM RLC entity to transfer upper layer PDUs.

On the other hand, RLC control PDUs are used by the AM RLC entity to perform ARQ procedures. The primary type of RLC control PDU is the STATUS PDU. The STATUS PDU is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity to inform the peer AM RLC entity about the RLC data PDUs that have been successfully received and those that are detected to be lost. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring reliable communication.","The answer should include the categorization of RLC PDUs into data and control PDUs. It should detail the specific types of RLC data PDUs (TMD PDU, UMD PDU, AMD PDU) and their uses by TM, UM, and AM RLC entities.

"Describe the different SRNS relocation procedures between 3G_MSC entities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.009, including scenarios with and without circuit connections.","The SRNS (Serving Radio Network Subsystem) relocation procedures between 3G_MSC (Mobile Switching Center) entities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 involve several scenarios, both requiring and not requiring circuit connections.

1. **Inter-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation with Circuit Connection (Document 1)**:
   - The procedure for successful Inter-3G_MSC SRNS relocation requiring a circuit connection is illustrated in figure 30.
   - The initiation of the relocation procedure is described in clause 5, utilizing messages from TS 25.413 and the transport mechanism from MAP (TS 29.002).
   - After an Inter-3G_MSC SRNS relocation, further Intra-3G_MSC relocations may occur on 3G_MSC-B, following the procedures specified in previous clauses.

2. **Basic SRNS Relocation without Circuit Connection (Document 2)**:
   - The basic SRNS relocation procedures when no circuit connection is required by 3G_MSC-A are similar to those for circuit-switched calls described in clause 8.3.1.
   - Differences include the establishment of circuits between network entities and the Handover Number allocation.
   - 3G_MSC-A specifies to 3G_MSC-B that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.
   - The IU-RELOC-REQUEST is transmitted with the identity of the target RNS, and subsequent Handover Number allocation procedures are not invoked until the completion of the basic relocation procedure.
   - Figure 31 illustrates the basic SRNS relocation procedure without a circuit connection, highlighting the omission of circuit establishment messaging and handover number allocation signaling.

3. **Subsequent Relocation from 3G_MSC-B to 3G_MSC-A with Circuit Connection (Document 3)**:
   - The procedure for successful relocation from 3G_MSC-B back to 3G_MSC-A using a circuit connection is shown in figure 32.

4. **Subsequent Relocation from 3G_MSC-B to 3G_MSC-B' with Circuit Connection (Document 4)**:

Explain the process and macros involved in transferring subscriber data to the VLR and SGSN as per 3GPP TS 29.002 specifications.,"The process of transferring subscriber data to the Visitor Location Register (VLR) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) involves several steps and the use of specific macros and processes defined in the 3GPP TS 29.002 specifications.

For transferring subscriber data to the VLR, the Home Location Register (HLR) uses the macro defined in clause 19.5.1. This macro is part of an existing dialogue for location updating or data restoration. The HLR may either wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before sending the next request or handle the requests and confirmations in parallel. The macro Wait_For_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf (defined in clause 25.7.5) is used to handle the transfer of subscriber data, and the process Send_Insert_Subs_Data_HLR (defined in clause 25.7.7) is used to send the MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.

If the VLR indicates that it does not support a service or feature that the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_For_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit. The HLR then sets the Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends this information in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request. If the unsupported service or feature is not considered essential, the HLR sends data for a replacement service in a subsequent request.

For CAMEL Phase 2 or later services, the HLR must ensure that the VLR supports the appropriate phase to avoid unpredictable or incorrect service behavior. The HLR should send a Forwarded-to number in non-E.164 international format to the VLR only if it has confirmed that the VLR supports CAMEL Phase 2 or later.

Similarly, for transferring subscriber data to the SGSN, the HLR uses the macro defined in clause 19.5.2. This macro is part of an existing dialogue for location updating. The HLR may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before sending the next request or handle the requests and confirmations in parallel. The macro Wait_For_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf (defined in clause 25.7.5) is used to handle the transfer of subscriber data, and the process Send_Insert_Subs_Data_HLR (defined in clause 25.7.7) is used to send the MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.

If the SGSN indicates that it does not support a service or feature that the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_For_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit. The HLR then sets the Roaming Restricted In SGSN Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends this information in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request. If the unsupported service or feature is not considered essential, the HLR sends data for a replacement service in a subsequent request.

In summary, the HLR plays a crucial role in transferring subscriber data to the VLR and SGSN, using specific macros and processes to handle the requests and acknowledgments, manage unsupported features, and ensure compatibility with CAMEL Phase 2 or later services.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of the HLR in transferring subscriber data to the VLR and SGSN.

Describe the behavior and process of the post-processing module during sampling rate switching as per 3GPP TS 26.445 specifications.,"During sampling rate switching, the post-processing module described in clause 6.1.4 of 3GPP TS 26.445 exhibits specific behavior to ensure smooth transitions. The decoded signal is conveyed to several post-processing blocks, starting with adaptive post-filtering to enhance the formant and harmonic structure of the signal, followed by a bass-post-filter that treats the low frequencies.

The adaptive post-filtering process involves a cascade of three filters: a long-term post-filter, a short-term post-filter, and a tilt compensation filter, followed by an adaptive gain control procedure. The post-filter coefficients are updated in every subframe. The reconstructed signal is inverse-filtered to produce the residual signal, which is used to compute the delay and gain of the long-term post-filter. The signal is then filtered through the long-term post-filter and the synthesis filter, and finally passed through the tilt compensation filter to generate the post-filtered reconstructed signal. Adaptive gain control is applied to match its energy to the original signal.

The long-term post-filter is only applied for Narrowband (NB) modes and is bypassed for Wideband (WB) and Super Wideband (SWB) modes, where the post-filtering consists of only the short-term post-filter and the tilt compensation filter, followed by adaptive gain control. At 9.6 kbit/s NB decoding, the long-term post-filter is active only for clean speech when the background noise level is less than 20 dB and is deactivated for Unvoiced Coding (UC) mode.

Overall, the post-processing module ensures that the transition during sampling rate switching is handled effectively by adapting the filtering process based on the mode and conditions of the signal.","The answer should include the specific behavior of the post-processing module during sampling rate switching, as described in clause 6.3.4.6. It should also cover the detailed process of adaptive post-filtering, including the types of filters used (long-term, short-term, tilt compensation), the conditions under which each filter is applied (NB, WB, SWB modes), and the adaptive gain control procedure. Additionally, it should mention the specific conditions for the activation and deactivation of the long-term post-filter at 9.6 kbit/s NB decoding."
"Describe the process and responsibilities involved in sending a USSD request or notification from the HLR and VLR to an MS, including the role of the MSC in forwarding operations.","The process of sending a USSD request or notification from the HLR (Home Location Register) and VLR (Visitor Location Register) to an MS (Mobile Station) involves several steps and responsibilities:

1. **HLR's Responsibilities:**
   - When an application in the HLR needs to send a USSD request or notification to an MS, it sets up a transaction to the VLR where the subscriber is currently registered and sends the operation to the VLR.
   - The HLR controls the transaction and typically releases it upon receiving a response from the VLR. However, the HLR may also release the transaction before receiving a response if necessary, such as when an application timer expires.
   - If further operations are needed for the same MS as part of the same application, the HLR may continue using the same transaction until all operations are completed. If a different transaction is required for subsequent operations, the HLR releases the first transaction before starting the next.
   - If the VLR releases the transaction at any time (e.g., due to user clearing), the HLR informs the application and terminates the USSD operation.

2. **VLR's Responsibilities:**
   - The VLR may receive a USSD operation from the HLR at any time. If the subscriber can be contacted, the VLR sets up a transaction to the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) and forwards the operation unchanged.
   - The VLR controls the transaction and typically releases it upon receiving a response from the MSC. The VLR may also release the transaction before receiving a response if necessary, such as when an application timer expires.
   - If further operations are needed for the same MS as part of the same application, the VLR may continue using the same transaction until all operations are completed. If a different transaction is required for subsequent operations, the VLR releases the first transaction before starting the next.
   - If the MSC releases the transaction at any time (e.g., due to user clearing), the VLR informs the application and terminates the USSD operation.

3. **MSC's Responsibilities:**
   - The MSC may receive a USSD operation from the VLR at any time. If the subscriber can be contacted, the MSC sets up a transaction to the MS and forwards the operation unchanged.
   - Any further information exchange between the VLR and MS is transparent to the MSC.
   - When one transaction is released, the MSC releases the other.

In summary, the HLR initiates and controls transactions to the VLR, the VLR forwards USSD operations to the MSC and controls transactions, and the MSC forwards USSD operations to the MS while ensuring transparency in further information exchanges. Transactions are released by the HLR, VLR, and MSC based on responses or specific conditions such as timer expiry or user clearing.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - The HLR's responsibility in initiating and controlling transactions to the VLR, including the conditions for releasing transactions.
  - The VLR's role in forwarding USSD operations to the MSC and its responsibility in controlling transactions.
  - The MSC's role in forwarding USSD operations to the MS and ensuring transparency in further information exchanges.
  - The process of handling multiple operations within the same transaction by both HLR and VLR.
  - The conditions under which transactions are released by HLR, VLR, and MSC."
Describe the role and behavior of MCData gateway servers in the context of local policy enforcement as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282.,"MCData gateway servers play a crucial role in the communication between MCData functions that reside in different trust domains. As specified in 3GPP TS 24.282, these servers are inserted in the path between MCData systems to manage and control the flow of data. The behavior of MCData gateway servers includes acting as exit points from one MCData system and entry points into another, ensuring that local policies are enforced during the data transfer process.

Local policies enforcement by MCData gateway servers covers a wide range of actions, which are left to implementation specifics. One example of local policy enforcement is when an MCData gateway server, acting as an exit point, receives a SIP request or response containing sensitive information that should not be exposed to the interconnected system. In such cases, the gateway server can remove the sensitive information from the outgoing SIP message before forwarding it, ensuring compliance with local policies without hindering the delivery of the service. This mechanism helps maintain the integrity and security of the data being transferred between different trust domains.","The answer should cover the insertion of MCData gateway servers between MCData functions in different trust domains, their role as exit and entry points, and the enforcement of local policies. It should include an example of local policy enforcement, such as the removal of sensitive information from SIP messages by the MCData gateway server."
"Describe the security mechanisms for protecting IMS traffic in 3GPP TS 33.328, including the protocols used for real-time traffic and session-based messaging, and the key management mechanisms involved.","In 3GPP TS 33.328, several security mechanisms are outlined for protecting IMS traffic. 

Firstly, SDES (Session Description Protocol Security Descriptions) requires SIP messages carrying SDES crypto attributes to be secured, as SDES itself does not provide any security mechanism. SIP messages within IMS are secured in a hop-by-hop fashion using IPsec and TLS, as defined in TS 33.203. Outside IMS, hop-by-hop TLS as specified in RFC 3261 is likely to be supported. It is crucial to protect SIP proxies because the keys transported with SDES become visible in plaintext on these proxies, which could compromise both signalling and media security if the proxies are compromised. However, SIP proxies are generally trusted for securing SIP signalling, which is an important requirement for operators and users.

For real-time traffic, protection for IMS traffic using RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) and RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) is achieved by using SRTP (Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol) and SRTCP (Secure RTCP Protocol) respectively, as defined in RFC 3711. Compliant implementations must support the default transforms and key derivation functions defined in SRTP, with additional transforms and key derivation functions optionally supported. Annex C and Annex O provide further profiling of SRTP for compliant implementations.

For session-based messaging, protection for IMS traffic using MSRP (Message Session Relay Protocol) is achieved by TLS protection, as defined in RFC 4975 and RFC 6714. 

Key management mechanisms for SRTP, SRTCP, and MSRP are described in clause 6.2 of the specification. These mechanisms are responsible for providing SRTP master key(s) and master salt(s), ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of IMS traffic.","The answer must include the following key details:

What are the requirements for ANR management in NG-RAN and E-UTRAN as specified in 3GPP documents TS 28.313 and TS 32.511?,"The requirements for ANR (Automatic Neighbor Relation) management in NG-RAN and E-UTRAN are detailed in 3GPP documents TS 28.313 and TS 32.511. 

According to TS 28.313, for NG-RAN ANR management, the initial status of a newly created Neighbor Cell Relation (NCR) by the ANR function to a NG-RAN cell must allow handover (HO), X2 or Xn connection setup, and the removal of the NCR by the ANR function in the gNB. Additionally, NG-RAN ANR management must support NCRs from NG-RAN to NG-RAN and from NG-RAN to E-UTRAN. For E-UTRAN ANR management, the initial status of a newly created NCR by the ANR function to a NG-RAN cell must allow HO, X2 connection setup, and the removal of the NCR by the ANR function in the eNB. E-UTRAN ANR management must also support NCRs from E-UTRAN to NG-RAN and other technologies as described in TS 32.511.

TS 32.511 specifies that NCRs should be set up and optimized with minimal human intervention. For E-UTRAN, the initial status of a newly created NCR by the ANR function must allow HO, X2 connection setup, and the removal of the NCR by the ANR function in the eNB. E-UTRAN ANR supports the management of NCRs from E-UTRAN to various technologies including E-UTRAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000, GERAN, and NG-RAN. For UTRAN, the initial status of a newly created NCR by the ANR function must allow HO and the removal of the NCR by the ANR function in the RNC.

Explain the conditions and actions related to the DPCCH2_TRANSMISSION variable in 3GPP TS 25.331.,"The DPCCH2_TRANSMISSION variable in 3GPP TS 25.331 is set to TRUE only when the following conditions are met: the UE is in CELL_DCH state, the UE has stored the IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD', and the variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to TRUE. If any of these conditions are not met and the DPCCH2_TRANSMISSION variable is set to TRUE, the UE must set the variable to FALSE, trigger lower layers to stop DPCCH2 transmission, and clear the stored IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD'. Conversely, if all conditions are met and the variable is set to FALSE, the UE must set the variable to TRUE and trigger lower layers to perform DPCCH2 transmission. Whenever the variable is set to TRUE, the UE must trigger lower layers to perform DPCCH2 transmission, and when set to FALSE, the UE must not perform DPCCH2 transmission.

Additionally, if the IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD' is included and the UE will be in CELL_DCH state after the procedure, the UE must store the IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD', replacing any previously stored IE, and store other related information if present. If the IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD' is not included and the UE has any stored IE 'DPCCH2 info FDD', the UE must clear the stored IE.

Describe the test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction with non-MBSFN ABS as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction with non-MBSFN ABS as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several steps and specific conditions. 

Initial conditions include setting up the test environment, which can be normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, or TH/VH, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 4.1. The frequencies to be tested are specified in Annex E table E-1 and 3GPP TS 36.508 clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1, with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz as defined in clause 4.3.1. 

The connection setup involves connecting the SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connectors as shown in 3GPP TS 36.508 Annex A figure A.54 (without faders). General test parameters are set according to Table 9.1.15.1.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0. Message contents are defined in clause 9.1.15.1.4.3.

Cell configuration includes Cell 1 as the serving cell and aggressor cell to Cell 3, Cell 2 as the neighbor aggressor cell without CRS colliding to Cell 3, and Cell 3 as the cell to be measured for RSRP absolute accuracy. Both Cell 1 and Cell 3 are measured for RSRP relative accuracy. Non-MBSFN ABS pattern is configured for Cell 1 and Cell 2 during the test, with Cell 1 used for connection setup and power levels set according to Annex C.0 and C.1.

The detailed step-by-step test procedure is as follows:
1. Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.3 with exceptions listed in clause 7.2A.6.
2. Set the parameters according to Tables 9.1.15.1.4.1-1 and Table 9.1.15.1.5-1. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.1.
3. SS shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. The UE shall transmit RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. UE shall transmit periodically MeasurementReport messages.
6. After 10 seconds from Step 3, SS shall check the reported RSRP values in periodical MeasurementReport messages. The reported RSRP values for Cell 3 are compared to the actual RSRP values according to Table 9.1.15.1.5-2. If the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 3, the number of failed iterations is increased by one.
7. SS shall check the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level according to Table G.2.3-1 in clause G.2 is achieved.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each sub-test in Table 9.1.15.1.5-1 as appropriate.

Message contents are according to 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.6 with specific exceptions listed in Tables 9.1.15.1.4.3-1 to 9.1.15.1.4.3-5, which include additional requirements for the RSRP TDD intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction with non-MBSFN ABS absolute accuracy test.","The answer should include the initial conditions and test environment setup, the frequencies and channel bandwidth to be tested, the connection setup and general test parameters, the propagation conditions, the configuration of serving and aggressor cells, and the detailed step-by-step test procedure.

"Describe the requirements and procedures for radio link monitoring in UE category 0 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521, TS 36.213, and TS 36.331.","The requirements and procedures for radio link monitoring in UE category 0 are detailed across several 3GPP specifications. According to TS 36.521, the UE category 0 must meet specific conditions for radio link monitoring when no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is used. The HD-FDD category 0 UE must adhere to the requirements specified in TS 36.133 clause 7.11.2.1, ensuring that at least one downlink (DL) subframe per radio frame of the primary cell (PCell) is available during the evaluation periods for Qin_Cat0 and Qout_Cat0.

When the downlink radio link quality of the PCell, estimated over the last 200 ms period, falls below the threshold Qout_Cat0, Layer 1 of the UE must send an out-of-sync indication to higher layers within the 200 ms Qout_Cat0 evaluation period. Conversely, if the downlink radio link quality improves beyond the threshold Qin_Cat0 over the last 100 ms period, Layer 1 must send an in-sync indication to higher layers within the 100 ms Qin_Cat0 evaluation period. Both out-of-sync and in-sync indications must be filtered through Layer 3 as specified in TS 36.331.

TS 36.213 further elaborates that the UE must monitor the downlink radio link quality of the PCell to indicate out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. If the UE is configured with a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) and the parameter rlf-TimersAndConstantsSCG is provided and not set to release, the UE must also monitor the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell of the SCG. In non-DRX mode, the physical layer in the UE must assess the radio link quality every radio frame, while in DRX mode, the assessment must occur at least once every DRX period. The assessments are based on thresholds Qout and Qin defined by relevant tests.

Additionally, if higher-layer signaling specifies certain subframes for restricted radio link monitoring, the radio link quality must not be monitored in any subframe other than those indicated. The physical layer must indicate out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than Qout and in-sync when it is better than Qin.

Finally, TS 36.331 specifies that the transmitter power of the UE must be turned off within 40 ms after the expiry of the T310 timer, ensuring efficient power management and compliance with the defined procedures.","The answer should include the specific conditions under which UE category 0 performs radio link monitoring, the thresholds for Qout_Cat0 and Qin_Cat0, the procedures for sending out-of-sync and in-sync indications, the frequency of assessments in non-DRX and DRX modes, the role of Layer 1 and Layer 3 filtering, and the transmitter power off timing after T310 timer expiry."
"How does the UE manage its uplink transmit power according to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications, particularly in relation to the 'Maximum allowed UL TX power' and internal measurement event 6d?","According to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications, the UE manages its uplink transmit power through a series of defined procedures and conditions.

Firstly, if the Information Element (IE) 'Maximum allowed UL TX power' is included in the Handover to UTRAN Command, any other dedicated message, or in System Information Block type 3 or 4, the UE is required to store and use this value until it is updated. If this IE is not included in any dedicated message, the UE should use the previously stored value from an earlier dedicated message, Handover to UTRAN Command message, or System Information Block type 3 or 4.

In all cases, the UE must ensure that its uplink transmit power does not exceed the indicated power value. If the current UE uplink transmit power is above the indicated power value, the UE must decrease the power to a level at or below the indicated value. The maximum UE TX power is defined as the lower of the maximum output power of the UE power class and the maximum allowed UL TX power indicated in the IE, and this maximum UE TX power must not be exceeded.

Regarding internal measurement event 6d, when this event is set up, the UE creates a variable TRIGGERED_6D_EVENT related to the measurement, initially set to FALSE, and deletes this variable when the measurement is released. When ordered by UTRAN in a measurement control message, if the UE Tx power equals the maximum power the UE can transmit (i.e., the maximum UE TX power reduced by the power reduction used by the UE for a time period indicated by the IE 'time_to_trigger'), and if the TRIGGERED_6D_EVENT variable is set to FALSE, the UE sets this variable to TRUE and sends a measurement report with specific IEs set accordingly. If the TRIGGERED_6D_EVENT variable is set to TRUE and the UE Tx power is less than the maximum UE TX power, the variable is set to FALSE.

The maximum UE TX power is defined in subclause 8.6.6.8, and the maximum allowed power reduction is defined in subclause 6.2.2. These procedures ensure that the UE manages its uplink transmit power effectively, adhering to the specified limits and conditions.","The answer should include:
- The process for storing and using the 'Maximum allowed UL TX power' value.
- Actions the UE must take if the current uplink transmit power exceeds the indicated power value.
- The definition of maximum UE TX power.
- Steps for setting up and managing the TRIGGERED_6D_EVENT variable.
- Conditions under which the UE sends a measurement report for event 6d.
- The relationship between UE Tx power and the maximum UE TX power, including references to relevant subclauses."
"Describe the registration and deregistration procedures involving the S-CSCF and HSS, including the handling of multiple registrations and restoration information.","The registration and deregistration procedures involving the Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) and Home Subscriber Server (HSS) are crucial for managing user identities and ensuring seamless service delivery in IMS networks. 

During the initial registration procedure, the S-CSCF sends a request to the HSS to register the IMS User Equipment (UE). This request includes the IMS UE's identity, which is typically an IMS Public User Identity (IMPU), along with the S-CSCF registration information and the registration type. The HSS then updates or creates the S-CSCF registration information based on the received data. If the resource already exists, the HSS updates it and responds with a status code indicating success (e.g., '200 OK' or '204 No Content'). If the resource does not exist, the HSS creates it and responds with '201 Created'. In case of errors, appropriate HTTP status codes such as '403 Forbidden' are returned.

Multiple registrations are identified by the presence of a 'reg-id' parameter in the Contact header of the SIP REGISTER message. When the S-CSCF detects this parameter, it indicates to the HSS that the registration is related to multiple registrations. The HSS then includes all relevant S-CSCF restoration information in its response. Restoration information is crucial for maintaining service continuity and is updated or retrieved based on the registration events.

The S-CSCF sends different types of Server Assignment Request (SAR) messages under various conditions:
- SAR with Server Assignment Type set to NO_ASSIGNMENT is sent to retrieve S-CSCF restoration information.
- SAR with Server Assignment Type set to RE_REGISTRATION is sent to update restoration information in the HSS.
- SAR with Server Assignment Type set to USER_DEREGISTRATION is sent during deregistration events.

Operator policies may influence whether certain steps, such as sending SAR with NO_ASSIGNMENT, are skipped if restoration information is already available.

During deregistration, the S-CSCF checks for the 'reg-id' parameter in the SIP REGISTER message. If it exists, the S-CSCF retrieves the restoration information and updates it accordingly. If the contact addresses do not match, the S-CSCF sends SAR with RE_REGISTRATION to update the HSS. Otherwise, it sends SAR with USER_DEREGISTRATION.

Overall, the procedures ensure that user identities are accurately registered and deregistered, and restoration information is properly managed to maintain service continuity.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The initial registration procedure and the roles of S-CSCF and HSS.
  - How multiple registrations are identified and handled.
  - The process for updating and retrieving restoration information.
  - Conditions under which the S-CSCF sends different types of SAR messages.
  - HTTP status codes and error handling during the registration process.
  - Specifics on restoration information updates and operator policies."
What are the supported content types and serialization protocols for HTTP bodies in 3GPP TS 29.598 and TS 29.500 specifications?,"The 3GPP TS 29.598 specification outlines several supported content types for HTTP bodies. These include JSON, which is used as the content type 'application/json' as specified in IETF RFC 8259. Additionally, 'Problem Details' JSON objects are used to indicate error details in HTTP response bodies, signalled by the content type 'application/problem+json' as defined in IETF RFC 7807. JSON Patch format is also supported for HTTP request bodies, signalled by the content type 'application/json-patch+json' as described in IETF RFC 6902. Multipart messages are supported and may indicate other content types as detailed in clause 6.1.2.4.

The 3GPP TS 29.500 specification further elaborates on the use of JSON format as a serialization protocol, as described in IETF RFC 8259. For transmitting large parts of opaque binary data along with JSON format, multipart messages are supported using the 'multipart/related' media type, 3gpp vendor specific content subtype, and cross-referencing from the JSON payload using the Content-ID field.","The answer should include the supported content types for HTTP bodies as specified in TS 29.598, including JSON, Problem Details JSON object, and JSON Patch.

Describe the procedures and requirements for modifying VAL group information and provisioning 5G LAN parameters using HTTP PUT/PATCH requests.,"To modify VAL group information, the VAL server must send an HTTP PUT message to the group management server at the Resource URI identifying the VAL group document resource representation. This request should not replace the valGroupId property in the existing resource. If the 'PatchUpdate' feature is supported, the VAL server may send an HTTP PATCH request to partially update the VAL group document. The body of the HTTP PATCH request must include the requested modifications.

Upon receiving the HTTP PUT message, the group management server must:
1. Verify the identity of the VAL server and check if it is authorized to modify VAL group information.
2. Ensure that the valGroupId in the request matches the valGroupId of the VAL group document resource.
3. If authorized and the valGroupId matches, the server will:
   a. Update the resource identified by the Resource URI with the group members list, group configuration information, description, VAL service identifiers, external group identifier, and location information.
   b. If the request includes 5G LAN-Type communication, invoke the 5GLANParameterProvision API towards the NEF via an HTTP PUT/PATCH message.
   c. Return a 200 OK status code with the updated VAL group document or a 204 No Content status code.

The URI query parameters, request and response data structures, and headers supported by the PUT and PATCH methods are specified in the relevant tables of the 3GPP TS 29.549 documentation.

For provisioning 5G LAN parameters, the AF must initiate an HTTP PUT/PATCH request to the NEF for the 'Individual 5GLAN Parameters Provision Subscription' resource. The body of the HTTP PUT message must include the 5GLanParametersProvision data type, while the HTTP PATCH message must include the 5GLanParametersProvisionPatch data. The External Group Identifier, DNN, S-NSSAI, and PDU session type(s) must remain unchanged.

Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT/PATCH message, if the AF is authorized, the NEF will interact with the UDM to modify an existing subscription using the Nudm_ParameterProvision service. If the UDM accepts the modification request, the NEF will update the subscription and send a HTTP response with a 200 OK status code including the 5GLanParametersProvision data structure or a 204 No Content status code.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The process for modifying VAL group information using HTTP PUT and PATCH requests, including the verification of VAL server identity and authorization, and the conditions under which the group management server updates the VAL group document.

What are the spurious emission power limits for base stations capable of multi-band operation according to 3GPP TS 25.142 and TS 25.105?,"The spurious emission power limits for base stations (BS) capable of multi-band operation are defined in several tables and subclauses within 3GPP TS 25.142 and TS 25.105. According to TS 25.142, the power of any spurious emission for multi-band BS should not exceed the values given in Table 7.12A. For BS with separate antenna connectors for different bands, the single-band requirements apply, and the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna connector. Additionally, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the levels specified for co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area, as detailed in subclauses 6.6.3.2.2.1 and 6.6.3.5.2.2.2.

In geographic areas where GSM DCS, UTRA, and/or E-UTRA BS are operating in other frequency bands, the spurious emission limits are provided in Table 6.31 of TS 25.142. The exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.31 apply for each supported operating band and for separate antenna connectors.

For areas with unsynchronized 1,28 Mcps UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD, the spurious emission limits are specified in Table 6.36B of TS 25.142. Similar exclusions and conditions apply for each supported operating band and separate antenna connectors.

TS 25.105 further specifies that the power of any spurious emission should not exceed the limit defined in Table 7.6A-1.

"Describe the functionalities and procedures related to Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) GSM Optimization, APN Rate Control, and PS Handover as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.060 documents.","Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) GSM Optimization provides support for Non-IP data, Non-IP data delivery using the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF), and APN Rate Control. 

Non-IP data support in CIoT EPS Optimisations allows devices to communicate without using traditional IP protocols, which can be beneficial for low-power, low-data-rate applications. This is detailed in clause 5.3.13.8 of the 3GPP TS 23.060 document.

Non-IP data delivery using SCEF is another feature of CIoT GSM Optimization. SCEF facilitates the delivery of Non-IP data by providing a standardized interface for network services, as referenced in TS 23.682.

APN Rate Control is a mechanism by which the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW), or SCEF can manage the data rate for a specific Access Point Name (APN). The GGSN/PDN GW/SCEF sends an APN Uplink Rate Control command to the Mobile Station (MS) using the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element. This command specifies the rate limit for data PDUs sent on that APN, and the MS must comply with this instruction until a new one is received. The GGSN, PDN GW, or SCEF may enforce this rate control by discarding or delaying packets that exceed the specified rate. This is detailed in clause 15.2.3.2 of the 3GPP TS 23.060 document.

The Packet-Switched (PS) Handover procedure is used to transfer an MS with one or more packet flows from a source cell to a target cell, particularly when at least one of the cells is a GERAN cell. During the handover, radio resources in the target cell are allocated and signaled to the MS, and system information needed for access in the target cell is provided. If the MS is using a Non-IP connection to a GGSN/PGW or a PDP Context to a SCEF, and these cannot be supported by the target SGSN, the source SGSN will release these bearers upon successful completion of the handover. If no other PDP Contexts can be transferred, a failure message is sent to the source RAN node. This procedure is detailed in clause 6.9.4 of the 3GPP TS 23.060 document.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Explanation of Non-IP data support in CIoT EPS Optimisations.

"Describe the procedures and state transitions involved in the establishment, maintenance, and termination of a broadcast call in a mobile station (MS) and network according to 3GPP TS 44.069.","The Broadcast Call Control (BCC) entity in a mobile station (MS) is described as an extended finite state machine that performs transitions between states based on interactions with higher and lower layers and message exchanges with its peer entity. It has configuration and behavior parameters that influence its actions.

To establish a broadcast call, higher layers in the MS may request the BCC entity in state U0 (NULL) to initiate the call using either the immediate set-up procedure or the set-up procedure. For the set-up procedure, the BCC entity builds a SETUP message, asks lower layers to establish an MM connection explicitly, and enters state U0.p (MM CONNECTION PENDING). Once the MM connection is established, it transitions to state U1 (BC INITIATED). For the immediate set-up procedure, the BCC entity builds an IMMEDIATE SETUP message, asks lower layers to establish an MM connection implicitly, sets timer TMM-est, and enters state U1.

The network BCC entity in state NULL may receive a SETUP or IMMEDIATE SETUP message from the MS, leading it to state N1 (BC INITIATED). The network then decides whether to accept or reject the establishment. If accepted, it activates resources and sends a CONNECT message to the MS, transitioning to state N2 (BC ACTIVE) or N3 (BC ESTABLISHMENT PROCEEDING) based on resource activation status.

During the active state, the BCC entity in the MS performs actions based on messages from its peer entity, requests from higher layers, and indications from lower layers. It can initiate abort or termination procedures, which are detailed in subclause 6.4. Similarly, the network BCC entity performs supervisory and maintenance functions and can initiate abort or termination procedures.

In state U6 (RECEIVE MODE ACTIVE), the BCC entity in the MS handles no channel availability by informing higher layers and starting timer Tno channel. If the timer expires, it aborts resources and enters the idle state. If a channel becomes available, it stops the timer and informs higher layers.

Termination procedures can be initiated by the MS or network at any time. The MS sends a TERMINATION REQUEST message and sets timer Tterm. The network responds with a TERMINATION or TERMINATION REJECT message. On Tterm expiry or receipt of a TERMINATION message, the MS aborts the broadcast call and returns to state U0. The network can also terminate the connection by sending a TERMINATION message specifying the cause and releasing associated resources.

Overall, the BCC entity in both the MS and network follows defined procedures and state transitions to manage the establishment, maintenance, and termination of broadcast calls.","The answer must include:
- Description of the BCC entity as an extended finite state machine and its role in state transitions.
- Procedures for establishing a broadcast call, including immediate set-up and set-up procedures, and the corresponding state transitions in the MS and network.

Explain the procedures and service parameters involved in the context transfer between MME and AMF nodes as defined in 3GPP TS 29.303 and TS 23.003.,"The context transfer procedures between old MME and new AMF, MME, or S4 SGSN are essential for maintaining seamless connectivity and service continuity during node transitions. These procedures are detailed in 3GPP TS 29.303 and involve several key steps and parameters.

Firstly, when a new AMF, MME, or S4 SGSN needs to contact the old MME, the primary use case is context transfer. The construction of the MME node Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is crucial in this process. According to TS 23.003 clause 19.4.2.2, the MME node FQDN is constructed using data obtained from the UE's old GUTI or mapped from old P-TMSI and old RAI. The FQDN can either be the canonical node name itself or an alias chosen by the operator.

The S-NAPTR procedure is used to discover interfaces based on the MME node FQDN. This procedure involves prefixing the query with specific service parameters to identify the required interfaces.

"Describe the charging event reporting process to the Charging Data Function (CDF), including the key elements and trigger conditions for different network components as specified in TS 32.253.","The charging event reporting process to the Charging Data Function (CDF) involves several key elements and trigger conditions for different network components. When a charging event is reported to the CDF, it includes details such as user identity, Charging Id, Access Point Name (APN), Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) address, Mobility Management Entity (MME) address, and in roaming scenarios, Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF) address. Additionally, Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) submissions charging information, including associated volume count, are reported with corresponding charging events to the CDF.

The Charging Characteristics play a crucial role in setting coherent chargeable event conditions, such as time and volume limits that trigger Charging Data Record (CDR) generation or information addition. These characteristics are provided by the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) to the Charging Point Control Nodes (CPCNs) as part of the subscription information. Offline charging for Control Plane (CP) data transfer in CPCN can be activated based on specific trigger conditions values per Charging Characteristics profile, including data volume limit, time duration limit, and maximum number of NIDD submissions.

For CP data transfer collection of charging information and triggers, subclause 5.2.2.1 is applicable across different network components. Specific trigger conditions for Charging Data Request are identified in respective tables for each component:
- For SCEF, additional trigger conditions are specified in Table 5.2.2.2.1.
- For IWK-SCEF, additional trigger conditions are specified in Table 5.2.2.3.1.
- For MME, additional trigger conditions are specified in Table 5.2.2.4.1.

"Describe the Enhanced Call Transfer (ECT) supplementary service as specified in 3GPP TS 22.091, including its applicability, invocation process, network options, and handling of line identities.","The Enhanced Call Transfer (ECT) supplementary service, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.091, is applicable exclusively to telephony (TS:11). The service allows a served mobile subscriber (subscriber A) who has two calls (one with subscriber B and one with subscriber C) to request the invocation of the ECT service. This can be done once a connection has been established on one of the calls, either incoming or outgoing. 

The ECT service can be invoked after the connection is established on the call between subscriber A and subscriber C. Additionally, as a network option, it can be invoked after subscriber C has been informed of the call, even if the connection has not yet been established. Upon successful invocation, the two calls (between subscriber A and subscriber B, and between subscriber A and subscriber C) are removed from subscriber A's access and transformed into a normal call between subscriber B and subscriber C. The previously held party is informed of the retrieve procedure in the normal way.

If the network option is supported, and subscriber C is being informed of the call at the time of transfer, the call remains in this state at subscriber C. When the connection is established by subscriber C, they are connected to subscriber B. Subscriber A will no longer have control over the ongoing call between B and C. The network will inform subscribers B and C of the call transfer and the state of the call to the other subscriber. If the connection is established after the transfer, subscriber B will be informed accordingly.

In cases where the network supports the option to transfer a call to subscriber C, and the connection has not yet been established, the call will be forwarded to a forwarded-to subscriber D if the Call Forwarding Busy (CFB) condition at subscriber C applies. The sending of line identities to subscriber B and forwarded-to subscriber D will correspond to the specifications for subscribers B and C, with 'subscriber C' replaced by 'the forwarded-to subscriber D'.

- Modification of an existing PDN Connection in the target UE context.
- Modification of an existing PDU Session context or SM Context for the target UE.
- Transfer of an existing PDU Session to EPS.
- Transfer of an existing PDN Connection to 5GS.

"Describe the procedures and key messages involved in establishing and maintaining a GA-CSR connection in GAN A/Gb mode, including the initiation of uplink direct transfer and CS handover.","The establishment and maintenance of a GA-CSR connection in GAN A/Gb mode involve several key procedures and messages. Initially, the GA-CSR connection is established when the mobile station (MS) requests to enter dedicated mode by sending a GA-CSR REQUEST message to the network. Upon receiving a successful response, the GA-CSR informs the upper layers that it has entered dedicated mode, allowing the transmission of messages to the network using GA-CSR UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER messages.

In the case of a network-initiated circuit-switched (CS) session, the GA-CSR connection is implicitly established when the MS responds to the GA-CSR PAGING REQUEST message with a GA-CSR PAGING RESPONSE message. Similarly, during a CS handover from GERAN or UTRAN to GAN A/Gb mode, the connection is implicitly established when the MS sends a GA-CSR HANDOVER ACCESS message to the network.

Two service access points (SAPIs) are defined for the GA-CSR connection:
- SAPI 0: Supports the transfer of signaling information, including user-user information.
- SAPI 3: Supports the transfer of user short messages.

For uplink direct transfer in the GA-CSR-DEDICATED state, the MS initiates the procedure when the upper layers request the transfer of a non-access stratum message. The MS includes the contents of the upper layer message in the IE 'L3 Message' and sets the SAPI used in the IE 'SAPI ID'.

The CS handover to GAN A/Gb mode is initiated when the source radio access technology (e.g., GERAN) orders the MS to perform the handover. This procedure is applicable in the GA-RC-REGISTERED state, provided the conditions described in the relevant annex are met. The handover order is sent via the RR HANDOVER COMMAND message. If the parameters match those of the GAN cell, the MS sends a GA-CSR HANDOVER ACCESS message to the network, including the complete RR HANDOVER COMMAND message in the Handover To GAN Command IE, and enters the GA-CSR-DEDICATED state. Depending on the channel mode indicated, the MS either starts a timer or immediately sends a GA-CSR HANDOVER COMPLETE message to the network and switches to GAN A/Gb mode.

The normal flow of paging messages involves the network sending a GA-CSR PAGING REQUEST message to the MS, which responds with a GA-CSR PAGING RESPONSE message, thereby establishing the connection.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The process of establishing a GA-CSR connection, including the initiation by the MS and the network's response.

2. **Information Flow**:
   - **Query Service API Log Request**: This request is sent from the API management function to the CAPIF core function to retrieve the service API invocation logs (Document 1).
   - **Query Service API Log Response**: The CAPIF core function processes the request and sends back the log information to the API management function (Document 2).

3. **Procedure for Auditing Service API Invocation**:

     1. Service API invocation logs must be available at the CAPIF core function.
     2. Authorization details of the API management function must be available with the CAPIF core function.
   - **Steps**:
     1. The API management function triggers the query service API log request to the CAPIF core function.
     2. The CAPIF core function accesses the necessary service API log information for auditing purposes.
     3. The CAPIF core function returns the log information to the API management function in the query service API log response (Document 3).

"Describe the error reporting mechanisms for SMS failures as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 and TS 27.005, including the specific error codes and their meanings.","The error reporting mechanisms for SMS failures are defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 and TS 27.005. In TS 23.040, the TP-Failure-Cause field is used to report the reason for failure to transfer or process a short message. This field consists of a single octet, and any reserved codes received should be treated as unspecified error causes. The TP-Failure-Cause field helps in identifying issues related to mobile terminated (MT) and mobile originated (MO) services.

In TS 27.005, the +CMS ERROR final result code indicates an error related to mobile equipment or network. When this error code is returned, none of the following commands in the same command line are executed, and neither ERROR nor OK final result codes are returned.

"Describe the functionalities and interactions of the Media Resource Broker (MRB) in In-Line mode, including the interfaces involved and the types of information it handles.","The Media Resource Broker (MRB) in In-Line mode operates between the Application Server (AS) and the Media Resource Function Controller (MRFC). In this mode, the AS sends a request to establish a dialog to the MRB using the Mr' interface or via the Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) using the ISC and Mr interfaces. The MRB then selects an appropriate Media Resource Function (MRF) resource based on the information provided in the request and forwards the request to the MRF. Subsequent messages in the same dialog between the AS and MRFC traverse the MRB, and potentially the S-CSCF if it is part of the communication path.

The interfaces involved in In-Line mode include:
- Mr interface: Used for communication between AS and MRB via S-CSCF.
- Mr' interface: Allows direct communication between MRB and MRFC without passing through S-CSCF.
- ISC interface: Used for routing requests through S-CSCF.
- Cr interface: Supports control packages directly between AS and MRFC.

The MRB handles various types of information to perform its functions, including:
- Available MRF resources and their attributes, considering planned and unplanned downtime and scheduled changes.
- Rules for fair-share allocation across applications.
- Capacity models for specific MRF resources.
- Reservations for future use of media resources, such as for conferencing or anticipated traffic spikes.

The protocol used for communication between MRB, MRFC, and S-CSCF is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229.

The process of request and assignment of MRF resources involves the MRB receiving a request from the AS, selecting suitable MRF resources, and forwarding the request to the MRF. The MRB infers that the media resource is no longer needed when it sees a session release request from either the AS or MRFC. Additionally, the MRFC can publish information to the MRB using the appropriate interfaces to facilitate resource management and allocation.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"How does the UE determine the originating party identity in the OIP service according to 3GPP specifications, and what are the relevant configurations and files involved?","The UE determines the originating party identity in the OIP service based on the presence and content of the P-Asserted-Identity and From header fields in SIP requests. According to 3GPP specifications, the UE may support the operator's originating party identity determination policy, which can be configured in the 'FromPreferred' leaf node. If the policy indicates that the From header field is not used, the UE relies on the P-Asserted-Identity header field to determine the originating user identity. If the P-Asserted-Identity header field is absent and the Privacy header field is set to 'id', the identity is considered anonymized. If the Privacy header field is set to 'none' or absent, the identity is unavailable. Conversely, if the policy indicates that the From header field is used, the UE determines the originating user identity from the From header field regardless of the presence of the P-Asserted-Identity header field.

Relevant configurations and files involved include service n°114 in the USIM Service Table and service n°17 in the ISIM Service Table. If service n°114 or service n°17 is available, the EFFromPreferred file must be present. The UE reads the EFFromPreferred file to determine if the From header field should be used for originating party identity determination. If both USIM and ISIM files are present, the ISIM file takes priority. The status byte in the EFFromPreferred file indicates whether the From header field is used or not, guiding the UE in its determination process.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of P-Asserted-Identity and From header fields in determining the originating party identity.
  - The operator's originating party identity determination policy and its configuration in the UE.
  - The significance of service n°114 and service n°17 in the USIM and ISIM Service Tables.
  - The procedure for reading the EFFromPreferred file and how the UE uses the From Preferred value.
  - The priority of ISIM over USIM when both files are present."
Describe the procedure for obtaining UE mobility analytics and the role of UDM in storing and retrieving UPF FQDN in the context of IMS PDU sessions.,"The procedure for obtaining UE mobility analytics involves several steps and interactions between different network functions (NFs) and analytics functions (AFs). 

1. **Subscription/Request Process**: 
   - The NF/AF sends an analytics subscription or request to the NWDAF1 serving the Source Area of Interest (AOI) A. This request includes the Analytics ID (UE mobility), Analytics Filter information (Source AOI A, Target AOI B), and Analytics Reporting information (target period 1). For untrusted NFs, the request is sent via a NEF, which invokes the NEF service Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe.
   - Authorization for the AF is performed in the NEF if used, and the NEF conveys the request to NWDAF1.

2. **Event Subscription/Request**:
   - Upon receiving the request, NWDAF1 may subscribe/request events from AMF/AF/OAM for UE location information. NWDAF1 identifies a candidate SUPI list of UEs currently in Source AOI A.

3. **Data Analytics Collection**:
   - For case 1, NWDAF1 sends an analytics subscribe/request to NWDAF2 serving Target AOI B to obtain UE mobility analytics for the target period 1. NWDAF2 provides the SUPI list and related mobility analytics.
   - For case 2, NWDAF1 sends similar requests to NWDAF2 for Target AOI B and NWDAF3 for Target AOI C to obtain mobility analytics for target periods 1 and 2, respectively.

4. **Final Analytics Derivation and Delivery**:
   - NWDAF1 derives the requested analytics based on the data provided by NWDAF2 and NWDAF3. For case 1, it aggregates the UE mobility analytics for UEs currently in Source AOI A and previously in Target AOI B during target period 1. For case 2, it aggregates the analytics for UEs currently in Source AOI A and previously in both Target AOI B and C during target periods 1 and 2.
   - NWDAF1 sends the derived analytics to the NF/AF, which then uses this information to derive mobility-related insights for the UEs.

In the context of IMS PDU sessions, the UDM plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving UPF Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):

1. **Storing UPF FQDN**:
   - When the UDM receives the actual UPF FQDN (or 'user-plane-locality' or 'voice-media-locality') within the Nudm_UECM_registration service operation, it stores this information as part of the SmfRegistration in the UDR.

2. **Enhancements for IMS Control Plane Nodes**:
   - IMS control plane nodes need to be enhanced to support invoking APIs provided by NRF and UDM. They use the UPF FQDN (or 'user-plane-locality' or 'voice-media-locality' or 'service area') retrieved from the UDM to map it to a locally configured optimal media plane node.

3. **Retrieving SMF Registration**:
   - When the UDM uses the Nudr_DR_Create service operation to store the SMF registration for the IMS PDU session, it includes the received UPF FQDN. When the HSS uses the Nudr_DR_Query service operation to retrieve SMF registration, the UDR responds with the SmfRegistration, including the stored UPF FQDN.

This detailed process ensures efficient handling of UE mobility analytics and proper management of UPF FQDN in IMS PDU sessions.","The answer should cover the detailed steps involved in the procedure for obtaining UE mobility analytics, including the roles of NF/AF, NEF, NWDAF1, NWDAF2, and NWDAF3. It should explain the subscription/request process, authorization, event subscription/request, data analytics collection, and final analytics derivation and delivery. Additionally, the answer should describe the role of UDM in storing UPF FQDN as part of SmfRegistration in the UDR, the enhancements needed for IMS control plane nodes, and the process for UDM to store and HSS to retrieve SMF registration for IMS PDU sessions."
"Describe the functionalities and enhancements of an MSC Server for SRVCC, and explain the terms and codecs used in GERAN A/Gb mode and Iu mode.","The functionalities and enhancements of an MSC Server for Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) include several key aspects. Firstly, the MSC Server handles the Relocation Preparation procedure requested for the voice component from the MME/SGSN, giving priority if a priority indication is received via the Sv reference point. It also behaves as an MSC Server enhanced for IMS Centralized Services (ICS) if supported and when the ICS flag received via the Sv reference point is set to true, and optionally if the MSC Server is configured to know that the VPLMN has a suitable roaming agreement with the HPLMN of the UE. Additionally, the MSC Server invokes the session transfer procedure or emergency session transfer procedure from IMS to CS, coordinating the CS Handover and session transfer procedures. In non-emergency sessions, it handles the MAP_Update_Location procedure without it being triggered from the UE, and in emergency sessions, it conditionally sends a MAP Subscriber Location Report to a GMLC to support location continuity.

In GERAN A/Gb mode, several terms and codecs are used. The AoIP-Selected codec (Target) is the codec selected by the target BSS to be used by the UE/MS after handover. The AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) is a list of codecs derived by the anchor MSC-A/3G_MSC-A based on the codecs supported by the MS and available at the anchor MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, ordered by priority. The AoIP-Available Codecs list (MAP) includes codecs available for the target AoIP interface signaled via MAP. The CSG ID list contains the CSG IDs for which the MS has a valid subscription for a specific PLMN-ID.

In Iu mode, the Iu Currently used codec is the codec used by the UE/MS before a handover or SRNS relocation, while the Iu Selected codec is the codec to be used after the handover or SRNS relocation. The Iu Supported Codecs List includes codecs supported by the MS and the core network, provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to 3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC handover/relocation, with separate lists for UTRAN Iu mode and GERAN Iu mode. The default speech codec in UTRAN Iu mode is the UMTS AMR or UMTS AMR2 codec, and in GERAN Iu mode, it is the AMR FR codec. The SRVCC MSC and vSRVCC MSC are MSC servers enhanced for SRVCC and vSRVCC, respectively. UE Specific Behaviour Information - Iu (UESBI-Iu) is information sent from the MSC to the RAN to derive specific information about the UE's capabilities.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The functionalities and enhancements of an MSC Server for SRVCC, including handling relocation preparation, session transfer procedures, coordination of CS Handover, and handling location updates.
  - Definitions and explanations of terms related to GERAN A/Gb mode and Iu mode, such as AoIP-Selected codec, AoIP-Supported Codecs List, AoIP-Available Codecs list, Iu Currently used codec, Iu Selected codec, Iu Supported Codecs List, Default speech codec, SRVCC MSC, vSRVCC MSC, and UE Specific Behaviour Information - Iu (UESBI-Iu)."
Describe the functional entities involved in the IOPS mode of operation for MC service UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.180.,"The IOPS mode of operation for MC service UE involves three main functional entities: the IOPS connectivity client, the MC service client, and the signalling user agent. 

1. **IOPS Connectivity Client**: This functional entity is responsible for enabling user registration and discovery by the IOPS MC system when operating in IOPS mode. It ensures that the user at the MC service client is registered and discovered appropriately. This entity is located within the MC service UE.

2. **MC Service Client**: This entity acts as the user agent for MC service transactions and IOPS-related application transactions. Examples of MC service clients include MCPTT (Mission Critical Push-To-Talk) and MCData clients. It supports the IOPS mode of operation by handling all necessary transactions related to the MC services.

3. **Signalling User Agent**: This functional entity supports all required transactions related to IOPS discovery at the MC service client. It includes processes such as registration, publication, subscription, and notification events, ensuring seamless communication and discovery within the IOPS MC system.

The UE 1, which is an MC service UE supporting the IOPS mode of operation, integrates these functional entities to provide comprehensive support for MC services over the IOPS MC system. It supports bearer services and applications necessary for delivering MC services, ensuring robust and efficient operation in IOPS mode.","The answer should detail the three main functional entities involved in the IOPS mode of operation for MC service UE: the IOPS connectivity client, the MC service client, and the signalling user agent. It should explain their roles and interactions, including user registration and discovery, handling MC service transactions, and supporting IOPS discovery events. Additionally, it should mention that UE 1 integrates these entities to provide comprehensive support for MC services over the IOPS MC system."
"Describe the flow control mechanisms and requirements for asynchronous services in 3GPP TS 29.007, including the roles of the L2R function, MSC/IWF, and fixed network.","In 3GPP TS 29.007, flow control mechanisms for asynchronous services are crucial for managing data transmission between the User Equipment (UE), the Mobile Switching Center/Interworking Function (MSC/IWF), and the fixed network. The Layer 2 Relay (L2R) function plays a central role in controlling and responding to flow control requests.

The L2R function is responsible for providing immediate indications of flow control to both the fixed network and the UE upon receiving flow control requests. This ensures that data transmission is regulated effectively to prevent buffer overflow and data loss. Flow control can be either in-band (X-on/X-off) or outband, with specific rules for each type. In-band flow control characters are not passed across the radio interface, while outband flow control requires V.42 functionality in the modems of the MSC/IWF and the fixed network. If V.42 functionality cannot be provided, the system falls back to non-error correction mode, and flow control initiation/removal towards the fixed network is not possible.

Flow control is initiated by the L2R function under two conditions: when the transmit buffer reaches a preset threshold (BACK PRESSURE) or when an explicit 'flow control active' indication is received. Flow control is removed upon the resolution of buffer congestion or receipt of a 'flow control inactive' indication.

The MSC/IWF buffers incoming data from the fixed network to prevent data loss if the radio path is unable to transfer data. The buffer size is determined by the implementers, and flow control towards the fixed network is initiated when the buffer is half full, as per the guidelines in subclause 9.2.4.5.1.

For ISDN interworking, flow control mechanisms vary depending on the type of bearer service. For V.110 interworking, outband flow control is managed by the 'X' bit in the V.110 frame, while for V.120 interworking, it involves the data link control sublayer functions. PIAFS interworking uses the data link control sublayer to withhold the update of the frame number.

If no flow control is provided, the involved end systems must perform in-band flow control independently, considering the buffer capacity of the MSC/IWF. In cases where buffer overflow occurs, the IWF may release the connection to prevent data loss.

Overall, the flow control mechanisms in 3GPP TS 29.007 ensure efficient data transmission and synchronization between the UE, MSC/IWF, and fixed network, with specific provisions for handling asynchronous services and ISDN interworking.","The answer must include the role of the L2R function in controlling and responding to flow control requests, the conditions under which flow control is initiated and removed, the handling of in-band and outband flow control, the requirements for V.42 functionality, the management of buffers in the MSC/IWF, and the specific rules for asynchronous services and ISDN interworking. It should also address the implications of not providing flow control and the fallback mechanisms in place."
"Describe the procedures that the participating MCData function must follow upon receiving a SIP INFO request with the Info-Package header field set to g.3gpp.mcdata-com-release package, and the subsequent responses from the controlling MCData function.","Upon receiving a SIP INFO request with the Info-Package header field set to g.3gpp.mcdata-com-release package from an MCData client within the SIP dialog of the MCData communication, the participating MCData function must follow specific procedures. Firstly, it shall generate a SIP INFO request according to the rules and procedures outlined in 3GPP TS 24.229 and IETF RFC 6086. The contents of the Info-Package header field of the incoming SIP INFO request must be copied to the Info-Package header field of the outgoing SIP INFO request. Additionally, any MIME bodies present in the incoming SIP INFO request must be copied to the outgoing SIP INFO request. The SIP INFO request should then be sent to the controlling MCData function within the SIP dialog of the MCData communication, following the guidelines of 3GPP TS 24.229.

Describe the procedure and requirements for a UE to report SCG failure information due to consistent uplink LBT failures in a shared spectrum scenario.,"In a shared spectrum scenario, the procedure and requirements for a User Equipment (UE) to report Secondary Cell Group (SCG) failure information due to consistent uplink Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) failures are as follows:

1. **Scenario Setup**: The UE must be in the RRC_CONNECTED state with E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) and operating in a shared spectrum. The primary cell (PCell) is an E-UTRA cell, and the primary secondary cell (PSCell) is an NR cell.

2. **Conditions**: The UE receives an IP packet to loopback on the SCG Data Radio Bearer (DRB) and encounters consistent uplink LBT failures. This occurs when the channel is identified as being occupied, preventing transmission.

3. **Procedure**: 
   - When the UE detects consistent uplink LBT failures, it initiates the NR SCG failure information procedure.
   - The UE reports the SCGFailureInformationNR message with the failure type set to scg-lbtFailure.

4. **Conformance Requirements**: 
   - According to TS 38.321 clause 5.21.1, the lower layer performs an LBT procedure before transmission. If the channel is occupied, an LBT failure indication is sent to the MAC entity.
   - TS 36.331 clause 5.6.13a.3 specifies that the UE shall include the failureType within the failureReportSCG-NR and set it to indicate the SCG failure.
   - TS 38.331 clause 5.3.10.3 outlines that upon consistent uplink LBT failure indication from the SCG MAC, the UE should initiate the SCG failure information procedure to report SCG radio link failure.

5. **Test Description**: 
   - Pre-test conditions include the configuration of the E-UTRA and NR cells, system information combination, and the UE being in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific test mode and loop function settings.
   - The test procedure sequence involves the UE attempting to send data, detecting consistent LBT failures, and reporting the SCG failure information.

Describe the functionalities and management policies of the ANDSF Management Object (MO) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.312.,"The ANDSF Management Object (MO) is designed to manage several key policies and information types to facilitate efficient network connectivity and traffic management for User Equipment (UE). These include the Inter-System Mobility Policy (ISMP), Inter-System Routing Policy (ISRP), Inter-APN Routing Policy (IARP), RuleSelectionInformation, WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP), and access network discovery information. Additionally, the ANDSF MO manages the HomeNetworkPreference policy, which includes the Preferred Service Provider List (PSPL) and S2a Connectivity Preference.

The ANDSF MO enables the provisioning of information from the ANDSF to the UE and vice versa. For instance, if the UE wishes to provide user location information to the ANDSF, it includes a Generic Alert message in Package 1 with specific elements set to convey the location data. Similarly, UE profile information can be transmitted using a similar method. The UE can also initiate a client-initiated session to request all available information from the ANDSF using a Generic Alert message.

ISMP prioritizes access networks when the UE cannot connect to the EPC through multiple accesses, while ISRP indicates how to distribute traffic among available accesses when the UE can connect to the EPC through multiple accesses. IARP specifies which traffic should be routed across different PDN connections and which should be offloaded to WLAN. DiscoveryInformation provides further details for the UE to access networks defined in ISMP or ISRP, and WLANSP helps the UE select and reselect WLANs. RuleSelectionInformation determines whether to prioritize ISMP, ISRP, and WLANSP provided by HPLMN or VPLMN when the UE is roaming.

The ANDSF MO also defines validity areas, the position of the UE, and the availability of access networks in terms of geographical coordinates, which are implementation-dependent (e.g., GPS receiver). The UE is not required to activate all supported radios to deduce its location for ANDSF purposes or evaluate the validity area condition of a policy or discovery information.

Access control mechanisms, such as the OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property, can be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers to modify nodes and leaf objects of the ANDSF MO. Both the UE and the ANDSF server must ignore unsupported nodes within the ANDSF MO root node. The UE must support receiving OMA DM commands with bodies encoded as XML formatted according to specified standards.

Overall, the ANDSF MO plays a crucial role in managing network policies and facilitating seamless connectivity and traffic management for UEs.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the various policies managed by the ANDSF MO (ISMP, ISRP, IARP, RuleSelectionInformation, WLANSP, HomeNetworkPreference).
  - Description of how the ANDSF MO facilitates the provisioning of information between ANDSF and UE.
  - Specifics on how UE location and profile information are encoded and transmitted.
  - Process for client-initiated sessions to request information from ANDSF.
  - Details on traffic prioritization and distribution among multiple accesses.
  - Explanation of validity areas and geographical coordinates.

"Describe the process and requirements for handling a SIP INVITE request for the non-controlling MCVideo function of an MCVideo group, including the steps for generating a SIP 200 (OK) response and composing the SDP answer.","Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request for the non-controlling MCVideo function of an MCVideo group, the process involves several steps and conditions for handling the request. If a chat group call is not ongoing, the non-controlling MCVideo function must first check if it can process the request without risking congestion or resource limitations. If unable to process, it may reject the request with a SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response, potentially including a Retry-After header field.

Next, the non-controlling MCVideo function must determine if the media parameters and MCVideo codecs offered in the SDP offer are acceptable. If not, it should reject the request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response. Additionally, the function must check for specific media feature tags in the Accept-Contact header field. If the g.3gpp.mcvideo or g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tags are missing, it should reject the request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.

If the partner MCVideo system does not have a mutual aid relationship with the primary MCVideo system identified by the P-Asserted-Identity, the request should be rejected with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response, including a warning text ","The answer must include the conditions under which the SIP INVITE request can be rejected, the steps for generating a SIP 200 (OK) response, the requirements for composing the SDP answer, and the interaction with the media plane. It should also cover the specific header fields and MIME body elements that need to be included in the SIP 200 (OK) response."
"Describe the procedures and requirements for inter-UE transfer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.337, including the roles of UEs and the SCC AS, and the use of specific SIP and PIDF elements.","The procedures and requirements for inter-UE transfer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.337 involve several key elements and roles for UEs and the SCC AS. 

Firstly, the discovery procedures for target UEs are outlined, where candidate UEs for inter-UE transfer are identified through a contact list represented in SIP using SIP contact or instance-id. The subscriptions of these candidate UEs are configured such that the private user identities associated with the UEs involved in inter-UE transfer share the same set of implicitly registered public user identities.

For UEs to support inter-UE transfer without prior session information, they must implement the 'application/pidf+xml' content type as described in RFC 3863 and the PIDF extension specified in annex C.4 of the document. UEs must subscribe to presence information state changes of other candidate UEs by generating a SUBSCRIBE request for each candidate UE, with the Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the candidate UE and a filter selecting the <IUT-solicitation> element.

UEs must publish their presence status by generating a PUBLISH request, acting as an Event Publication Agent (EPA) in accordance with RFC 3903. The presence status includes the class element set to 'IUT' according to RFC 4480. If a UE does not wish to be the target of an IUT operation, the <status> element of the PIDF XML document should contain the <basic> element set to 'open'. If the UE wants to be the target of an IUT operation, the <status> element should contain the <IUT-solicitation> element, which may include one or more <mediaType> elements and the <sessionControl> element set to 'true'.

When a UE receives a NOTIFY request indicating presence information change of another UE status to 'IUT-solicitation', it must decide whether to transfer the solicited media(s) and, if applicable, the corresponding collaborative session control. If the UE decides to transfer the media, it proceeds with the relevant IUT procedures as described in clauses 10, 11, and 12.

The SCC AS plays a crucial role by implementing presence server functionality as specified in 3GPP TS 24.141. It must accept any subscription request from a UE to the presence information status with a filter selecting the <IUT-solicitation> element of another UE that belongs to the same list of candidate UEs for inter-UE transfer. UE publications within the class 'IUT' are only notified to UEs belonging to the same list of candidate UEs for inter-UE transfer and for subscriptions containing a filter selecting the <IUT-solicitation>.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The discovery procedures for target UEs and the configuration of candidate UEs' subscriptions.
  - The requirements for UEs to support inter-UE transfer without prior session information, including the implementation of 'application/pidf+xml' content type, subscription for presence information, and publication of presence status.
  - The handling of NOTIFY requests indicating presence information changes.
  - The role of the SCC AS in implementing presence server functionality, accepting subscription requests, and notifying UEs of publications within the 'IUT' class."
"Describe the requirements and measurement methodologies for transmit modulation quality in 3GPP specifications, particularly focusing on Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), carrier leakage, and in-band emissions.","Transmit modulation quality is a critical parameter for ensuring the expected in-channel RF transmissions from the User Equipment (UE). It is defined by several specific parameters, including Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), EVM equalizer spectrum flatness, carrier leakage, and in-band emissions for non-allocated resource blocks (RBs).

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) measures the deviation of the actual transmitted signal from the ideal signal. It is specified for the allocated RBs and is derived from the equalizer coefficients generated during the EVM measurement process. EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is another parameter that assesses the consistency of the equalizer coefficients across the spectrum.

Carrier leakage refers to an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency matches the modulated waveform carrier frequency. The measurement interval for carrier leakage is one slot in the time domain. In cases of uplink sharing, the carrier leakage may exhibit a 7.5 kHz shift with the carrier frequency. The relative carrier leakage power, which is the power ratio of the additive sinusoid waveform to the modulated waveform, must not exceed the values specified in the relevant tables.

In-band emissions for non-allocated RBs are also measured to ensure that transmissions do not interfere with adjacent channels. All these parameters are defined using the measurement methodologies specified in Annex F of the relevant 3GPP documents.

There are specific conditions under which the carrier leakage measurement requirements can be waived. If the parameters 3300 or 3301 are reported from the UE via the parameter txDirectCurrentLocation in the UplinkTxDirectCurrentList Information Element (IE), as defined in TS 38.331, the carrier leakage measurement requirements in clauses 6.4.2.2 and 6.4.2.3 can be waived. Additionally, the RF correction regarding carrier leakage and IQ image can be omitted during the calculation of transmit modulation quality.

Overall, these requirements and methodologies ensure that the transmit modulation quality of the UE meets the necessary standards for effective and interference-free communication.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Definition and importance of transmit modulation quality.
  - Specific parameters used to measure transmit modulation quality: EVM, EVM equalizer spectrum flatness, carrier leakage, and in-band emissions.
  - Measurement methodologies as specified in the relevant annexes.
  - Conditions under which carrier leakage measurement requirements can be waived.
  - Detailed requirements for carrier leakage, including measurement interval, frequency shift, and power ratio limits."
"Describe the different types of cancellation procedures used by the HSS/UDM in 3GPP networks, including the specific scenarios in which each type is applied.","In 3GPP networks, the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and Unified Data Management (UDM) use various cancellation procedures to manage user equipment (UE) contexts. These procedures are defined to handle different scenarios such as subscription withdrawal, UE movement, and initial attach processes. The main types of cancellation procedures and their specific applications are as follows:

1. **MME_UPDATE_PROCEDURE (0)**: This cancellation type is used when the Cancel Location is sent to the previous Mobility Management Entity (MME) due to a received Update Location message from a new MME. It is also used when the HSS+UDM receives an Nudm_UEContextManagement service request from the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) or when the HSS receives an Nhss_UECM_SNDeregistration service operation from the UDM.

2. **SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE (1)**: This type is applied when the Cancel Location is sent to the previous Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) due to a received Update Location message from a new SGSN. Similar to the MME update procedure, it is also triggered by an Nudm_UEContextManagement service request from the AMF or an Nhss_UECM_SNDeregistration service operation from the UDM.

3. **SUBSCRIPTION_WITHDRAWAL (2)**: This cancellation type is used when the HSS sends a Cancel Location to the current MME or SGSN due to the withdrawal of the user's subscription by the HSS operator. It is also used when the Cancel VCSG Location is sent by the CSS to the current MME or SGSN due to the withdrawal of the user's VPLMN CSG subscription by the CSS operator. Additionally, it is applied if the subscriber profile no longer allows Packet-Switched (PS) services or if Core Network Restrictions prevent access to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).

4. **UPDATE_PROCEDURE_IWF (3)**: This type is used by an Interworking Function (IWF) when interworking with a pre-Release 8 HSS. It ensures compatibility and proper handling of cancellation procedures with older network elements.

5. **INITIAL_ATTACH_PROCEDURE (4)**: This cancellation type is used when the Cancel Location is sent to the MME or SGSN due to a received Update Location message during the initial attach procedure from an SGSN or MME, respectively. It ensures that the UE's context is properly managed during the initial network attachment.

Each of these cancellation types is crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date UE contexts within the network, ensuring seamless mobility and service continuity for users. For further details on the specific procedures and conditions, refer to clause 5.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.563.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of each cancellation type: MME_UPDATE_PROCEDURE, SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE, SUBSCRIPTION_WITHDRAWAL, UPDATE_PROCEDURE_IWF, and INITIAL_ATTACH_PROCEDURE. It should cover the specific scenarios in which each type is applied, such as UE movement to a new MME or SGSN area, subscription withdrawal by the operator, and initial attach procedures.

"How is the Noc level for Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 1 Requirements and Mode 1 Configuration derived, and what methodology is used to define the minimum Noc level for power class X and operating band Y?","The Noc level for Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 1 Requirements and Mode 1 Configuration needs to be adjusted and can be derived similarly to the Noc level for UE demodulation test methods. This involves using the methodology described in Clause 7.2.2, which includes specific parameters and calculations.

To define the minimum Noc level for power class X (PC_X) and operating band Y (Band_Y), the following formula is used:
Noc (PC_X, Band_Y) = REFSENSPCX, BandY - 10log10(SCSREFSENS x PRBREFSENS x 12) - SNRREFSENS + ∆thermal

Where:
- REFSENSPCX, BandY is the REFSENS value in dBm specified for Power Class X UE in band Y for a 100MHz channel bandwidth.
- SCSREFSENS is 120 kHz.
- PRBREFSENS is the number of resource blocks associated with the subcarrier spacing SCSREFSENS for a 100MHz channel bandwidth.
- 12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB.
- SNRREFSENS is -1 dB, which is the signal-to-noise ratio used for the simulation of REFSENS.
- ∆thermal is the amount of dB that the wanted noise is set above UE thermal noise, giving a rise in total noise of ∆BB. ∆thermal is 6dB, resulting in a rise in total noise of 1dB.

This methodology ensures that the Noc level is accurately defined for different power classes and operating bands, taking into account various technical parameters and their interactions.","The answer must include the derivation process for the Noc level for Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 1 Requirements and Mode 1 Configuration, referencing the adjustment and similarity to UE demodulation test methods.

What are the specifications for Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculations in different types of frames?,"The specifications for Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculations in different types of frames are as follows:

1. **Header of Data Frames**:
   - **Polynomial**: For the 7-bit header CRC, the polynomial used is X^7+X^6+X^2+1. For the 11-bit header CRC, the polynomial used is X^11+X^9+X^8+X^2+X+1.
   - **Value Range**: {0..127} for FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD, and {0..2047} for E-DCH DATA FRAME.
   - **Field Length**: 7 bits for FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD, and 11 bits for E-DCH DATA FRAME.

2. **Payload of Data Frames**:
   - **Polynomial**: The polynomial used for the payload CRC is X^16+X^15+X^2+1.
   - **Field Length**: 16 bits.
   - **Special Conditions**: In HS-DSCH DATA FRAME TYPE3, if MUI is set, the CRC calculation covers all bits in the data frame payload and all bits in the Extended for UEn in HS-DSCH DATA FRAME TYPE 3 structure.

3. **Control Frames**:
   - **Polynomial**: The polynomial used for the control frame CRC is X^7+X^6+X^2+1.

   - **Field Length**: 7 bits.

Error detection is provided on frames through CRC, with the payload CRC being 16 bits, the data frame header CRC being 7 or 11 bits, and the control frame CRC being 7 bits.","The answer should include the CRC specifications for the header of data frames, payload of data frames, and control frames. It should detail the polynomial used for each type of CRC calculation, the value range, and the field length. Additionally, it should mention any special conditions, such as those for HS-DSCH DATA FRAME TYPE3."
"Explain the use of DTX in TCH channels as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008, including the mandatory subsets of TDMA frames that must be transmitted, the handling of silent periods, and the range measurement requirements for CTS-FP.","Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) is a technique used in TCH channels to reduce power consumption and interference by only transmitting necessary frames. According to 3GPP TS 45.008, when DTX is employed on a TCH, not all TDMA frames may be transmitted. However, a specific subset of TDMA frames must always be transmitted to assess quality and signal level during DTX. For speech TCH, when no signaling or speech is to be transmitted, these TDMA frames are occupied by the SID (Silence Descriptor) frame. For data TCH, when no information is required to be transmitted, the L2 fill frame is transmitted as a FACCH in the TDMA frame subset. For PDTCH on DBPSCH in Iu mode, a dummy block is sent as a PACCH in the TDMA frame subset.

In Iu mode, during silent periods when only SACCH blocks are transmitted, L2 dummy blocks must be sent according to the interleaving configuration of the DBPSCH. For example, with 4 bursts rectangular interleaving on DBPSCH/F, a L2 dummy block is sent after every silent period of 44 TDMA frames. With 8 bursts diagonal interleaving on DBPSCH/F, it is sent after every silent period of 40 TDMA frames. For DBPSCH/H, a L2 dummy block is sent after every silent period of 20 TDMA frames.

The use of DTX is mandatory for CTS-MS and CTS-FP on a TCH, and the subset of TDMA frames specified in subclause 8.3 must always be transmitted. Additionally, the CTS-FP must monitor the delay of the signal sent by the CTS-MS to restrict the service range. The CTS-FP computes a range measurement every five reporting periods by averaging the assessed delay for each received TCH burst of the subset always to be transmitted and each received SACCH burst. If two consecutive range measurements exceed 1 bit period, the TCH is released by the CTS-FP.","The answer should cover the mandatory subsets of TDMA frames that must be transmitted during DTX for different types of TCH channels, including the handling of SID frames, L2 fill frames, and dummy blocks. It should explain the rules for silent periods and interleaving configurations in Iu mode. Additionally, it should detail the mandatory use of DTX for CTS-MS and CTS-FP, and the range measurement requirements for CTS-FP, including the conditions for releasing the TCH."
"Explain the process of Transcoder Free Operation (TFO) negotiation and optimization as described in 3GPP TS 28.062, including the steps involved in initiating TFO, handling codec mismatches, and optimizing codec configurations.","The process of Transcoder Free Operation (TFO) negotiation and optimization as described in 3GPP TS 28.062 involves several key steps:

1. **Initiation of TFO Negotiation**:
   - The local transcoder initiates TFO negotiation by sending TFO_FILL messages as soon as it receives and sends speech samples and TFO is enabled. This helps pre-synchronize potential In-Path Equipment (IPEs) quickly. If the IPE does not support TFO, it is perceived by the local transcoder as if the distant transcoder does not answer.
   - The distant transcoder may initiate the same procedure simultaneously.

2. **Sending TFO_REQ Messages**:
   - The transcoder sends TFO_REQ messages, indicating its system identification (e.g., 3G, GSM) and the speech codec type used with its main characteristics. If the distant transcoder supports TFO, it responds with a TFO_ACK message.
   - If the local and distant transcoders use compatible speech codec types or configurations, they will go into TFO. Otherwise, a codec mismatch resolution may be initiated if supported by the transcoder.
   - In some cases, transcoders might go into TFO even if both ends use different speech codec types, provided there is a substantial subset of identical codec modes.

3. **Handling Codec Mismatches**:
   - If the optional codec mismatch resolution is supported, transcoders exchange their full codec capabilities by sending TFO_REQ_L messages or Con_Req frames, which are acknowledged by TFO_ACK_L messages or Con_Ack frames.
   - Both transcoders run an algorithm to determine a common speech codec type and its configuration for TFO. If no common speech codec type exists, TFO is abandoned.
   - Once a common speech codec type/configuration is defined, each side modifies its local used speech codec type/configuration to the common speech codec type, if necessary. This may involve other network elements and requires re-initializing TFO negotiation.

4. **Optimizing Codec Configurations**:
   - Once TFO is established, transcoders exchange their capabilities available for optimization by sending TFO_REQ_L messages or configuration frames. This may trigger a codec optimization.
   - The TFO decision algorithm determines if another common speech codec type/configuration exists that could provide better speech quality while operating in TFO.
   - If optimization leads to a new common speech codec type/configuration, both ends switch to the new optimized codec following the same procedure as in codec mismatch resolution. This may temporarily break TFO while the speech codec is switched.

These steps ensure that TFO negotiation and optimization are effectively managed to maintain high-quality speech transmission without the need for transcoding.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The initial steps of TFO negotiation, including the role of TFO_FILL messages and handling non-transparent IPEs.
  - The process of sending TFO_REQ messages, system identification, and codec type exchange, along with the conditions for successful TFO establishment.
  - The procedure for handling codec mismatches, including the exchange of full codec capabilities and determining a common speech codec type.

4. **Initial Conditions**: The test shall be conducted using any of the test configurations listed in Table 6.3.2.1.3.4.1-1. The general test parameter settings are defined in Table 6.3.2.1.3.4.1-3, and message contents are specified in clause 6.3.2.1.3.4.3. The test involves one NR carrier and two cells, with Cell 1 used for connection setup.

5. **Test Procedure**: The test consists of three successive time periods (T1, T2, and T3). The steps are as follows:
   - Ensure the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific parameters set according to TS 38.508-1 clause 4.5.
   - Establish SRB2 and DRB in the RRC Reconfiguration message.

   - Transmit and receive RRCReconfiguration and RRCReconfigurationComplete messages.
   - Switch power settings from T1 to T2 and start T2.
   - Switch power settings from T2 to T3 and start T3.
   - If the UE sends PRACH preambles to Cell 2 within 2.2 seconds from the start of T3, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it is a failure.
   - After T3 expires, switch off the UE and repeat the procedure until the confidence level is achieved.

6. **Message Contents**: The message contents are defined according to TS 38.508-1 clause 7.3, with specific exceptions listed in Tables 6.3.2.1.3.4.3-1, 6.3.2.1.3.4.3-2, and 6.3.2.1.3.4.3-3.

7. **Test Requirement**: The primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Table 6.3.2.1.3.5-1. The RRC re-establishment delay is the time from the start of T3 to when the UE starts sending PRACH preambles to Cell 2. This delay should be less than 2.2 seconds, and the rate of correct RRC re-establishments should be at least 90%.

The RRC re-establishment delay is calculated using the expression:
Tre-establish_delay = TUL_grant + TUE_re-establish_delay,
where TUL_grant is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from the target cell, and TUE_re-establish_delay includes the time for identifying the intra-frequency NR cell, receiving system information, and the random access procedure, totaling 2145 ms, allowing 2.2 seconds in the test case.","The answer must include the purpose of the test, the types of NR UE it applies to, the minimum conformance requirements, the initial conditions for the test, the detailed step-by-step test procedure, the specific message contents and exceptions, and the definition and calculation of RRC re-establishment delay.

"Describe the components and management interfaces of a Virtual Network Function (VNF) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.500, and provide examples of Network Element (NE) instances.","A Network Function (NF) is a processing function in a network with defined functional behavior and interfaces. A Virtual Network Function (VNF) is an NF that runs on Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI). The VNF consists of three main components: a) the functionality of the NF(s), b) elements supporting the NF functionalities (collectively referred to as the application part of the VNF), and c) elements enabling the VNF to run on NFVI (referred to as the virtualization-specific part of the VNF). Examples of elements supporting NF functionalities include libraries, databases, and protocol stacks.

The management interfaces for a VNF include the Type 1 interface, used by the Element Manager (EM) to manage the application part of the VNF when the EM is not realized by the VNF itself. If the EM and NF are realized within one VNF, the managing interface between EM and NF is not defined. The virtualization-specific part of the VNF is managed by the Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM) using the ETSI NFV-defined Ve-Vnfm-vnf Reference Point.

"Describe the procedure for NWDAF-assisted session inactivity timer optimization, including the role of SMF and UPF in data collection and analytics processing.","The procedure for NWDAF-assisted session inactivity timer optimization involves several steps and the collaboration of different network functions, primarily SMF (Session Management Function) and UPF (User Plane Function). 

1. **Establishment of PDU Sessions**: Initially, a PDU Session is established, which requires the activation of a user plane connection for data transmission. This connection may be deactivated if the inactivity timer expires and reactivated when new data traffic is available.

2. **SMF Subscription to UE Communication Analytics**: SMF subscribes to UE communication analytics from NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function). This subscription allows SMF to receive relevant analytics data that can be used to optimize session inactivity timers.

3. **Data Collection Alternatives**: There are two alternatives for collecting N4 session data:
   - **Alternative 1 (SMF-based)**: SMF uses its service exposure framework to retrieve the required input data. NWDAF requests N4 Session related input data from SMF, which in turn requests a N4 Session Level report from UPF independently of the NWDAF request. UPF provides the requested report to SMF, which then forwards the data to NWDAF.
   - **Alternative 2 (UPF-based)**: NWDAF collects N4 Session related input data directly from UPF using implementation-specific mechanisms.

4. **NWDAF Data Collection and Analytics**: NWDAF collects the remaining input data required to produce the requested analytics. It may provide UE Communication analytics to SMF, which includes data specified in relevant tables and documents.

5. **SMF Processing of Analytics**: SMF processes the received analytics from NWDAF. Based on this analysis, SMF may decide to update the user plane inactivity timer for certain PDU Sessions associated with corresponding N4 Sessions.

6. **Updating Inactivity Timer**: SMF triggers a N4 Session modification procedure to inform UPF of the updated inactivity timer. This ensures that the user plane connection is optimized based on the latest analytics.

Throughout this procedure, SMF plays a crucial role in managing the session data and making decisions based on the analytics provided by NWDAF, while UPF is responsible for providing session level reports and implementing the inactivity timer updates as instructed by SMF.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"What are the key performance requirements and measurement techniques for GSM systems as specified in the 3GPP TS 45.005 document, including reference sensitivity levels, performance for various modulation schemes, and calculation of equivalent combined power?","The 3GPP TS 45.005 document outlines several key performance requirements and measurement techniques for GSM systems. 

Firstly, the coherency requirement for blind physical layer transmissions specifies that the transmit signal should be demodulated to a complex-valued baseband signal with a measurement bandwidth of at least 300 kHz. The equivalent combined power is calculated by summing the samples of the useful parts of four bursts within a TDMA frame without any compensation. The power of the combined signal is then averaged over the number of TDMA frames measured and converted to the dBm scale.

Secondly, the reference sensitivity performance for GSM systems, including GSM 400, GSM 700, and GSM 900, is detailed. The actual sensitivity level is defined as the input level at which the specified performance is met, and it must be less than the reference sensitivity level. For GMSK modulated signals, the reference sensitivity levels are provided in tables for both mobile stations (MS) and base transceiver stations (BTS). Additionally, for DCS 1800 class 1 and class 2 MS, specific sensitivity levels are defined for normal conditions and other performance determinations.

For various modulation schemes, such as GMSK, 8-PSK, Wideband-AMR, and Enhanced circuit-switched channels (ECSD), the minimum input signal levels required to meet reference performance are specified. These levels vary according to the type of channel and propagation conditions, with adjustments for different equipment types and modulation schemes.

Lastly, the document specifies the minimum input signal levels and reference performance for Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated SACCH channels. The performance requirements for GSM 400 and GSM 700 systems are similar to those for GSM 900, with adjustments for increased MS speeds. The reference performance for these channels is defined as a frame erasure rate (FER) of less than or equal to 5%, with specific calculation methods for FER based on the successful decoding of repeated frames.

Overall, the 3GPP TS 45.005 document provides comprehensive guidelines for ensuring the performance and measurement accuracy of GSM systems across various modulation schemes and equipment types.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The coherency requirement and measurement bandwidth for blind physical layer transmissions.

Describe the process and key elements involved in the collection and processing of UE data for analytics by NWDAF as per 3GPP specifications.,"The collection and processing of UE data for analytics by NWDAF involves several key elements and steps as per 3GPP specifications. 

Firstly, the MNO AF for UE data collection plays a crucial role. It receives subscriptions for data from NWDAF and communicates with ASP Application Clients over a user plane connection to instruct them to deliver data. The MNO AF processes the data (e.g., enriches, aggregates, or normalizes) from the ASP's UE Application Clients and supplies the result to NWDAF using Naf_EventExposure_Notify.

The process begins with an NF subscribing to analytics from NWDAF, where each Analytics Id defines its input data, including Analytics Filter information such as AoI and Application ID(s). NWDAF may initiate data collection prior to this subscription. NWDAF then determines which AF for UE data collection provided by the MNO to use, based on the Application ID(s) provided. NWDAF subscribes to the AF for UE data collection input data for analytics, using Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe, including the Target for Event Reporting, Event ID(s), Event Filters, and Application ID(s).

The AF for UE data collection determines which ASP Application Clients are in scope for data collection. It requests the ASP's UE Application Client to start reporting input data as requested in the SLA. The AF for UE data collection communicates with the ASP Application Client(s) in scope over the established connection and requests and receives data from them. This procedure can be used to collect data for both 3GPP defined services and non-3GPP defined services. The AF for UE data collection processes the input data, enforces the Event ID(s) and Event Filter(s), and notifies NWDAF on the data collected according to NWDAF subscription. NWDAF then produces analytics and provides them to the consumer NF.

The establishment of a user plane connection between the ASP's UE Application Client and the MNO AF involves several steps. The user starts or interacts with the Application Client in the UE, which may contact the Application Server and receive data needed for the user plane connection to the MNO AF. The Application Client initializes the setup of a user plane connection over the existing PDU session to the MNO AF for data collection. Once the connection is ready for use, the Application Client provides the Application Id and the UE IP address that will be stored in the MNO AF to request input data from the UE Application Client.

The service operations defined for Naf_EventExposure include Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe, Naf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe, and Naf_EventExposure_Notify. The types of events that can be subscribed to by a NF consumer include Service Experience information, Performance Data information, Collective Behaviour information, UE Mobility information, UE Communication information, Exceptions information, User Data Congestion information, UE Data volume Dispersion information, and DN Performance information. Event Filters are used to specify the conditions to match for notifying the event.

In summary, the process involves the MNO AF for UE data collection, the establishment of a user plane connection, subscribing to analytics, determining the scope of data collection, communication with ASP Application Clients, processing and delivering data to NWDAF, and the production of analytics.","The answer must include the following details:

The messages on the Re interface include relevant AVPs from the Diameter base protocol and additional AVPs required for the functionality of the Re interface. These AVPs are detailed in clause 7.1.4.2.

The structure of individual messages on the Re interface is described in clause 7.1.4.1, based on the format of the Accounting-Request and Accounting-Answer messages from the Diameter base protocol. The messages use symbols to indicate mandatory and optional AVPs, as well as those that can occur multiple times.

OCS CDRs are created in the Charging Data Function (CDF), integrated within the Online Charging Function (OCF). The generation of an OCS CDR is triggered by the first incoming online charging request and remains open during the entire online charging session, closing after the final online charging response. Partial records may be supported for certain scenarios, such as Packet Switched bearer charging.

Describe the requirements and procedures for handling AOC information in SIP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 24.647.,"The handling of Advice of Charge (AOC) information in SIP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 24.647 involves several key requirements and procedures:

1. **INFO Method and AOC XML Schema**: The INFO method according to IETF RFC 6086 with legacy INFO usage is required to support AOC-D. The AOC XML schema is defined in annex D and must be transported as a SIP MIME body with the MIME type 'application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml'. Any SIP message carrying AOC information must identify the payload with this MIME type and specify the versions of the AOC XML Schema that can validate the AOC information XML body using the 'sv' or 'schemaversion' parameter. If both parameters are present, the P-CSCF will ignore the 'schemaversion' parameter.

2. **User Equipment (UE) Responsibilities**: The served UE must support the INFO method according to IETF RFC 6086 with legacy INFO usage and the AOC XML schema defined in annex D. When receiving methods or responses containing AOC information, the UE may render this information to the user either as received or recalculated. The UE must include the Accept header field with the MIME type 'application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml' and indicate the supported versions of the AOC XML Schema. Additionally, the UE should list any other MIME types it can accept.

3. **Application Server (AS) Responsibilities**: If the Accept header does not indicate support for the MIME type associated with AOC information, the AS will assume the UE supports version 1.0. When sending AOC information, the AS must encode it according to the XML schema in annex D and set the Content-Type header to 'application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml', including the appropriate schema version in the 'sv' or 'schemaversion' parameter. The Content-Disposition header should be set to 'render' with the 'handling' parameter set to 'optional'. If the AOC information is part of a message with an existing content body, the AS must create a multipart/mixed MIME body with separate sub-parts for the AOC information and the original content. If the UE does not support multipart content, the AS should forward the message unchanged.

These procedures ensure that AOC information is correctly handled and rendered, maintaining compatibility and functionality across different network elements and user equipment.","The answer must include the following key details:
  - The use of the INFO method according to IETF RFC 6086 with legacy INFO usage.

Describe the cell selection process for a UE in both idle and connected modes according to 3GPP TS 25.304.,"The cell selection process for a User Equipment (UE) in both idle and connected modes is outlined in 3GPP TS 25.304. 

In idle mode, the process begins when a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is selected by the Non-Access Stratum (NAS). The NAS controls the cell selection by providing information on Radio Access Technologies (RATs) associated with the selected PLMN, maintaining lists of forbidden registration areas, and providing a list of equivalent PLMNs. The Access Stratum (AS) then attempts to find a suitable cell to camp on. If a suitable cell is found, the UE camps on this cell and reports the event to NAS for necessary registration procedures. Upon successful registration, the UE enters the 'Camped normally' state to obtain normal service. If no suitable cell is found, the UE enters the 'Any cell selection state'.

The detailed procedures for cell selection in idle mode involve specific steps for selecting a suitable UTRA cell. The UE follows the guidelines specified in subclause 5.2.3.1 to search for a suitable cell of the selected PLMN.

In connected mode, the cell selection process is similar to that in idle mode, particularly for 'out of service' conditions. The UE uses the same procedures described in subclause 5.2.3 for idle mode. During state transitions or frequency changes in connected mode, the UE attempts to select a suitable UTRA cell on the given frequency before considering cells on other frequencies. This frequency-specific cell selection ensures that the UE maintains optimal connectivity and service continuity.

Overall, the cell selection process in both idle and connected modes involves careful consideration of RAT information, forbidden areas, equivalent PLMNs, and frequency-specific criteria to ensure the UE finds and camps on the most suitable cell.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The role of NAS in controlling cell selection, including RAT information, forbidden registration areas, and equivalent PLMNs.

2. **Emission Masks**: The emission mask requirements for repeaters are detailed in section 9.1.2.2. These requirements are based on the repeater's RF-signal output at maximum gain with WCDMA signals in the pass band. Emissions must not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 9.1 to 9.4, depending on the repeater's maximum output power. Additional requirements apply for certain bands, as outlined in Tables 9.4A, 9.4B, and 9.4C. For specific regions, additional emission requirements may apply to protect services such as DTT and adjacent spectrum services, as detailed in Tables 9.4D, 9.4E, and 9.4F.

3. **Protection Requirements**: Section 9.1.4 specifies protection requirements for bands adjacent to bands I or VII. These requirements apply only to the down-link direction of the repeater and are relevant in geographic areas where both an adjacent band service and UTRA are deployed.

4. **Intermodulation Levels**: The output intermodulation level requirements are described in section 12.1. These requirements involve measuring the power of intermodulation products when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the output port at a level 30 dB lower than the wanted signal. The interference signal frequencies should be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz, and ±15 MHz offset from the wanted signal, within the frequency band allocated for UTRA FDD downlink. The normative reference for this requirement is found in TS 25.106 section 12.

These specifications ensure that UTRA/FDD Repeaters operate effectively within their designated frequency bands, maintain appropriate emission levels, protect adjacent band services, and manage intermodulation products.","The answer should include the following key details:
- The designated frequency bands for UTRA/FDD Repeaters and the flexibility for deployment in other bands.
- The emission mask requirements, including the specific tables for different output power levels and additional requirements for certain bands.
- The protection requirements for adjacent bands, specifically for the down-link direction.
- The output intermodulation level requirements, including the frequency offsets for interference signals and the normative reference."
Describe the handling of Abstract Syntax Errors in HNBAP messages according to 3GPP TS 25.469.,"Abstract Syntax Errors in HNBAP messages are handled according to specific rules and procedures outlined in 3GPP TS 25.469. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of HNBAP messages, including the order and occurrence of Information Elements (IEs). IEs must be ordered as they appear in object set definitions, and their presence is determined by fields such as 'mandatory', 'optional', or 'conditional'. If a message is not constructed according to these rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error.

When a receiving node encounters a message with IEs or IE groups in the wrong order, with too many occurrences, or erroneously present, it follows specific behaviors. If the message initiates a procedure, the node rejects the procedure and reports the cause value 'Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)'. If the message does not have a procedure to report unsuccessful outcomes, the node terminates the procedure and initiates the Error Indication procedure. For response messages, the node considers the procedure unsuccessfully terminated and initiates local error handling.

Abstract Syntax Errors are defined as cases where the receiving entity cannot understand IEs (unknown IE id), receives IEs with violated logical ranges, does not receive mandatory IEs, receives IEs in the wrong order or with too many occurrences, or receives conditional IEs when the condition is not met. Handling of these errors depends on Criticality and Presence information, with cases involving wrong order or too many occurrences resulting in procedure rejection. The receiver reads the remaining message and acts according to the Criticality and Presence information for each detected error.","The answer should include the following key points:
  - Explanation of the ASN.1 definition and rules for constructing HNBAP messages as per Document 1.
  - Description of the behavior of the receiving node when encountering Abstract Syntax Errors, including the rejection of procedures and initiation of the Error Indication procedure as per Document 2.
  - Detailed definition of Abstract Syntax Errors, including specific cases and handling based on Criticality and Presence information as per Document 3."
Describe the procedures for establishing and managing MSRP connections for sending and receiving SDS messages in MCData functions as specified in TS 24.582.,"The procedures for establishing and managing MSRP connections for sending and receiving SDS messages in MCData functions are detailed in TS 24.582. These procedures involve different roles and steps for originating, controlling, and terminating MCData functions.

1. **Receiving SDS Messages**:
   - The participating MCData function must act according to IETF RFC 6135. If the 'a=setup' attribute in the sent SDP answer is set to 'passive', the function acts as a 'passive' endpoint. If the attribute is set to 'active', it acts as an 'active' endpoint.
   - The function must establish an MSRP connection based on the parameters in the sent SDP answer response, as described in IETF RFC 4976.

2. **Sending SDS Messages**:
   - The participating MCData function must act according to IETF RFC 6135. If the 'a=setup' attribute in the received SDP answer is set to 'passive', the function acts as an 'active' endpoint. If the attribute is set to 'active', it acts as a 'passive' endpoint.
   - The function must establish the MSRP connection based on the parameters in the received SDP answer response, as described in IETF RFC 4976.

3. **Originating MCData Function**:
   - The originating participating MCData function should establish the MSRP session with the originating MCData client as specified in clause 6.2.2.2.
   - It should also establish the MSRP session with the controlling MCData function as specified in clause 6.2.2.3.
   - Upon receiving an MSRP SEND request from the originating MCData client, if an MSRP connection is not established with the controlling MCData function, it must establish the connection as specified in clause 6.2.2.4.2. Otherwise, it uses the existing connection.
   - The function must forward the received MSRP SEND request to the controlling MCData function according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975. It must also forward the MSRP 200 (OK) response or error response from the controlling MCData function to the originating MCData client according to the same rules.

"Describe the process and requirements for an Application Server (AS) to obtain data collection and reporting configuration from a Data Collection AF instance, including the necessary service operations and parameters involved.","An Application Server (AS) instance, acting as a data collection client, acquires its domain-specific data collection and reporting configuration from a Data Collection AF instance through the Ndcaf_DataReporting service. This can be done either directly across reference point R4 or via an equivalent service exposed by the Network Exposure Function (NEF), depending on whether the AS and the Data Collection AF reside in the same or separate trust domains. The AS must invoke the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation to obtain its configuration, as described in clause 7.2.2.3.1.

The Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation supports specific URL query parameters, request and response data structures, and headers. These are detailed in tables 7.2.2.3.1-1 to 7.2.2.3.1-5. The URL query parameters are specified in table 7.2.2.3.1-1, while the request data structures are outlined in table 7.2.2.3.1-2.

Additionally, it should mention the baseline configuration parameters required for each Event ID as defined in TS 26.531 clause 4.6.3."
"Compare and contrast the cell identification methods and parameters used in GSM, UMTS, E-UTRAN, and NG-RAN as described in 3GPP TS 23.041.","The cell identification methods and parameters used in GSM, UMTS, E-UTRAN, and NG-RAN vary significantly, reflecting the different architectures and requirements of each technology.

For GSM, cell identification is managed using a Cell-List parameter, which identifies a sequence of one or more cells. These cells can be described in LAC and CI format or CI format only, as detailed in 3GPP TS 48.008. The CBC can refer to all cells in a LAC or a complete BSC, but the Cell-List must include at least one cell.

In UMTS, cell identification is handled through Service Areas, which are uniquely identified by a Service Area Identifier (SAI). The SAI is composed of the PLMN-Id, LAC, and SAC, where the SAC is defined by the operator and set in the RNC via O&M. For CBS, a Service Area consists of only one cell, and the mapping of SAI onto the cell is controlled by the RNC and managed by an O&M function.

E-UTRAN uses several parameters for cell identification:
- The Tracking Area ID List IE uniquely identifies a Tracking Area.
- The Warning Area List IE indicates areas where warning messages need to be broadcast, consisting of a Cell ID list, TAI list, or Emergency Area ID list.
- The Emergency Area ID List IE indicates areas impacted by emergencies.
- The Unknown Tracking Area List IE identifies Tracking Areas unknown to the MME/AMF, where requests cannot be delivered.

NG-RAN also employs specific parameters for cell identification:
- The List of NG-RAN TAIs IE uniquely identifies NG-RAN Tracking Areas.
- The Warning Area List NG-RAN IE indicates areas for broadcasting warning messages, consisting of a Cell ID list, NG-RAN TAI list, or Emergency Area ID list.
- The Emergency Area ID List IE indicates areas impacted by emergencies.
- The Unknown NG-RAN Tracking Area List IE identifies Tracking Areas unknown to the AMF, where requests cannot be delivered.

Each technology has distinct methods and parameters for cell identification, reflecting their unique network structures and operational requirements. GSM uses a straightforward Cell-List, UMTS employs Service Areas with SAIs, E-UTRAN utilizes various lists for tracking and warning areas, and NG-RAN has similar lists tailored to its advanced architecture.","The answer should cover the different methods of cell identification for GSM, UMTS, E-UTRAN, and NG-RAN, including the specific parameters and identifiers used (Cell-List, SAI, SAC, TAI, Emergency Area ID).

- Initial Conditions: The Mobile Equipment (ME) is connected to the USIM Simulator and the UMTS System Simulator (USS). The 'data download via SMS-PP' service is available in the USIM Service Table.
- Procedure: The procedure involves several expected sequences, most of which are void. The key sequence is Expected Sequence 1.9, which involves SMS-PP Data Download over Circuit Switched (CS) or Packet Switched (PS) domains in UTRAN or GERAN networks. If the ME supports A.1/156, the CS related procedure is performed, followed by the Generic Test Procedure 1 with specific parameters such as using the USS as the network simulator, and the CS domain for sending and receiving short messages. If A.1/156 is not supported but A.1/158 is, the PS related procedure is performed with similar parameters but using the PS domain.

For the scenario described in Document 2:
- Initial Conditions: The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the Evolved UMTS System Simulator (E-USS) or Narrowband System Simulator (NB-SS). The 'data download via SMS-PP' service is available in the USIM Service Table.

Explain the handling of criticality information in HNBAP messages as defined in 3GPP TS 25.469.,"In HNBAP messages, criticality information is set for individual Information Elements (IEs) and IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver on how to act when receiving an IE or IE group that is not comprehended. The three possible values of criticality information for an IE or IE group are: Reject IE, Ignore IE and Notify Sender, and Ignore IE.

When an IE or IE group is not comprehended, the receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the criticality information. If the criticality is 'Reject IE', the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the criticality is 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure, while notifying the sender about the missing elements. If the criticality is 'Ignore IE', the receiving node shall simply ignore the missing IEs and proceed with the procedure.

Additionally, the criticality information is used in case of missing IE/IE group abstract syntax errors. The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the criticality information specified in the received message. Detailed handling procedures for these scenarios are outlined in subclauses 10.3.2, 10.3.4, and 10.3.5 of the 3GPP TS 25.469 document.","The answer should include the following key points:

What are the OTA sensitivity and out-of-band blocking requirements for FR2 and IAB receivers as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.174 and TS 38.176 documents?,"According to the 3GPP TS 38.174 and TS 38.176 documents, there are specific requirements for OTA sensitivity and out-of-band blocking for FR2 and IAB receivers. 

For FR2, there is no specific OTA sensitivity requirement. The OTA sensitivity is the same as the OTA reference sensitivity, which is detailed in clause 10.3 of TS 38.174. This means that the sensitivity measurements for FR2 should follow the reference sensitivity parameters outlined in that clause.

Regarding the out-of-band blocking requirements for IAB receivers, both TS 38.174 and TS 38.176 specify additional conditions when NR, E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS, GSM/EDGE BS, or IAB-DU and/or IAB-MT are co-located with an IAB-Node operating in a different frequency band. These requirements include:
- The interferer power levels are specified at the co-location reference antenna conducted input.
- The interfering signal power is specified per supported polarization.
- The requirement is valid over the minSENS RoAoA.
- For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the parameters in the respective tables (Table 10.6.4-1 in TS 38.174 and Table 7.6.5.1.2-1 in TS 38.176), the throughput must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3 of TS 38.174 for each IAB channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal are further specified in annex F of TS 38.174 and annex H of TS 38.176.

Describe the key transmission schemes and performance targets for LTE as defined in the 3GPP TS 25.912 document.,"The 3GPP TS 25.912 document outlines several key transmission schemes and performance targets for LTE. 

For the downlink transmission scheme, LTE uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). Each 10 ms radio frame is divided into 10 equally sized sub-frames. This structure supports coexistence with LCR-TDD, as specified in clause 6.2.1.1.1, when operating E-UTRA in TDD mode. Channel-dependent scheduling and link adaptation can operate on a sub-frame level, allowing for efficient resource allocation and adaptation to varying channel conditions.

For the uplink transmission scheme, LTE employs low-PAPR Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) with a cyclic prefix. This approach ensures uplink inter-user orthogonality and enables efficient frequency-domain equalization at the receiver side. Each 10 ms radio frame is divided into 20 equally sized sub-frames, and scheduling can operate on a sub-frame level. Similar to the downlink, the uplink frame structure supports coexistence with LCR-TDD. Additionally, the baseline uplink transmission scheme includes the transmission of orthogonal pilot patterns from single Tx-antenna UEs to facilitate multi-user MIMO reception at the Node B.

In terms of performance targets, the agreed goal for LTE uplink spectrum efficiency is a 2-3 times gain compared to the baseline configuration. Multiple evaluations have been conducted by various sources and for different scenarios, showing gains ranging from around 2 times to above 3 times. The system performance for VoIP traffic has also been evaluated, demonstrating a VoIP capacity of more than 3 times versus the baseline configuration. It is noted that some proposed LTE features, such as variable TTI for overhead/delay optimization and different interference mitigation schemes, were not included in all evaluations, indicating potential for further enhancements in LTE uplink performance.

Overall, the LTE SC-FDMA-based uplink as defined in clause 7.2 of the TS 25.912 document includes the necessary features to meet the agreed targets for uplink spectrum efficiency.","The answer should cover the downlink transmission scheme using OFDMA, the uplink transmission scheme using SC-FDMA with cyclic prefix, the frame structure for both FDD and TDD modes, the coexistence with LCR-TDD, the scheduling and link adaptation capabilities, the multi-user MIMO reception, and the performance targets for uplink spectrum efficiency including the observed gains and potential for further enhancements."

"Describe the call flow for IMS origination via CS access for non ICS UE and ICS UE, including the roles of MSC Server and SCC AS.","The call flow for IMS origination via CS access for non ICS UE and ICS UE involves several steps and key components such as the MSC Server and SCC AS.

For non ICS UE:
1. The UE A sends a CS call setup message containing the B-party number to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS according to standard CS originating procedures.
2. The MSC Server sends an INVITE to the S-CSCF with the Request-URI set to the B-party number. If a GRUU is to be included, it includes a temporary-GRUU as the contact address if privacy has been requested or a public-GRUU if privacy has not been requested. The INVITE also contains SDP received from the CS-MGW. The MSC Server adds the User Location Information (e.g., CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the INVITE. For a roaming user, when the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout is supported, the MSC Server may add a reference to the preferred Transit and Roaming Function based on operator policy.
3. The S-CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter criteria direct the S-CSCF to send the INVITE to the SCC AS.
4. The SCC AS invokes a B2BUA, terminating the UE A Leg and originating the Remote Leg for presentation of an IMS session towards the B-party on behalf of UE A. The SCC AS creates an INVITE containing the SDP received in the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path, indicating CS voice or voice and video media. The INVITE request is routed from the SCC AS to the S-CSCF.
5. The S-CSCF continues with standard IMS originated session processing and routes the request onwards to the B-party.
6. Completion of the session and bearer control setup procedures. For video calls, specific handling as described in the relevant clause applies.

For ICS UE:
1. The ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating session using the B-party's E.164 number or a number derived from the Tel-URI. The call is routed to IMS via an MSC Server enhanced to support ICS or a standard MSC Server using IN (e.g., CAMEL) based re-direction.
2. The MSC Server performs interworking between the I2 reference point and CS signalling. It also controls a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform interworking between CS access bearers and RTP bearers on the Mb reference point.
3. For emergency sessions, the MSC Server may perform existing MSC Server emergency call handling procedures or interworking with IMS.
4. For video call originating sessions that use CS media, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs video codec negotiation for the non ICS UE and sets up the video media bearer based on defined procedures.
5. The SCC AS is inserted in the IMS session path using the iFC.

Example call flows for session origination by an ICS UE where the I1 reference point is not required to set up the session and a MSC Server enhanced for ICS is used to set up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path are provided in the relevant figures. For sessions where the MSC Server enhanced for ICS is not used, alternative call flows are shown in other figures.","The answer must include the detailed steps of the call flow for IMS origination via CS access for non ICS UE, highlighting the roles of MSC Server, S-CSCF, and SCC AS. It should also cover the utilization of IMS service control for non ICS UEs, interworking between I2 reference point and CS signalling, control of CS-MGW, handling of emergency sessions, and video codec negotiation. Additionally, it should describe the procedure for ICS UE dialing E.164 number, Tel URI, or SIP-URI user=phone, and the routing to IMS via MSC Server enhanced for ICS, including example call flows for session origination without I1 reference point."
"Describe the key elements and functionalities of telepresence conferencing systems, focusing on spatial relationships, media information, and interoperability.","Telepresence conferencing systems are designed to create a more immersive and realistic communication experience by accurately reproducing the spatial arrangement of objects and participants in a capture scene. 

Spatial relationships are crucial in telepresence systems as they represent the arrangement in space of video and audio sources. For video, spatial descriptions include the order of images in the captured scene, which can be in two or three dimensions, allowing the receiver to reproduce the original scene accurately. For audio, spatial descriptions involve details such as the point of capture, line of capture, and capture sensitivity patterns (e.g., omni, shotgun, cardioid, hyper-cardioid), ensuring spatially correct audio reproduction. Additionally, spatial matching between audio and video streams from a specific party is necessary for a coherent experience.

Enhanced media information in telepresence IM sessions includes the introduction of source components of media captures, such as original media captures from cameras or composed media captures indicating a mix of audio streams. This information allows the sender to describe the sources and the receiver to choose which media captures they want to see. For example, a telepresence unit (TP UE) can provide a single capture representing the active speaker based on voice activity detection, along with other captures composed as a picture in picture. Simultaneity constraints, such as the inability to simultaneously obtain zoomed-in and zoomed-out views from a room camera, are also part of the enhanced media information.

The detailed information described above is used to improve the experience during IM sessions between parties with different capabilities, such as varying numbers of devices, picture aspect ratios, or media streams. The TP UE can provide multiple video captures, and the negotiation message must contain enough parameters to describe the characteristics of each capture, such as spatial view, media composition, and person information. Protocols adopted for IM sessions supporting telepresence ensure interoperability by handling multiple streams in a standardized way, enabling seamless communication between different systems.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Explanation of spatial relationships in telepresence systems, including how video and audio spatial descriptions are used for rendering.
  - Description of enhanced media information, including source components and the ability for receivers to choose media captures.
  - Discussion on the usage of detailed information for improving IM session experiences, including negotiation parameters and interoperability protocols."
"Describe the procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS (MO-SMS) via T4 and T8 interfaces, and explain the role of the SCEF and MTC-IWF in these procedures.","The procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS (MO-SMS) via T4 and T8 interfaces involve several steps and interactions between different network elements. 

For the T4 interface:
1. The User Equipment (UE) uses the Short Message Mobile Originated procedure to deliver small data to the Service Capability Server/Application Server (SCS/AS). The service center address points to the SMS Service Center (SMS-SC), and the destination SME address is set to the short/long code of the SCS/AS. The Application Port ID element of the TP-User-Data field is set to an appropriate value.
2. For MSISDN-less subscriptions, the MSC/VLR/MME/SGSN/IP-SM-GW uses a dummy MSISDN. This MSISDN and the IMSI of the UE are sent using the existing SMS delivery procedure to the SMS-SC.
3. The SMS-SC indicates to the UE that it has successfully received the SMS message using the existing SMS Submit Report.
4. The SMS-SC uses the destination SME address to identify the corresponding Machine Type Communication Interworking Function (MTC-IWF) based on a pre-configured mapping table. The SMS-SC extracts the SMS payload, Application Port ID, and IMSI of the UE and delivers them to the MTC-IWF via T4 along with the destination SME address.
5-6. Over the S6m interface, the MTC-IWF uses the IMSI of the UE and Application Port ID to query the Home Subscriber Server/Home Location Register (HSS/HLR) for the external ID.
7. Over the Tsp interface, the MTC-IWF forwards the SMS payload, external ID, and Application Port ID to the SCS/AS. The payload is delivered directly to the SCS/AS, not processed by the MTC-IWF.
8. Via T4, the MTC-IWF returns a success or failure delivery indication to the SMS-SC.
9. The SMS-SC indicates the success or failure of the delivery of the SMS to the target back to the UE using the existing SMS Status Report.

For the T8 interface:
1. The UE sends an SMS to the SCS/AS. The UE, MSC/MME/SGSN, and SMS-SC execute steps 1 and 2 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure. The SMS-SC uses the destination SME address to identify the corresponding Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) based on a pre-configured mapping table. The SMS-SC extracts the SMS payload, Application Port ID, and IMSI of the UE and delivers them to the SCEF via T4 along with the destination SME address.
2. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes steps 4-5 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure.
3. The SCEF sends a MO SMS Submit Request (SMS payload, external ID, and Application Port ID) to the SCS/AS. The payload is delivered directly to the SCS/AS, not processed by the SCEF.
4. The SCS/AS sends a MO SMS Submit Response to the SCEF.
5. The SCEF/MTC-IWF executes step 7 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure. The SMS delivery or failure report is delivered to the UE as shown in step 8 of the MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 procedure.

The MSISDN-less MO-SMS service allows a UE without an MSISDN but with an External Identifier (username@realm) to send small data to an SCS/AS using SMS-MO. The SMS-MO received by the SMS-SC through the MO submission procedure is directly forwarded to the SCEF for further transfer to the recipient SCS/AS. The SCEF queries the HSS with the IMSI of the UE, obtains the corresponding External Identifier of the UE sending the SMS, and forwards the SMS to the SCS/AS including the External Identifier of the originating UE.

In summary, the T4 procedure involves the MTC-IWF for querying the HSS/HLR and forwarding the SMS payload, while the T8 procedure involves the SCEF for similar functions. The key difference is the involvement of the SCEF in the T8 procedure, which handles the forwarding of the SMS payload to the SCS/AS.","The answer must include a detailed description of the steps involved in both T4 and T8 procedures for MSISDN-less MO-SMS, highlighting the roles of each network element (UE, MSC/VLR/MME/SGSN/IP-SM-GW, SMS-SC, MTC-IWF, SCEF, and SCS/AS). It should explain the use of dummy MSISDN, the extraction and forwarding of SMS payload, Application Port ID, and IMSI, and the querying of HSS/HLR for the External Identifier. The differences between the T4 and T8 procedures, particularly the involvement of SCEF in the T8 procedure, should be clearly outlined."

Explain the relationship and configuration possibilities between RABs and SRBs in the context of 3GPP TS 25.993 specifications.,"In the context of 3GPP TS 25.993 specifications, Radio Access Bearers (RABs) and Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) play crucial roles in the communication between the Core Network (CN) and the User Equipment (UE) through the Radio Network Controller (RNC).

RABs are defined to provide specific data rates for uplink and downlink communication. Document 1 specifies the typical maximum RAB data rates independently for uplink and downlink, which are part of the 'RAB parameters' received by the RNC in the RANAP: RAB ASSIGNMENT messages. These rates must be mandatorily provided from the CN (SGSN) to the UTRAN (RNC), and any combination of the listed example data rates is possible.

SRBs, on the other hand, are used for signalling purposes. Document 2 provides examples of SRBs and their configurations as defined in clauses 7, 8, and 9. These bearers are essential for the control and management of the radio resources.

Document 3 explains that any combination of the listed RABs in clause 5 is possible. Based on the selected RAB or RAB combination, the Radio Resource Management (RRM) inside the RNC selects appropriate Radio Bearers (RB) from clauses 7, 8, or 9. For a valid configuration, the SRB listed in subclause 5.4 can exist alone or be combined with one or multiple RABs from subclauses 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. Configuration limitations are defined in clause 5.

In summary, RABs provide the necessary data rates for user data transmission, while SRBs handle signalling. The RRM in the RNC is responsible for selecting the appropriate RBs based on the chosen RABs, ensuring that configurations are valid and adhere to the defined limitations.","The answer should cover the following key points:

Describe the roles and functionalities of the ProSe Function and ProSe Proxy Function in the context of Proximity Services as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303.,"The ProSe Function is a logical function used for network-related actions required for Proximity Services (ProSe). It consists of three main sub-functions, each performing different roles depending on the ProSe feature:

1. Direct Provisioning Function (DPF): This sub-function provisions the User Equipment (UE) with necessary parameters to use ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication. It provides PLMN-specific parameters for ProSe usage and, for public safety, provisions the UE with parameters needed when not served by E-UTRAN. It also generates and maintains the ProSe Discovery UE ID (PDUID) for restricted ProSe Direct Discovery.

2. Direct Discovery Name Management Function: This sub-function handles open ProSe Direct Discovery by allocating and processing the mapping of ProSe Application IDs and ProSe Application Codes. It uses ProSe-related subscriber data stored in the HSS for authorization of discovery requests and provides the UE with security material to protect discovery messages. For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, it interacts with the Application Server for authorization.

3. EPC-level Discovery ProSe Function: This sub-function has reference points towards the Application Server (PC2), other ProSe Functions (PC6), the HSS (PC4a), and the UE (PC3). It stores and retrieves ProSe-related subscriber data, authorizes and configures the UE for EPC-level ProSe Discovery, and handles EPC ProSe User IDs and Application Layer User IDs. It also supports WLAN direct discovery and communication, acts as a location services client, and exchanges signaling with third-party Application Servers and ProSe Functions in other PLMNs.

The ProSe Function interfaces include:
- PC2: Towards the Application Server for application registration and identifier mapping.
- PC3: Towards the UE for EPC-level ProSe Discovery and WLAN direct discovery.
- PC4a: Towards the HSS for ProSe-related subscriber data.
- PC6: Towards other ProSe Functions for proximity requests, alerts, and location reporting.

The ProSe Proxy Function enables communication between the UE and the Home ProSe Function/ProSe Key Management Function when they are not located in the same network as the PDN GW for the PDN connection being used. It is implemented in the VPLMN on the SGi interface to forward signaling traffic between the UE and the Home ProSe Function. It can also be implemented in either the HPLMN or VPLMN to reach a ProSe Key Management Function in a different network. The ProSe Proxy Function is necessary when security requirements are not met by signaling over the Internet, and it ensures that only tunneled server-to-server traffic is sent between networks.

In summary, the ProSe Function handles provisioning, discovery, and communication for ProSe services, while the ProSe Proxy Function facilitates secure communication between the UE and ProSe-related functions across different networks.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The ProSe Function's roles and sub-functions, including Direct Provisioning, Direct Discovery Name Management, and EPC-level Discovery.

Explain the role and functionality of the OCB_flag in managing Call Barring services for MSP subscribers as described in 3GPP TS 23.097.,"The OCB_flag plays a crucial role in managing Call Barring services for MSP (Multi-Subscriber Profile) subscribers within the 3GPP TS 23.097 framework. The OCB_flag is set in the Home Location Register (HLR) if Call Barrings are provided in the gsmSCF (GSM Service Control Function). When the OCB_flag is set, it dictates the behavior of the HLR based on the support of CAMEL (Customized Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic) Phase 2 or later by the Visitor Location Register (VLR) where the subscriber is roaming.

If the subscriber roams to a VLR that supports CAMEL Phase 2 or later, the HLR will not send any outgoing call barring supplementary services data to the VLR. Conversely, if the subscriber roams to a VLR that does not support CAMEL Phase 2 or later, the HLR will send the outgoing call barring supplementary services data as stored in the HLR to the VLR. Additionally, the subscriber is not allowed to alter the Call Barring data in the HLR.

Call Barring Supplementary Services can be provisioned per subscriber, but equivalent services implemented in the gsmSCF can be provided to MSP subscribers per profile. These services include barring of all outgoing calls (BAOC), barring of outgoing international calls (BOIC), barring of outgoing international calls except those directed to the home PLMN country (BOIC-exHC), barring of all incoming calls (BAIC), and barring of incoming calls when roaming outside the home PLMN country (BIC-roam).

MSP subscribers have control over the call barring data, including registration, erasure, activation, deactivation, and interrogation. If an MSP subscriber changes the outgoing call barrings for the default profile by contacting the gsmSCF, the gsmSCF will update the barrings stored in the gsmSCF and inform the HLR using ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) to change the barrings stored in the HLR. The use of a password for changing Call Barring data is a network option.

The operator must ensure that if an equivalent call barring service is provided, the OCB_flag is set in the HLR. The state of the outgoing call barring service in the gsmSCF for the default profile must be synchronized with the HLR, ensuring that if the service is ","The answer should include:

What are the requirements for CGI identification and reporting for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED state configured with SA operation mode according to 3GPP specifications?,"The requirements for CGI identification and reporting for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED state configured with SA operation mode are detailed in the 3GPP specifications. The UE must identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when requested by the network. This process involves several key steps and conditions:

1. **Conditions for CGI Identification**: The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when requested by the network. The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 messages. Autonomous gaps are not required if useAutonomousGaps is set to false.

2. **Use of Autonomous Gaps**: If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of an NR cell within a specific time period, Tidentify_CGI_redcap, which is calculated as the sum of TMIB_redcap and TSIB1_redcap. TMIB_redcap is the time period used to acquire the MIB message, and TSIB1_redcap is the time period used to acquire the SIB1 message.

3. **Time Periods for Acquiring MIB and SIB1 Messages**: 
   - TMIB_redcap = 6 * TSMTC ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR1.
   - TSIB1_redcap = 12 * TRMSI-scheduling ms.

4. **Calculation of Tidentify_CGI_redcap**: Tidentify_CGI_redcap is the sum of TMIB_redcap and TSIB1_redcap. This time period is applicable when no DRX is used as well as when any of the DRX cycles specified in the relevant 3GPP specifications are used.

5. **Interruption Requirements**: During the time Tidentify_CGI_redcap, the UE must fulfill interruption requirements specified in the relevant clauses of the 3GPP specifications. These interruptions are necessary to ensure accurate CGI identification.

6. **CGI Reporting Delay**: The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between the command that triggers a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This delay should be less than Tidentify_CGI_redcap plus the RRC procedure delay defined in the relevant 3GPP specifications.

7. **Specific Interruption Lengths and Conditions**: When a RedCap UE is identifying CGI of an NR cell with autonomous gaps, the UE is not expected to transmit or receive certain signals during specific slots. The interruption lengths and conditions are detailed in the relevant tables of the 3GPP specifications.

Overall, these requirements ensure that the UE can accurately identify and report the CGI of an NR target cell while adhering to the specified time periods and interruption conditions.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The conditions under which a UE identifies and reports the CGI of an NR target cell.
  - The use of autonomous gaps for receiving MIB and SIB1 messages.
  - The time periods TMIB_redcap and TSIB1_redcap for acquiring MIB and SIB1 messages.
  - The calculation of Tidentify_CGI_redcap.
  - The interruption requirements during CGI identification.
  - The definition and calculation of CGI reporting delay.

   - For transmitter tests, a 5 MHz carrier is placed adjacent to the upper and lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. If 5 MHz carriers are not supported by the Base Station, the narrowest supported channel bandwidth is selected instead.
   - For receiver tests, a 5 MHz carrier is placed adjacent to the upper and lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. If 5 MHz E-UTRA carriers are not supported by the Base Station, the narrowest supported channel bandwidth is selected instead.
   - For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at least 15 MHz plus two times the channel bandwidth used in the previous step and the Base Station supports at least 4 carriers, a carrier of this bandwidth is placed adjacent to each already placed carrier for each sub-block. The nominal carrier spacing defined in subclause 5.7 applies.
   - The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap are determined using the specified FOffset for the carrier adjacent to the sub-block gap.

3. **ETC8 Construction Method**:
   - ETC8 is constructed using the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth.

"Describe the positioning methods and their operations as defined in the 3GPP TS 38.305 specification, focusing on OTDOA and TBS.","The 3GPP TS 38.305 specification outlines two primary positioning methods: OTDOA (Observed Time Difference of Arrival) and TBS (Terrestrial Beacon System).

The OTDOA positioning method involves the UE (User Equipment) measuring the timing of downlink signals received from multiple Transmission Points (TPs), which include eNBs, ng-eNBs, and PRS-only TPs. The UE uses assistance data received from the positioning server to measure the timing of these signals. The resulting measurements are then used to determine the UE's location relative to the neighboring TPs. The detailed operation of the OTDOA method is described in clause 8.2 of the specification.

The Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS) consists of a network of ground-based transmitters that broadcast signals solely for positioning purposes. The current types of TBS positioning signals include Metropolitan Beacon System (MBS) signals and Positioning Reference Signals (PRS). The UE measures the received TBS signals, optionally aided by assistance data, to calculate its location or to send measurements to the positioning server for position calculation. The operation of the TBS positioning method based on MBS signals is detailed in clause 8.7, while PRS-based TBS positioning is part of OTDOA positioning and described in clause 8.2.

TBS supports three positioning modes:
1. UE-Assisted: The UE performs TBS measurements with or without assistance from the network and sends these measurements to the Location Management Function (LMF) where the position calculation takes place, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources.
2. UE-Based: The UE performs TBS measurements and calculates its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources.
3. Standalone: The UE performs TBS measurements and calculates its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources, without network assistance.

These positioning methods and their operations provide robust mechanisms for determining the location of UEs in various environments.","The answer should cover the following key details:

What are the requirements and test configurations for NR base stations as defined in TS 38.113?,"The requirements and test configurations for NR base stations as defined in TS 38.113 include several key aspects. Firstly, the requirements are defined separately for different frequency ranges, specifically FR1 and FR2, which are detailed in subclause 5.1 of TS 38.104. The equipment must be tested in a normal test environment specified in the corresponding BS conformance testing specifications: TS 38.141-1 for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H, and TS 38.141-2 for BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O. The test conditions must be recorded in the test report.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements apply to each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. The operating bands must be activated according to the test configuration in subclause 4.5, and tests must be performed for each type of port, assessing all operating bands during the tests.

3. **RSRP Measurements**: The UE must be capable of performing RSRP measurements for 6 identified intra-frequency cells and reporting these measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of Tmeasure_intra_UE cat M1.

4. **Measurement Reporting Delay**: The measurement reporting delay is the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface. This delay should be less than Tidentify_intra_UE cat M1, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling on the DCCH and the delay uncertainty from inserting the report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. Additional delays can be expected when L3 filtering is used or IDC autonomous denial is configured.

5. **Event Triggered Reporting**: If a cell becomes undetectable for ≤ 5 seconds and then detectable again, triggering an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay should be less than Tmeasure_intra_UE cat M1, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than 50 Ts and L3 filtering has not been used. Additional delays can be expected with L3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial.

6. **Applicability to Other Categories**: The requirements explicitly refer to Category M1 but are also applicable to Category M2 and non-BL/CE UEs, pending further discussion in RAN4 to update the wording.

These requirements ensure that UEs can effectively identify and measure HD-FDD intra-frequency cells under various conditions, maintaining reliable communication and performance standards.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The conditions under which a cell is considered detectable, referencing RSRP and SCH_RP/SCH Ês/Iot requirements from 3GPP TS 36.133.
  - The measurement periods for intra-frequency measurements (Tmeasure_intra_UE cat M1) for both DRX and eDRX_CONN cycles.
  - The requirement for the UE to perform RSRP measurements for 6 identified intra-frequency cells and report these measurements to higher layers.

"Describe the coding process for both downlink and uplink data in the context of 3GPP TS 45.003 specifications, including parity bits, tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.","The coding process for both downlink and uplink data in the context of 3GPP TS 45.003 specifications involves several steps, including the definition of parity bits, addition of tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.

For downlink data coding, the process begins with the definition of twelve data parity bits p(0), p(1), ..., p(11). These parity bits are calculated such that the binary polynomial formed by the data bits and parity bits, when divided by a specific polynomial, yields a remainder equal to a predefined polynomial. Specifically, for the downlink data coding described in TS 45.003 5.1.9.1.4, the polynomial formed by the data bits d(28) to d(477) and parity bits p(0) to p(11) is divided by D12 + D11 + D10 + D8 + D5 + D4 + 1, resulting in a remainder of D11 + D10 + D9 + D8 + D7 + D6 + D5 + D4 + D3 + D2 + D + 1.

Next, six tail bits equal to 0 are added to the information and parity bits, resulting in a block of 468 bits {u(0), u(1), ..., u(467)}. The bits are assigned as follows: u(k) = d(k+28) for k = 0, 1, ..., 449; u(k) = p(k-450) for k = 450, 451, ..., 461; and u(k) = 0 for k = 462, 463, ..., 467 (tail bits).

This block of 468 bits is then encoded using a 1/3 rate convolutional mother code defined by the polynomials G4 = 1 + D2 + D3 + D5 + D6, G7 = 1 + D + D2 + D3 + D6, and G5 = 1 + D + D4 + D6. The encoding process results in a block of 1404 coded bits {C(0), C(1), ..., C(1403)}, where each coded bit is calculated based on the convolutional polynomials.

The code is punctured depending on the value of the CPS field, resulting in a block of 1248 coded bits {dc(0), dc(1), ..., dc(1247)}. For the FANR procedure, the code is further punctured based on the CPS field and the PANI field, resulting in a block of 1172 coded bits {pc(0), pc(1), ..., pc(1171)}.

For uplink data coding, the process is similar to downlink data coding but with different sets of bits. According to TS 45.003 5.1.9.2.3, the bits {d(28), d(29), ..., d(477)} used in downlink are replaced by bits {d(37), d(38), ..., d(486)} for uplink data coding.

Similarly, for another set of bits described in TS 45.003 5.1.10.1.4, the downlink data coding process involves the definition of twelve data parity bits p(0), p(1), ..., p(11) for bits d(28) to d(621). The polynomial formed by these bits is divided by D12 + D11 + D10 + D8 + D5 + D4 + 1, yielding the same remainder as before. Six tail bits are added, resulting in a block of 612 bits {u(0), u(1), ..., u(611)}. This block is encoded using the same convolutional polynomials, resulting in a block of 1836 coded bits {C(0), C(1), ..., C(1835)}. The code is punctured based on the CPS field, resulting in a block of 1248 coded bits {dc(0), dc(1), ..., dc(1247)}. For the FANR procedure, further puncturing based on the CPS and PANI fields results in a block of 1172 coded bits {pc(0), pc(1), ..., pc(1171)}.

For uplink data coding in this context, as specified in TS 45.003 5.1.10.2.3, the bits {d(28), d(29), ..., d(621)} used in downlink are replaced by bits {d(37), d(38), ..., d(630)}.

In summary, the coding process for both downlink and uplink data involves defining parity bits, adding tail bits, performing convolutional encoding with specified polynomials, and applying puncturing schemes based on specific fields. The main difference between downlink and uplink coding is the replacement of certain bits in the process.","The answer should include a comprehensive explanation of the coding process for both downlink and uplink data. It should cover the definition and calculation of parity bits, the addition of tail bits, the convolutional encoding process with specified polynomials, and the puncturing schemes applied.

"Describe the PDCP testing methodology as outlined in 3GPP TS 34.123, including the test modes, steps, and protocols involved.","The PDCP testing methodology as outlined in 3GPP TS 34.123 involves several key components and steps. The single party test method is used for PDCP testing, where all tests requiring uplink data utilize the UE test loop mode 1. This mode is only available in the user plane, so all PDCP tests are performed in the user plane using the same logical channels mapped to transport channels, except for the specific configuration of combined radio bearers used in test case clause 7.3.2.2.4.

Separation of TTCN test cases from the configuration of the tester and initialization of the UE is achieved through the use of test steps. For PDCP test cases, both common and newly defined test steps for PDCP configuration are used to perform the configuration of the tester and the appropriate generic setup procedures as described in clause 7.3. These test steps utilize Protocol Control Objects (PCOs) such as AM, UM, CRLC, CMAC, and CPHY. Additionally, NAS TTCN test steps are used to set up a PS session.

For optimization, the IP Header Compression protocol as described in RFC 2507 is used. This involves the transmission and reception of uncompressed, compressed, and decompressed IP header packets, as well as UDP/IP header packets. PDCP testing includes PDCP sequence numbering, lossless SRNS relocation, and PID assignment rules. However, it does not test optimization-specific protocol behaviors such as error recovery and packet reordering.

"Describe the process and requirements for publishing service APIs at the CAPIF core function and other CAPIF core functions, including the necessary HTTP POST message structure, verification steps, and resource creation.","The process for publishing service APIs at the CAPIF core function involves several steps and requirements. Firstly, the API publishing function must send an HTTP POST message to the CAPIF core function, with the body of the message including API Information as specified in clause 8.2.2.2.3.1. Upon receiving this message, the CAPIF core function verifies the identity of the API publishing function and checks if it is authorized to publish service APIs. If authorized, the CAPIF core function then verifies the API Information in the HTTP POST message and adds the service APIs to the API registry. If topology hiding is enabled, the CAPIF core function determines the service APIs requiring topology hiding, identifies the API exposing functions responsible for topology hiding, creates API topology hiding information, replaces the API exposing function information in the service API information, sends a notification message to the responsible API exposing functions, and stores the API topology hiding information. Additionally, the CAPIF core function creates a new resource using the service API information, sends a notification message to all API Invokers subscribed to the Service API Update event, and returns the CAPIF Resource URI in the response message.

The structure for Resource URIs and the resources and methods used for the service are depicted in Figure 8.2.2.1-1 and detailed in Table 8.2.2.1-1.

For publishing service APIs at other CAPIF core functions, the CAPIF core function sends an HTTP POST message to the peer CAPIF core function, including API Information and the published API path 'pubApiPath' as specified in clause 8.2.4.2.2. The CAPIF core function verifies the identity of the requesting CAPIF core function and checks if it is authorized to publish service APIs. If authorized, it checks if its own identifier is within the published API path and adds it if not present. The CAPIF core function then verifies the rest of the API Information, adds the service APIs to the API registry, creates a new resource, sends a notification message to all API Invokers subscribed to the Service API Update event, and returns the CAPIF Resource URI in the response message.

- **Area-Specific Delivery**: Authorized application servers or UEs must be able to send broadcast messages to all UEs within a specific area configured according to application policy.

Regarding data delivery methods, the MSGin5G Service must consider:
- **Existing Methods**: Whether it uses existing control plane and user plane data delivery methods or requires new or enhanced methods.
- **Access Methods**: Whether it uses existing methods (e.g., N6, T8, and Nnef) to access user plane and/or control plane data delivery methods or requires new or enhanced methods.

"Describe the procedure and requirements for including the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header in HTTP requests and responses between NF (Service) instances, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.500.","The 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header is used to convey the IDs of the NF (service) instance acting as the HTTP client and the NF (service) instance acting as the HTTP server. The encoding of this header follows the ABNF format defined in IETF RFC 7230. The header structure is as follows: 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info = '3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info' ':' OWS peerinfo *(';' OWS peerinfo), where peerinfo consists of peertype '=' token.

The types of peer information that can be included in the header are:
- srcinst: Source NF Instance ID
- srcservinst: Source NF Service Instance ID (requires srcinst to be present)
- srcscp: FQDN of the Source SCP (included only by an SCP)
- srcsepp: FQDN of the Source SEPP (included only by a SEPP)
- dstinst: Destination NF Instance ID
- dstservinst: Destination NF Service Instance ID (requires dstinst to be present)
- dstscp: FQDN of the Destination SCP (included by SCPs, SEPPs, or clients/servers sending requests/responses to an SCP)
- dstsepp: FQDN of the Destination SEPP (included by SCPs, SEPPs, or clients/servers sending requests/responses to a SEPP)

The procedure for obtaining source and destination information of messages exchanged between NF (Service) instances is designed to enable network elements such as NFs, SCPs, SEPPs, network analytics tools, or probes to identify the HTTP requests or responses between a specified pair of NF (Service) instances.

An HTTP client originating a request should include the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header with the Source NF (Service) instance ID and, if available, the Destination NF (Service) instance ID. Upon receiving a request with this header, the HTTP server should insert the header in the response, swapping the source and destination peer info. The HTTP server should include the header in the response even if it was not present in the request. If the destination peer information provided by the HTTP client does not match the HTTP server's information, the server should update the NF (Service) instance ID values in the response header.

When forwarding a request or response with the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header, the SCP should forward the header and may update the destination peer info if the receiver NF is reselected. The SCP must also update the srcscp/dstscp components based on the source and destination SCP of the forwarded HTTP request or response. The SEPP should update the dstscp component if it relays the request towards an SCP. In inter-PLMN scenarios, the SEPP may remove the header based on operator policies. If an SCP or SEPP generates an error response to a request with this header, they should insert the header in the response with source peer info containing their information and destination peer info containing the source peer info from the request.","The answer should include:
- The structure and encoding of the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header as defined in TS 29.500 5.2.3.2.21.

"Explain the process and requirements for generating xCC in a CC-POI based on the information received in LI_T3 triggers, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.128.","The process of generating xCC in a CC-POI based on the information received in LI_T3 triggers involves several steps and requirements. Firstly, the CC-POI uses the H248ContextID received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask trigger to match the Context ID seen in the H.248 transactions with the Network Function (NF) that has the CC-TF. Additionally, the CC-POI uses the IP address and UDP port number received as target identifiers in the LI_T3 trigger, along with the TriggerScope also received in the LI_T3 trigger, to identify the media packets to be intercepted for the generation of xCC.

When the TriggerScope value received in the LI_T3 trigger is 'Unidirectional', the IP address and UDP port number received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask as target identifiers must match the destination IP address and UDP port number of the media packets. Conversely, when the TriggerScope value is 'Bidirectional', the IP address and UDP port number received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask as target identifiers must match the destination IP address and UDP port number of the incoming media packets and the source IP address and UDP port number of outgoing media packets in the reverse direction.

For 'Unidirectional' TriggerScope, the CC-POI expects to receive two LI_T3 ActivateTask triggers, which provide the necessary information to identify the media in both directions of the media flow. The H248ContextID and CorrelationID in the two triggers are the same. Media packets destined to the local IP address and UDP port number are referred to as incoming media packets, while those destined to the remote IP address and UDP port number are referred to as outgoing media packets.

The CC-POI generates the SDP Session Description field of xCC from the LocalSDP and RemoteSDP received in the LI_T3 trigger from the CC-TF. When the TriggerScope value is 'Bidirectional', the CC-POI may receive the LocalSDP and RemoteSDP in one LI_T3 trigger or in two separate LI_T3 triggers. For 'Unidirectional' TriggerScope, the LocalSDP and RemoteSDP are received in two separate triggers. The LocalSDP is included in the SDP Session Description field of the xCC generated from the incoming media packets, while the RemoteSDP is included in the Session Description field of xCC from the outgoing media packets.

The LocalSDP provides the SDP information expected by the IMS Media Function that has the CC-POI, and the media packets sent by the remote end of the media flow are based on this SDP information. Therefore, the LocalSDP is associated with the incoming media packets. The RemoteSDP provides the SDP information expected by the remote end of the media flow, and the media packets sent to that remote end are based on this SDP information. Therefore, the RemoteSDP is associated with the outgoing media packets.

The SDP Session Description field must be included in the xCC each time a new LocalSDP or RemoteSDP is received in the LI_T3 trigger from the CC-TF.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how the CC-POI uses H248ContextID, IP address, and UDP port number to identify media packets.

"Describe the handling of criticality information in SBc-AP messages, including the actions taken by the receiving node based on different criticality values and scenarios involving missing IEs/IE groups.","In SBc-AP messages, criticality information plays a crucial role in guiding the receiving node on how to handle individual Information Elements (IEs) and IE groups, especially when they are not comprehended or missing. The criticality information is defined in clause 4.5.3.2 and includes three possible values: 'Reject IE', 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', and 'Ignore IE'.

1. **Reject IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE', the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information received is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the procedure is terminated, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

2. **Ignore IE and Notify Sender**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The missing IEs are reported in the response message, or if insufficient information is received, the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages, the procedure continues, and the missing IEs are reported via the Error Indication procedure.

3. **Ignore IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The same applies to response messages.

The rules for comprehension of IEs, IE groups, and EPs are as follows:
- When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity, although some may remain unsupported.
- The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any unsupported EP may be considered not comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.

"Describe the mechanisms and headers involved in redirecting HTTP requests within 3GPP network functions, including AMF, SCP, and SEPP redirections.","In 3GPP network functions, HTTP request redirection mechanisms are crucial for efficient communication and load balancing. These mechanisms involve specific headers and procedures for redirecting requests within AMF sets, SCPs, and SEPPs.

1. **AMF Redirection**:
   - An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance within the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set. This redirection can occur when an AMF service instance is part of an AMF set or when using indirect communications.
   - When an SCP reselects a different AMF producer instance, it returns the NF Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the `3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id` header.
   - If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of the set using a `307 Temporary Redirect` or `308 Permanent Redirect` status code, the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected is indicated in the `3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id` header.

2. **Feature Negotiation Mechanism**:
   - The feature negotiation mechanism between the AMF and the NF Service Consumer is specified to negotiate optional features applicable for the Namf_Communication service.
   - The NF Service Consumer indicates the optional features it supports by including the `supportedFeatures` attribute in the payload of the HTTP Request Message for specific service operations such as N1N2MessageTransfer, N1N2MessageSubscribe, NonUeN2InfoSubscribe, UeContextTransfer, and CreateUEContext.
   - The AMF determines the supported features for the service operations and indicates them by including the `supportedFeatures` attribute in the payload of the HTTP response.

3. **SCP and SEPP Redirection**:
   - HTTP requests sent using indirect communication may be redirected to a different target NF service instance or SCP. The URI of the target NF service instance is provided by the `Location` header field of the `307 Temporary Redirect` or `308 Permanent Redirect` response.
   - When redirecting a request to a different NF instance, the NF (service) instance ID of the target NF (service) instance is indicated in the `3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id` header.
   - An SCP may redirect an HTTP request towards a different SCP by sending a `307 Temporary Redirect` or `308 Permanent Redirect` response with a `RedirectResponse` data structure, including the cause attribute set to `SCP_REDIRECTION` and the `targetScp` attribute indicating the apiRoot of the SCP towards which the request is redirected.
   - Similarly, a SEPP may redirect an HTTP request towards a different SEPP by sending a `307 Temporary Redirect` or `308 Permanent Redirect` response with a `RedirectResponse` data structure, including the cause attribute set to `SEPP_REDIRECTION` and the `targetSepp` attribute indicating the apiRoot of the SEPP towards which the request is redirected.

These redirection mechanisms and feature negotiations ensure seamless communication and efficient handling of requests within 3GPP network functions, adapting to various scenarios such as load balancing, service instance selection, and indirect communication.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Explanation of HTTP request redirection within AMF sets, including the use of 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id and 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id headers.
- Description of the feature negotiation mechanism between AMF and NF Service Consumer, including the supportedFeatures attribute in HTTP request and response messages.
- Detailed mechanisms of HTTP request redirection using indirect communication, including the use of Location header, 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header, and RedirectResponse data structure with cause attributes SCP_REDIRECTION and SEPP_REDIRECTION.
- Examples of scenarios where these redirections and negotiations are applicable."
How should references be handled in multi-part 3GPP TS or TR documents according to TS 21.801?,"According to TS 21.801, references in multi-part 3GPP TS or TR documents should be handled with care, following specific guidelines depending on the system used for subdividing the document into parts. There are two systems for subdividing into parts:

Describe the key elements and coding specifications for transaction identifiers and data connection status change events as defined in 3GPP TS 31.111.,"Transaction identifiers are used to uniquely identify calls and data connections in mobile communication systems. According to 3GPP TS 31.111, the transaction identifier list is a variable-length list where each byte defines a transaction identifier, and no identifier should appear more than once within the list.

The coding specifications for transaction identifiers are as follows:
- Bits 1 to 4 are reserved for future use (RFU).
- Bits 5 to 7 represent the TI value, which is an identifier generated by the terminal.
- Bit 8 is the TI flag, which indicates the status of the call or data connection event.

For terminals supporting IMS:
- The TI value uniquely identifies the call.
- The TI flag is set to '1' for call connected events, '0' for mobile terminated (MT) call events, and '0' or '1' for call disconnected events depending on who disconnects the call.

For terminals not supporting IMS:
- The TI value and TI flag are coded as defined in TS 24.007.
- The TI flag is set based on the corresponding call connect, call setup, or disconnect message.

In the case of data connection status change events:
- The TI value uniquely identifies the PDP, PDN, or PDU data connection.
- The TI flag is always set to '0'.

The data connection status change event involves several parameters and data objects:
- Event list: Contains only one event, set to Data Connection Status Change.
- Device identities: Set to Network for network-originated messages and ME for ME-originated messages, with the destination set to UICC.
- Data connection status: Indicates the status of the data connection.
- Data connection type: Specifies the type of data connection.
- (E/5G)SM cause: Contains the SM, ESM, or 5GSM cause if available.
- Transaction identifier: Contains one transaction identifier as defined in clause 8.28.
- Date-Time and Time zone: Mandatory if available, indicating the moment of occurrence of the event.
- Location Information: Contains the identification of the current serving cell, mandatory if the data connection is over specific networks.
- Access Technology: Indicates the access technology of the network.
- Location Status: Indicates the current service state of the terminal.
- Network Access Name: Contains the Access Point Name or Data Network Name value, present only when the data connection status is successful or rejected.
- PDP/PDN/PDU type: Specifies the type requested in the relevant activation request, present only when the data connection status is successful or rejected.

Additionally, the Media Type data element indicates the media type of the communication and is coded as a bitmap.

Class 'q' support may impact transaction identifier handling, as specified in clause 7.5.3.

Overall, these elements and coding specifications ensure accurate identification and handling of calls and data connections in mobile communication systems.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Definition and purpose of transaction identifiers.

Describe the interworking principles and parameter handling for handover and relocation procedures between different protocols as specified in 3GPP TS 29.010.,"The interworking principles and parameter handling for handover and relocation procedures between different protocols as specified in 3GPP TS 29.010 are as follows:

1. **General Principles for Handover Procedures**:
   - The general principles of handover procedures are outlined in TS 23.009. TS 29.010 provides the necessary information for interworking between various protocols such as TS 48.008 handover protocol, TS 25.413 RANAP protocol, and TS 29.002 MAP protocol.

2. **Interworking for Inter-MSC Handover UMTS to GSM**:
   - The BSSMAP parameters required for Inter-MSC handover from UMTS to GSM are generated as in GSM.
   - Received BSSMAP parameters, such as cause code or handover command, are mapped to the appropriate RANAP parameters, such as cause code transparent container to the source RNS.
   - When new parameters need to be added for transfer on the E-interface, the principles stated in clause 4.5 of TS 29.010 should be followed.

3. **Interworking for Inter-MSC Handover GSM to UMTS**:
   - The BSSMAP parameters required for Inter-MSC handover from GSM to UMTS are generated as in GSM.
   - Received RANAP parameters, such as cause code or transparent container, are mapped to the appropriate BSSMAP parameters, such as cause code or handover command.
   - The RANAP parameters required for Inter-MSC handover from GSM to UMTS are generated from received or stored GSM parameters.
   - When new parameters need to be added for transfer on the E-interface, the principles stated in clause 4.5 of TS 29.010 should be followed.

4. **Interworking for Intra UMTS Handovers**:
   - For intra UMTS handovers, RANAP is carried over the MAP-E interface instead of BSSAP. Reference to TS 29.108 is provided for further details.
   - When new parameters need to be added for transfer on the E-interface, the principles stated in clause 4.5 of TS 29.010 should be followed.

5. **Conditions for Adding New Parameters on the E-interface**:
   - Parameters should be added to be carried in the AN-APDU when they need to be forwarded to the target radio access network and the encapsulated protocol is the same as the protocol used at the interface between the target MSC and the target radio access network.
   - Parameters should be added to be carried in a MAP message when they need to be forwarded to the target radio access network and the encapsulated protocol is different from the protocol used at the interface between the target MSC and the target radio access network, when they are required by the target MSC but not to be forwarded to the target radio access network, or when they are required by the target MSC for subsequent procedures and cannot be derived from the message encapsulated in the AN-APDU.

These principles ensure seamless interworking and efficient parameter handling during handover and relocation procedures between different protocols in mobile networks.","The answer should cover the general principles of handover and relocation procedures as outlined in TS 23.009. It should explain the interworking between different protocols (TS 48.008, TS 25.413, TS 29.002) for various handover scenarios (UMTS to GSM, GSM to UMTS, intra UMTS).

Describe the performance measurement requirements as outlined in TS 52.402 Annex B.,"The performance measurement requirements in TS 52.402 Annex B are detailed using a specific template. Firstly, the description provides a short explanation of the measurement operation. The collection method specifies the form in which measurement data is obtained, which can be one of the following: Cumulative Counter (CC), GAUGE (dynamic variable), Discrete Event Registration (DER), or Status Inspection (SI). The condition section outlines the GSM condition that causes the measurement data to be updated, or the conditional circumstances leading to the update if a precise GSM condition cannot be given. The measurement attribute name is referenced by the Object Model. The measurement result section describes the expected result value, typically a single integer value. The measurement function name indicates the function for which the measurement is defined. Finally, the switching technology specifies whether the measurement is applicable to Circuit Switched and/or Packet Switched (GPRS) technology, with combined circuit/packet switched events identified for MSC measurement functions.","The answer should cover the following details: a brief explanation of the measurement operation, the form in which measurement data is obtained (CC, GAUGE, DER, SI), the GSM condition causing the measurement update, the measurement attribute name, the expected result value, the measurement function name, and the applicable switching technology (Circuit Switched and/or Packet Switched)."
"Describe the PID value mapping process for PDCP entities, including how PID values are assigned, the handling of invalid PID values, and the specific mapping for RFC 2507 header compression protocol.","The PID value mapping process for PDCP entities involves several key steps and rules. Firstly, PID values are assigned based on the configuration by upper layers, which includes the PDCP PDU type to be used and the header compression protocol. The PID field in the PDCP PDU is utilized to identify different types of header compression protocols and distinguish different packet types within a protocol, such as RFC 2507.

The general rules for PID value mapping are as follows:
- PID values are mapped independently at each PDCP entity.
- PID value '0' indicates 'no compression' and is used in a PDCP PDU containing a PDCP SDU that is unchanged by the sender and should not be decompressed by the receiver.
- PID values are mapped in ascending order, starting from 1, for each configured header compression protocol, following the order of configuration by the upper layer. The first available PID value is assigned to the first packet type of the header compression protocol as defined in its specification. This mapping continues for all specified packet types in the order defined in the relevant subclauses.
- PID values are re-mapped for the PDCP entity after any reconfiguration of the header compression protocols.

For the RFC 2507 header compression protocol, PID values are mapped to packet types in the specific order presented in the relevant table, where 'n' represents the number of PID values already mapped to other protocol packet types.

If a PDCP entity receives a PDCP PDU with a PID value that is not mapped to a valid packet type, the PDCP PDU is discarded. This ensures that only valid and correctly mapped PDUs are processed, maintaining the integrity of the data transmission.","The answer should include:
- The general rules for PID value mapping, including the use of PID value '0' and the ascending order mapping process.
- The specific order of PID value mapping for RFC 2507 header compression protocol.
- The procedure for handling PDCP PDUs with PID values that are not mapped to valid packet types, which involves discarding the PDCP PDU."
What are the key requirements and limits for OTA operating band unwanted emissions as specified in TS 38.176 6.7.4.6.4?,"The key requirements and limits for OTA operating band unwanted emissions as specified in TS 38.176 6.7.4.6.4 include the application of either Category A or Category B limits. The application of these limits is similar to the General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements for IAB type 2-O. Additionally, the limits in clause 6.7.4.5.2.4 may also apply.

The definitions of key parameters are as follows:
- f: The separation between the contiguous transmission bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the contiguous transmission bandwidth edge.
- f_offset: The separation between the contiguous transmission bandwidth edge frequency and the center of the measuring filter.
- f_offsetmax: The offset to the frequency ΔfOBUE outside the downlink operating band, where ΔfOBUE is defined in table 6.7.1-1.

For emissions inside any sub-block gap for a RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub-blocks on each side of the sub-block gap.

How are DRX parameters handled and updated in A/Gb mode and Iu mode according to the specifications?,"In A/Gb mode, the Mobile Station (MS) may use discontinuous reception (DRX) or not, and if using DRX, it must specify other DRX parameters during the attach procedure. These parameters indicate the delay for the network to send a page request or a channel assignment to the MS. The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) sends these parameters in each page request to the Base Station Subsystem (BSS), which uses this information and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) to calculate the correct paging group. DRX usage is independent of the Mobility Management (MM) states IDLE, STANDBY, and READY. However, when a GPRS MS in READY state uses DRX, it must be considered when assigning a packet data channel for downlink transfer. The SGSN indicates the DRX parameters for the MS in all packet transmission requests to the BSS. During the GPRS attach and routing area update procedures, an MS in READY state should not apply DRX. At inter-SGSN change, the DRX parameters are sent from the old SGSN to the new SGSN as part of the MM context information. If the UE wishes to alter its DRX parameters while in A/Gb mode, it must send a Routing Area Update Request message to the SGSN containing the new DRX parameters. If ISR had been activated, the MS must deactivate ISR by setting its TIN to 'P-TMSI' to perform a Tracking Area Update when it next enters E-UTRAN coverage.

In Iu mode, an MS can set the DRX cycle length specific to the Packet Switched (PS) domain. The DRX parameter information must be indicated by the MS during the attach procedure and when changing from A/Gb mode to Iu mode, also in the routing area update procedure. The SGSN sends these parameters in each page request to the Radio Network Controller (RNC) or BSS, which uses this information and the IMSI to calculate the correct paging group. At inter-SGSN change, the DRX parameters are sent from the old SGSN to the new SGSN as part of the MM context information. The UE should not include the DRX parameters in the Routing Area Update message unless they have been altered. There is an exception for pre-Release 99 SGSNs, where the MS must include the DRX Parameter IE in a Routing Area Update Request message sent at RA update from GERAN to UTRAN. If the network receives a DRX parameters IE from the MS in the routing area update request message, the new SGSN uses the information provided by the MS and ignores the same IE received in MM Context from the old SGSN. If the UE wishes to alter its DRX parameters while in Iu mode, it must send a Routing Area Update Request message to the SGSN containing the new DRX parameters. If ISR had been activated, the MS must deactivate ISR by setting its TIN to 'P-TMSI' to perform a Tracking Area Update when it next enters E-UTRAN coverage.","Key details the answer must include:

Describe the process and information flow involved in configuring and notifying changes in a dynamic group for V2X applications as per 3GPP TS 23.286.,"The process of configuring and notifying changes in a dynamic group for V2X applications as per 3GPP TS 23.286 involves several steps and information flows:

1. **Configure Dynamic Group Request**: The initial step involves the V2X application specific server sending a configure dynamic group request to the VAE server. This information flow is detailed in Table 9.12.2.2-1 (Document 1).

2. **Configure Dynamic Group Response**: Following the request, the VAE server responds to the V2X application specific server with a configure dynamic group response. This information flow is described in Table 9.12.2.3-1 (Document 2).

3. **Creation of Dynamic Group**: The dynamic group is created as defined in subclause 9.12.3 (Document 3). This subclause provides the details on how the dynamic group is established.

4. **Notification of Changes in Dynamic Group**: Once the dynamic group is created, the VAE client is responsible for notifying the VAE server about any changes in the group, such as UE (User Equipment) joining or leaving the group. Subsequently, the VAE server notifies the V2X application specific server about these changes. This process is outlined in subclause 9.12.5.1 (Document 4).

5. **Illustration of Notification Procedure**: The procedure for on-network dynamic group notification is illustrated in Figure 9.12.5.2-1. The pre-condition for this procedure is that the V2X application dynamic group must be created as defined in subclause 9.12.3. The steps involved are:
   - The VAE client sends an identity list notification to the VAE server about group member changes.
   - Upon receipt of the notification, the VAE server further notifies the V2X application specific server about the newly joined or left group members (Document 5).

6. **API Operation for Configuring Dynamic Group**: The API operation named Configure_DynamicGroup is used to configure the dynamic group information at the VAE server. The known consumer of this API operation is the V2X application specific server. The inputs for this operation are referenced in subclause 9.12.2.2, and the outputs are referenced in subclause 9.12.2.3.

Describe the performance requirements and testing procedures for multi-user PUCCH ACK detection.,"The performance requirements for multi-user PUCCH ACK detection are determined by two key parameters: the probability of false detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK on the wanted signal. The performance is measured by the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a probability of detection equal to 0.99, with the probability of false detection of the ACK being 0.01 or less. These probabilities are measured on the wanted signal in the presence of three interfering signals.

The testing procedures involve several steps. First, the AWGN generator is adjusted according to the channel bandwidth. Four signals are configured: one wanted signal and three interferers, which are transmitted via separate fading paths using relative power settings. All signals are transmitted on the same PUCCH resources but with different PUCCH channel indices. The characteristics of all signals are configured according to the relevant specifications.

Multipath fading emulators are set up according to ETU70 propagation conditions. The equipment is adjusted to achieve the specified SNR at the BS input during ACK transmissions on the wanted signal. A signal generator sends a test pattern, and statistics are kept on the number of ACKs detected in idle periods and the number of missed ACKs on the wanted PUCCH signal.

The test verifies the receiver’s ability to detect ACK on the wanted signal in the presence of three interfering signals under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR. This test is applicable to all BS, and for BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths, only the tests for the lowest and highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable. The multi-user PUCCH test is performed only for 2 Rx antennas, Normal CP, and ETU70 propagation conditions, with ACK/NACK repetitions disabled for PUCCH transmission.","The answer must include:

Describe the procedure for evaluating the reported RSRQ values in a multi-cell scenario according to 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The procedure for evaluating the reported Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) values in a multi-cell scenario according to 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several steps:

1. **Initial Configuration**: Ensure the User Equipment (UE) is in State 3A-RF as per 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.3. Configure Secondary Cells (SCells) for all downlink physical channels according to Annex C.0 and C.1.

2. **Activation of SCCs**: The Serving System (SS) configures SCells (Cell 2, Cell 3, and Cell 4) on the Secondary Component Carriers (SCCs) as per 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 5.2A.4. The SS activates SCCs by sending the MAC Control Element (MAC-CE) according to 3GPP TS 36.321 clauses 5.13 and 6.1.3.8, and waits for at least 2 seconds as per 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.

3. **Parameter Setting**: Set the parameters according to Table 9.2.56.5-1 as appropriate. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.1.

4. **Transmission of RRC Messages**: The SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1. The UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message and periodically transmits MeasurementReport messages.

5. **Evaluation of MeasurementReport Messages**: After a 10-second wait from the transmission of the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, the SS checks the reported RSRQ values in the periodic MeasurementReport messages. The reported RSRQ values for Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3, and Cell 4 are compared to the actual RSRQ values according to Table 9.2.56.5-2. This comparison determines a pass or fail status for the events ","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - Initial configuration of the UE and SCells.
  - Activation of SCCs and the transmission of RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages.
  - The process for transmitting and evaluating MeasurementReport messages.
  - Criteria for comparing reported RSRQ values to actual values and determining pass/fail status.

Describe the process and requirements for managing and updating LSA information for subscribers in a 3GPP network.,"The process and requirements for managing and updating LSA (Location Service Area) information for subscribers in a 3GPP network involve several key steps and components:

1. **Definition and Management of Allowed LSAs**: The network operator or service provider can define one or more LSAs as allowed for a subscriber. It is possible to establish an order of priority between these LSAs and determine if the subscriber should have preferential access within these LSAs. Additionally, it can be defined whether access outside the allowed LSAs is permitted for the subscriber.

2. **Storage of LSA Information**: Subscriber-specific LSA information is stored and managed in the Home Location Register (HLR). Application-related LSA information is stored in the appropriate service platform, such as the CAMEL Service Environment. It is also necessary for subscriber-specific LSA information to be stored and managed in the SIM card. Subscribers may receive SIM cards with initial LSA data pre-stored.

3. **Updating LSA Information on SIM**: The management of LSA data on the SIM can be performed manually, where the SIM must be returned to the network operator or service provider for updating, or over the air interface. The SIM Application Toolkit (SAT) SIM Data Download procedure, as specified in 3GPP TS 31.111, can be used to download LSA data to the SIM over the air interface. SAT class 1 supports SMS as the bearer for LSA data.

4. **Standardised Commands for Remote File Management**: The 3GPP TS 23.048 specifies standardized SIM toolkit commands for remote file management. These commands are based on the instruction set from 3GPP TS 51.011, allowing operators to use and update SIMs from different vendors. The parameters in the SIM Data Download Message can be a single command or a list of commands, each coded according to the generalized structure defined in 3GPP TS 23.048. Security mechanisms, such as various derivatives of DES, are specified to protect remote file management commands.

5. **Creating and Updating Subscriber Records in HLR**: When a subscriber record is created in the HLR, it includes the list of allowed LSAs, the priority of each LSA, the preferential access indicator of each LSA, and information about access rights outside these LSAs. The network operator can change the LSA information for a subscription at any time without affecting any ongoing calls at the moment of change. The update of SIM with user LSA information is done as depicted in subclause 11.3.

Overall, the management and updating of LSA information for subscribers in a 3GPP network involve careful coordination between the HLR, SIM, and service platforms, utilizing standardized procedures and commands to ensure secure and efficient updates.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Definition and management of allowed LSAs, including priority and preferential access.
  - Storage of LSA information in HLR and SIM, and initial provisioning of SIM cards with LSA data.
  - Methods for updating LSA information on SIM, including manual updates and over-the-air updates using SIM Application Toolkit (SAT).
  - Standardised commands for remote file management and security mechanisms to protect LSA data.
  - Process for creating and updating subscriber records in HLR with LSA details, ensuring no disruption to ongoing calls."

Describe the inter-RAT measurement reporting criteria and quantities that the UE must report to UTRAN according to 3GPP TS 25.331.,"According to 3GPP TS 25.331, the UE must report specific quantities to UTRAN when an inter-RAT measurement event is triggered. For GSM, the UE reports the GSM carrier RSSI. For E-UTRA, the UE reports either RSRP or RSRQ, depending on the measurement quantity specified, or both RSRP and RSRQ if required. The measurement reporting criteria are defined within the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, where UTRAN specifies the events that should trigger the UE to send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message. These events are selected based on the needs of the handover evaluation function or other radio network functions. Measurement quantities for UTRAN are based on the monitored primary common pilot channels (CPICH) in FDD mode and the monitored primary common control channels (PCCPCH) in TDD mode. For other RATs, such as GSM and E-UTRA, the measurement quantities are system-specific. The criteria for considering BCCH ARFCN and BSIC combinations, as well as E-UTRA frequencies, are based on the information received in the IE 'Cells for measurement' or the 'inter-RAT cell info' part of the CELL_INFO LIST, and the EUTRA_FREQUENCY_INFO LIST respectively.","The answer must include the specific quantities that the UE reports for inter-RAT measurements (GSM carrier RSSI, E-UTRA RSRP, RSRQ, or both).

What are the requirements and procedures for issuing a STATUS command during periods of inactivity on the UICC-Terminal interface as specified in 3GPP TS 31.121?,"The requirements and procedures for issuing a STATUS command during periods of inactivity on the UICC-Terminal interface as specified in 3GPP TS 31.121 are as follows:

1. **Definition of Inactivity**: Inactivity on the UICC-Terminal interface is defined as starting at the end of the last communication or the last issued STATUS command.

2. **Issuing STATUS Command**: A STATUS command must be issued within every 30-second period of inactivity. This applies during both a call and an active PDP context.

3. **Response Handling**:
   - If no response data is received to the STATUS command, the call or active PDP context must be terminated as soon as possible, but at least within 5 seconds after the STATUS command has been sent.
   - If the Dedicated File (DF) indicated in response to a STATUS command is not the same as that which was indicated in the previous response or accessed by the previous command, the call or active PDP context must be terminated as soon as possible, but at least within 5 seconds after the response data has been received.

4. **Call Termination Conditions**: The call covers a circuit-switched call and/or an active PDP context. The ME may suspend UICC presence detection based on STATUS commands if it has an active PDP context but has not exchanged any data with the network within a 30-second period of inactivity on the UICC-ME interface. The detection should resume as soon as data is exchanged with the network, sending immediately a new STATUS command.

5. **PDP Context Termination Conditions**: There is a 1:1 mapping between one PDP context and one EPS Bearer. The ME may suspend UICC presence detection based on STATUS commands if it has an active EPS bearer context but has not exchanged any data with the network within a 30-second period of inactivity on the UICC-ME interface.

Describe the role of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) feedback in E-UTRAN and its applications in network management and mobility support.,"Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) feedback plays a crucial role in E-UTRAN by enabling the User Equipment (UE) to measure and report the channel quality of one or a group of resource blocks to the Node B. This feedback is essential for optimizing network performance and is adjustable in terms of sub-frame units, allowing for efficient trade-offs between uplink signaling overhead and link adaptation/scheduling performance. The CQI reporting can be periodic or triggered and is set on a per UE or per UE-group basis.

CQI feedback is utilized at the Node B for several key purposes:
- Time/frequency selective scheduling: By understanding the channel quality, the network can schedule transmissions more effectively, ensuring better utilization of available resources.
- Selection of modulation and coding scheme: The network can choose the most appropriate modulation and coding scheme based on the reported channel quality, enhancing data transmission efficiency.
- Interference management: CQI feedback helps in managing interference by adjusting transmission parameters to minimize the impact of interference from neighboring cells.
- Transmission power control: The network can control the transmission power for physical channels, including physical and L2-control signaling channels, based on the CQI feedback to maintain optimal communication quality.

Additionally, channel quality measurements, including those defined for CQI feedback, can be used for interference coordination and management, further improving network performance.

In terms of mobility support, UEs are required to measure relevant quantities of neighbor cells and the serving cell to facilitate efficient mobility functions. These measurements are crucial for:
- PLMN selection: Ensuring the UE connects to the most suitable Public Land Mobile Network.
- Cell selection and reselection: Helping the UE choose the best cell to connect to and switch between cells as needed.
- Handover decisions: Assisting in the seamless transition of the UE from one cell to another, maintaining service continuity.

Overall, CQI feedback and channel quality measurements are integral to both network management and mobility support in E-UTRAN, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the network.","The answer should include the definition and purpose of CQI feedback, its adjustable reporting granularity, and its applications in scheduling, modulation and coding scheme selection, interference management, and transmission power control.

"Describe the procedure and conditions for the UE to perform a handover from Cell 1 to Cell 2 during the test as specified in TS 36.521, including the measurement report triggered by Event A3 as defined in TS 36.331.","The procedure for the UE to perform a handover from Cell 1 to Cell 2 during the test as specified in TS 36.521 involves several steps and conditions. Initially, the test setup includes one E_UTRA FDD-FDD carrier and two cells: an active cell (Cell 1) and a neighbor cell (Cell 2). The test is divided into three successive time periods: T1, T2, and T3.

During T1, the UE may not have any timing information about Cell 2. The UE is configured in State 3A-RF-CE with the condition CEModeB according to TS 36.508. The parameters for T1 are set according to Table 5.1.16.5-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.1. The SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, and the UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.

When T1 expires, the SS switches the power setting from T1 to T2 as specified in Table 5.1.16.5-1. During T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable, and the UE is expected to detect it and send a MeasurementReport message triggered by Event A3. Event A3 is defined in TS 36.331 clause 5.5.4.4, where the entering condition (A3-1) is satisfied when the measurement result of the neighboring cell (Mn) plus the frequency-specific offset (Ofn) and cell-specific offset (Ocn) is greater than the measurement result of the PCell/PSCell (Mp) plus the frequency-specific offset (Ofp) and cell-specific offset (Ocp) plus the hysteresis parameter (Hys) and offset parameter (Off). The leaving condition (A3-2) is satisfied when the opposite inequality holds.

After the UE reports Event A3, the E-UTRAN sends an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message implying handover to Cell 2. The start of T3 is marked by the last TTI containing this RRC message. The SS then switches the power setting from T2 to T3 as specified in Table 5.1.16.5-1. The UE transmits an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message. If the UE transmits the uplink PRACH channel to Cell 2 within 2595 ms from the beginning of T3, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it is a failure.

After T3 expires, the UE either hands back to Cell 1 or switches off if the handover fails. The UE is then reconfigured to State 3A-RF-CE with CEModeB, and the test is repeated with a new physical cell identity for Cell 2 until the confidence level specified in Annex G clause G.2 is achieved.","Key details the answer must include: The initial setup of the test with one active cell and one neighbor cell, the sequence of time periods T1, T2, and T3, the conditions under which the UE detects Cell 2 and sends a measurement report, the specific RRC messages exchanged during the handover process, the criteria for successful handover, and the definitions and conditions for Event A3 as specified in TS 36.331."
"How is the feature negotiation mechanism for the Namf_Location service defined in 3GPP TS 29.518, and what are the key elements involved in indicating supported features?","The feature negotiation mechanism for the Namf_Location service is defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500. This mechanism is used to negotiate optional features between the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) and the NF (Network Function) Service Consumer. The NF Service Consumer indicates the optional features it supports for the Namf_Location service by including the supportedFeatures attribute in the payload of the HTTP Request Message for specific service operations, such as ProvidePositioningInfo (clause 5.5.2.2), ProvideLocationInfo (clause 5.5.2.4), and CancelLocation (clause 5.5.2.5).

The AMF determines the supported features for these service operations as specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 and includes the supportedFeatures attribute in the payload of the HTTP response for the service operation. The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.571, which specifies common simple data types and the encoding of the supportedFeatures attribute.

The supportedFeatures attribute is represented in hexadecimal format. For example, if only the first feature in the feature list is set to 1, the corresponding supportedFeatures attribute would have a hexadecimal character value of '1', or a string of hexadecimal characters with the value '001'. If there are 32 features defined and only the last feature is set to 1, the supportedFeatures attribute would have a string of hexadecimal characters with the value '80000000'. This encoding ensures that the supported features are accurately communicated between the AMF and the NF Service Consumer.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The feature negotiation mechanism as specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500.
  - The role of the supportedFeatures attribute in HTTP Request and Response Messages for the Namf_Location service operations (ProvidePositioningInfo, ProvideLocationInfo, CancelLocation).

1. **Linearised GMSK Pulse Shaping Filter**:
   - **Impulse Response**: The impulse response of the linearised GMSK pulse is defined in subclause 3.5. This filter is a linearised version of the GMSK modulation, where the main component is derived from a Laurent decomposition of the GMSK modulation.
   - **Application Context**: The time reference t' = 0 marks the start of the active part of the burst, which is also the start of the symbol period of symbol number 0, containing the first tail bit.

2. **Spectrally Wide Pulse Shape (c'(t))**:
   - **Impulse Response**: The spectrally wide pulse shape c'(t) is defined as the continuous time representation of a discrete time pulse shape cn = c'((n-1)Ts), where Ts is the sampling period (T/16). A closed-form expression for c'(t) is not available; instead, it is obtained by low-pass filtering the discrete time function with a pass-band of 400 kHz and a stop-band beginning at 2600 kHz, followed by truncating the duration to the time interval [0, 6T]. An example of a low-pass filter used is a raised cosine filter with the impulse response r(t) = si(2πt•2600 kHz)•cos(2πt•2200 kHz)/(1–(4 t•2200 kHz)²), where si(x)=sin(x)/x.
   - **Application Context**: For the uplink, the pulse shape used when transmitting a burst depends on the 'Pulse format' parameter sent during assignment. For the downlink, the spectrally narrow pulse shape shall be used.

3. **Spectrally Narrow Pulse Shape (c0(t))**:
   - **Impulse Response**: The spectrally narrow pulse shape c0(t) is the linearised GMSK pulse defined in subclause 3.5 for the normal symbol period. It is not scaled to the reduced symbol period, hence its duration in terms of the reduced symbol period is 6T.
   - **Application Context**: Similar to the linearised GMSK pulse, the time reference t' = 0 marks the start of the active part of the burst, which is also the start of the symbol period of symbol number 0, containing the first tail bit.

In summary, 3GPP TS 45.004 specifies different pulse shaping filters for modulating symbols represented by Dirac pulses, each with distinct impulse responses and application contexts for uplink and downlink transmissions.","The answer should include the types of pulse shaping filters used (linearised GMSK, spectrally wide, spectrally narrow), their impulse responses, the method of obtaining continuous time functions for spectrally wide pulse shapes, the time reference for the start of the active part of the burst, and the application contexts for uplink and downlink transmissions."
Describe the physical channel parameters and test models used for transmitter tests in FR2 TDD as specified in TS 38.115.,"The physical channel parameters and test models for transmitter tests in FR2 TDD as specified in TS 38.115 are detailed as follows:

General parameters used by all NR test models include:
- Duration: 2 radio frames for TDD (20 ms)
- Slot numbering: Slots are numbered from 0 to 102µ – 1, where µ is the numerology corresponding to the subcarrier spacing
- NRB: Maximum transmission bandwidth configuration as seen in table 5.3.2-2
- CP type: Normal CP
- Virtual resource blocks: Localized type

For FR2 TDD, repeater test models are derived based on the uplink/downlink configuration using the information element TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon. Common physical channel parameters for all FR2 test models are specified in tables 4.9.2.3-2 and 4.9.2.3-3 for PUSCH.

Specific physical channel parameters for different test models are as follows:

1. RUL-FR2-TM2:
   - Used for tests on uplink OTA repeater EVM of single PRB allocation, OTA frequency stability at lower PSD TX power limit at min power.
   - Specific physical channel parameters for 64QAM are defined in table 4.9.2.3.2-1. For 16QAM and QPSK, the parameters are defined with 64QAM PUSCH PRB replaced with selected modulation order PUSCH PRB according to the corresponding test procedure.

2. RUL-FR2-TM3.1:
   - Used for tests on transmitted signal quality, OTA frequency stability at max power, uplink OTA repeater EVM for modulation at max power.
   - Specific physical channel parameters are defined in table 4.9.2.3.1-1 with all QPSK PUSCH PRBs replaced with selected modulation order PUSCH PRBs according to the corresponding test procedure.

3. RUL-FR2-TM3.1a:
   - Used for tests on transmitted signal quality, OTA frequency stability at max power, uplink OTA repeater EVM for 256QAM modulation at max power.
   - Specific physical channel parameters are defined in table 4.9.2.3.1-1 with all QPSK PUSCH PRBs replaced by 256QAM.

These models ensure that the transmitter tests are conducted under standardized conditions, allowing for consistent and reliable performance evaluation.","The answer should include the general parameters used by all NR test models such as duration, slot numbering, NRB, CP type, and virtual resource blocks. It should detail the configurations of TDD for repeater type 2-O test models and common physical channel parameters for PUSCH. Additionally, it should specify the physical channel parameters for RUL-FR2-TM2, RUL-FR2-TM3.1, and RUL-FR2-TM3.1a, including the types of tests conducted (e.g., EVM, frequency stability, signal quality) and the modulation orders used (64QAM, 16QAM, QPSK, 256QAM)."
Describe the test purpose and conformance requirements for MUSIM assistance information in NR RRC_CONNECTED state as specified in TS 38.523 and TS 38.331.,"The test purpose for MUSIM assistance information in NR RRC_CONNECTED state involves several scenarios to ensure proper UE behavior. These scenarios include: 
1. When the UE is configured to provide MUSIM assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED and timer T346g is not running, the UE should transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message.
2. When the UE is configured to provide MUSIM assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED and timer T346g is running, the UE should not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message.
3. When the UE is configured to provide MUSIM assistance information without leaving RRC_CONNECTED and the current musim-GapPreferenceList differs from the last transmission, the UE should transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message.

The conformance requirements for MUSIM assistance information are detailed in TS 38.331, clause 5.7.4.1, 5.7.4.2, and 5.7.4.3. These requirements specify that the UE must consider itself configured to provide MUSIM assistance information based on the received otherConfig settings. If musim-GapAssistanceConfig is set to setup, the UE should provide MUSIM assistance information for gap preference. If musim-LeaveAssistanceConfig is set to setup, the UE should provide MUSIM assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED.

Pre-test conditions for MUSIM UE include configuring NR Cell 1 and NR Cell 12 according to TS 38.508-1, with NR Cell 1 set as the serving cell. The UE must be a MUSIM UE equipped with two USIMs and perform successful registration for MUSIM.

The test procedure sequence involves specific steps and message contents, such as RRCReconfiguration and UEAssistanceInformation messages, to verify the UE's behavior in different scenarios. Tables in TS 38.523 provide detailed steps and message contents required for the test.","Key details the answer must include:

  - Specific message contents required for RRCReconfiguration and UEAssistanceInformation."
"Describe the definition and usage of antenna ports in 3GPP TS 38.211, including their quasi co-location properties and specific sidelink applications.","An antenna port in 3GPP TS 38.211 is defined such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed. Two antenna ports are considered quasi co-located if the large-scale properties of the channel over which a symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a symbol on the other antenna port is conveyed. These large-scale properties include delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, average delay, and spatial Rx parameters.

For sidelink applications, specific antenna ports are defined:
- Antenna ports starting with 1000 for PSSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PSCCH
- Antenna ports starting with 3000 for CSI-RS
- Antenna ports starting with 4000 for S-SS/PSBCH
- Antenna ports starting with 5000 for PSFCH

The conditions for inferring channels between DM-RS and associated symbols are as follows:
- For DM-RS associated with a PSBCH, the channel over which a PSBCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within an S-SS/PSBCH block transmitted within the same slot and with the same block index.
- For DM-RS associated with a PSSCH, the channel over which a PSSCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same frequency resource as the scheduled PSSCH and in the same slot.
- For DM-RS associated with a PSCCH, the channel over which a PSCCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same frequency resource as the transmitted PSCCH and in the same slot.

An S-SS/PSBCH block consists of OFDM symbols in the time domain, numbered in increasing order within the block. The number of OFDM symbols varies depending on the cyclic prefix length. In the frequency domain, the block consists of 132 contiguous subcarriers. For transmission within an S-SS/PSBCH block, antenna port 4000 is used for S-PSS, S-SSS, PSBCH, and DM-RS for PSBCH, with the same cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing applied to all these signals.","The answer should include the definition of an antenna port and the concept of quasi co-location, detailing the large-scale properties involved. It should list the specific antenna ports used for different sidelink applications and explain the conditions under which channels can be inferred between DM-RS and associated symbols. Additionally, it should describe the structure of an S-SS/PSBCH block in both time and frequency domains, including the use of antenna port 4000 and the cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing."
"Describe the measurements related to failed PDU session modifications as defined in TS 28.552, including the causes and the entities involved.","The measurements related to failed PDU session modifications as defined in TS 28.552 include two specific scenarios: modifications initiated by the User Equipment (UE) and modifications initiated by the Session Management Function (SMF).

For modifications initiated by the UE, the measurement provides the number of failed PDU session modifications responded by the SMF. This measurement is split into subcounters per failure cause. Each transmission of the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response indicating a failed PDU session modification by the SMF to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) triggers the relevant subcounter per failure cause to increment by 1. The causes for these failures are listed in table 6.1.3.3.4.2.2-2 of TS 29.502. The measurement is represented as a single integer value and is identified by SM.PduSessionModUeInitFail.Cause, where the cause of the failure is encoded as defined in TS 29.502. This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic in 5GS and involves the SMFFunction.

For modifications initiated by the SMF, the measurement similarly provides the number of failed PDU session modifications responded by the SMF, split into subcounters per failure cause. Each transmission of the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response indicating a failed PDU session modification by the SMF to the AMF triggers the relevant subcounter per failure cause to increment by 1. The causes for these failures are also listed in table 6.1.3.3.4.2.2-2 of TS 29.502. This measurement is represented as a single integer value and is identified by SM.PduSessionModSmfInitFail.Cause, with the cause of the failure encoded as defined in TS 29.502. This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic in 5GS and involves the SMFFunction.

In summary, both measurements track the number of failed PDU session modifications, categorized by the cause of failure, and involve the SMF responding to these modifications. The causes are encoded according to TS 29.502, and the measurements are applicable to packet switched traffic in 5GS.","The answer should include the definitions of the measurements for failed PDU session modifications initiated by both UE and SMF, the role of SMF in responding to these modifications, the use of subcounters per failure cause, the reference to TS 29.502 for the encoding of causes, the format of the measurement as a single integer value, the specific identifiers for each type of failure (SM.PduSessionModUeInitFail.Cause and SM.PduSessionModSmfInitFail.Cause), the involvement of SMFFunction, and the applicability to packet switched traffic in 5GS."
Describe the services offered by the SBI capable HSS via the Nhss_ims interface and explain the bulk subscription process as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502.,"The SBI capable HSS offers several services via the Nhss_ims interface, including Nhss_imsUEContextManagement Service, Nhss_imsSubscriberDataManagement Service, Nhss_imsUEAuthentication Service, Nhss_gbaSubscriberDataManagement Service, and Nhss_gbaUEAuthentication Service. These services are summarized in Table 5.1-1 of the specification.

The SBI capable HSS can be either stateful, storing information in local memory, or stateless, storing information externally in the UDR. A stateless HSS retrieves required data from the UDR using the Ud interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.335, processes incoming requests, and may update and delete data in the UDR as needed. When data in the UDR is shared among different HSS instances within the same group, identified by the HSS Group ID, bulk subscriptions are not applicable. This means that an NF consumer, such as IMS-AS, subscribes to only one HSS instance within the group.

The bulk subscription process, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502, involves the NEF performing bulk subscriptions with NFs that provide necessary services based on operator configuration and local policies. The NEF subscribes to all NFs that support the required events for any UE, groups of UEs, or specific types of UEs, such as IoT UEs. The NFs store this subscription information and notify the NEF when the corresponding events occur.

The call flow for bulk subscription includes the following steps:
1. NEF registers with the NRF for newly registered NFs and their services.
2. NFs register with the NRF upon instantiation.
3. NRF acknowledges the registration.
4. NRF notifies the NEF of newly registered NFs and their services.
5. NEF evaluates the NFs and subscribes to the corresponding NFs for the required events.
6-7. NFs notify the NEF when event triggers occur, and the NEF may store the information in the UDR.
8. Applications register with the NEF for certain events.
9-10. NFs notify the NEF of event triggers, and the NEF may store the information in the UDR.
11a-b. NEF reads from the UDR and notifies the application of the subscribed events.

This process ensures that the NEF can manage and notify applications of relevant events efficiently, leveraging the capabilities of the UDR and the NRF.","The answer should include the specific services offered by the SBI capable HSS via the Nhss_ims interface, such as UE context management, subscriber data management, and UE authentication. It should explain the difference between stateful and stateless HSS, including how stateless HSS interacts with UDR. The answer should also cover the concept of HSS Group ID and its impact on bulk subscriptions. Additionally, it should detail the bulk subscription process, including the role of NEF, local policies, event notifications, and the call flow for bulk subscription, highlighting the interaction between NEF, NRF, and UDR."
Describe the attributes used in EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' protocols for indicating trust relationships and supported mobility protocols during 3GPP-based access authentication.,"During 3GPP-based access authentication, two key attributes are used in the EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' protocols: AT_TRUST_IND and AT_IPMS_IND.

The AT_TRUST_IND attribute is used to indicate the trust relationship of the non-3GPP access network. When the UE performs 3GPP-based access authentication, the 3GPP AAA server may send this trust relationship indicator to the UE during the EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA', or EAP-3GPP-LimitedService based access authentication. If the non-3GPP access network is trusted, the 3GPP AAA server sends the AT_TRUST_IND attribute as specified in 3GPP TS 29.273. This attribute is included in the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge, EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge, or EAP-Request/3GPP-LimitedService-Init-Info message payload. The detailed coding and structure of the AT_TRUST_IND attribute are described in clause 8.2.3.1 of TS 24.302.

The AT_IPMS_IND attribute is used by the UE to indicate the supported mobility protocols during network access authentication. The UE may provide this indication using the AT_IPMS_IND attribute in the EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' protocols if it receives the AT_RESULT_IND attribute within the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge or EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge message. The UE shall also include the AT_RESULT_IND attribute within the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge or EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge message payload. The AT_IPMS_IND attribute indicates support for one or more mobility protocols, such as DSMIPv6, MIPv4, and NBM (Network-Based Mobility). The detailed coding and structure of the AT_IPMS_IND attribute are described in clause 8.2.1.1 of TS 24.302.

In summary, the AT_TRUST_IND attribute is used by the 3GPP AAA server to indicate the trust relationship of non-3GPP access networks, while the AT_IPMS_IND attribute is used by the UE to indicate supported mobility protocols during network access authentication.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose and usage of the AT_TRUST_IND attribute in EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA', and EAP-3GPP-LimitedService protocols.
  - The conditions under which the AT_TRUST_IND attribute is sent by the 3GPP AAA server.

Describe the process and conditions under which a UE updates its radio access capabilities according to 3GPP TS 25.331 specifications.,"According to 3GPP TS 25.331, the process and conditions under which a User Equipment (UE) updates its radio access capabilities are as follows:

1. **Capability Update Requirement**: If the Information Element (IE) 'Capability Update Requirement' is included, the UE shall update its capabilities based on the specific mode and conditions:
   - **FDD Mode**: If the IE 'UE radio access FDD capability update requirement' is TRUE and the UE supports FDD mode, the UE shall store its UTRA FDD capabilities and common UTRA capabilities in the IE 'UE radio access capability' and 'UE radio access capability extension' in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED. Specific IEs to be stored include 'RF capability FDD extension', 'Measurement capability extension', 'Additional Secondary Cells', and 'Non-contiguous multi-cell' for each supported UTRA FDD frequency band.
   - **3.84 Mcps TDD Mode**: If the IE 'UE radio access 3.84 Mcps TDD capability update requirement' is TRUE and the UE supports 3.84 Mcps TDD mode, the UE shall store its UTRAN-specific 3.84 Mcps TDD capabilities and common UTRAN capabilities in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED.
   - **7.68 Mcps TDD Mode**: If the IE 'UE radio access 7.68 Mcps TDD capability update requirement' is TRUE and the UE supports 7.68 Mcps TDD mode, the UE shall store its UTRAN-specific 7.68 Mcps TDD capabilities and common UTRAN capabilities in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED.
   - **1.28 Mcps TDD Mode**: If the IE 'UE radio access 1.28 Mcps TDD capability update requirement' is TRUE and the UE supports 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, the UE shall store its UTRAN-specific 1.28 Mcps TDD capabilities and common UTRAN capabilities in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED. If the UE supports E-UTRA, it shall also store the IE 'UE radio access capability', including 'Measurement capability TDD' for each supported E-UTRA band.

2. **System Specific Capability Update Requirement**: If the IE 'System specific capability update requirement list' is present, the UE shall:
   - For each Radio Access Technology (RAT) requested in the IE 'UE system specific capability', if the UE supports the listed RAT, it shall include its inter-RAT radio access capabilities in the IE 'UE system specific capability' from the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED.
   - If the listed RAT is GSM and PS Handover to GPRS is supported, include the IE 'MS Radio Access Capability' in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED.
   - If the listed RAT is E-UTRA and the IE 'Requested E-UTRA Frequency Band list' is present and supported by the UE, include all supported E-UTRA bands, non-CA bands, CA band combinations, and other E-UTRA capabilities in the IE 'UE system specific capability' in the variable UE_CAPABILITY_REQUESTED.

3. **Default Values and Actions**: If the IE 'Capability update requirement' is not present, the UE shall assume the default values as specified in subclause 10.3.3.2:
   - 'UE radio capability FDD update requirement' = FALSE
   - 'UE radio capability 3.84 Mcps TDD update requirement' = FALSE
   - 'UE radio capability 7.68 Mcps TDD update requirement' = FALSE
   - 'UE radio capability 1.28 Mcps TDD update requirement' = FALSE

  - Default values and actions when the IE 'Capability update requirement' is not present."
"Describe the process and options for transferring measurement reports in a 3GPP network, including the roles of NE, EM, and NM, and the file formats involved.","In a 3GPP network, the process of transferring measurement reports involves several steps and options, with specific roles for Network Elements (NE), Element Managers (EM), and Network Managers (NM). 

Measurement reports are generated by each measurement job running on an NE at the end of each granularity period. These reports include:
- Identification of the measurement job that generated the report.
- Identification of the involved measurement type(s) and the measured network resource(s) (e.g., NodeB).
- A timestamp referring to the end of the granularity period.
- Result values for each measurement type and an indication of the validity of these values.
- An indication if the scan is not complete and the reason why it could not be completed.

Multiple measurement reports are aggregated into a measurement result file for transfer. The file format for this aggregated file is specified by the Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432.

There are two primary methods for transferring these reports to the EM:
1. Immediate notifications: Reports are automatically forwarded to the EM at the end of the granularity period.
2. Deferred retrieval: Reports are stored locally in the NE and can be retrieved when required.

The transfer of measurement results can be controlled by the system operator and may be implementation-specific. Each implementation must support a file transfer facility to an external OS (such as an NM) using protocols like FTAM ISO 8571, (T)FTP, or FTIRP. This interface can be located either in the NEs or the EM, depending on the vendor's choice.

Measurement results can be forwarded to the NM via a bulk transfer interface, which may reside in the EM or the NEs. The control of this bulk transfer may involve the EM and/or the NM. In networks with multiple OSs, it is necessary to support multiple destinations for data transfer.

Measurement reports may contain fixed information, such as the identification of network resources and a timestamp, in addition to specific measurement results. If requested by the EM/system operator, these reports can be stored locally within the NE. The storage capacity, duration, and deletion method are implementation-dependent.

If some or all requested measurement data cannot be collected, this must be indicated in the measurement report. In extreme cases, no report may be generated, and the destination (EM and/or NM) must be capable of handling missing or incomplete reports.

Overall, the process and options for transferring measurement reports in a 3GPP network are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different implementation scenarios, ensuring that measurement data can be effectively managed and utilized by both EM and NM.","The answer must include:
    - Description of the elements included in measurement reports (identification, type, resource, timestamp, result values, validity, scan completion status)

1. **Primary Level Settings and Test Tolerances**:
   - The UE shall send one Event A6 triggered measurement report with a measurement reporting delay of less than 25602 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
   - The overall delays measured are defined as the time from the beginning of time period T2 to the moment the UE sends one Event A6 triggered measurement report to Cell 3.

"Describe the procedures and actions taken by the MME upon receiving a reset indication from the HSS, including how subscriber records are managed and updated.","Upon receiving a reset indication from the Home Subscriber Server (HSS), the Mobility Management Entity (MME) undertakes several procedures to manage and update subscriber records effectively. 

Firstly, the MME sets the Network Emergency Alert Flag (NEAF) for all registered User Equipment (UEs) in the MME that have a valid SGs association with a Visitor Location Register (VLR). The NEAF is significant as it indicates whether the UE is in an emergency state, which impacts how the MME interacts with the VLR.

When the MME detects any signalling activity from the UE, it reports to the VLR if the NEAF is set for that UE. If the signalling activity leads to a procedure towards the VLR, the MME follows the procedure and resets the NEAF. If the activity does not lead to any procedure towards the VLR, the MME sends an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message to the VLR and resets the NEAF. To avoid high signalling load, the MME may delay sending the activity indication for a maximum operator-configured time period.

"Describe the assistance provided by GNSS parameters in 3GPP TS 36.305 for satellite position and clock corrections, including the specific models and corrections mentioned in the documents.","In 3GPP TS 36.305, GNSS parameters provide crucial assistance for calculating satellite position and clock corrections. The Ephemeris and Clock Models assistance offers the GNSS receiver parameters to determine the GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. Different GNSS systems use various model parameters and formats, all of which are supported by the signalling.

SSR Orbit Corrections provide parameters for orbit corrections in radial, along-track, and cross-track components. These corrections are used to compute a satellite position correction, which is combined with the satellite position calculated from broadcast ephemeris. The orbit corrections define an offset between the broadcast ephemeris orbit and a satellite antenna reference point (ARP). For integrity purposes, SSR Orbit Corrections also include the correlation time for orbit error and orbit error rate, as well as the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Orbit Error and its associated error rate. Additionally, it includes residual risks for the satellite and constellation, which are the aggregate residual risks for the satellite or constellation Signal in Space, excluding atmospheric effects.

SSR Clock Corrections provide parameters to compute the GNSS satellite clock correction applied to the broadcast satellite clock. A polynomial of order 2 describes the clock differences for a certain time period, including clock offset, drift, and drift rate. For integrity purposes, SSR Clock Corrections also include the correlation time for clock error and clock error rate, as well as the mean and standard deviation that bounds the residual Clock Error and its associated error rate.","The answer should include details on how Ephemeris and Clock Models assistance helps in calculating GNSS satellite position and clock offsets, the types of model parameters and formats supported.

Additionally, it should cover SSR Clock Corrections, describing the polynomial used for clock differences, correlation time for clock error, clock error rate, mean and standard deviation of residual Clock Error."
"Describe the key elements and integration levels of a 3GPP Telecom Management Network, including the roles and system contexts of Interface IRPs.","A 3GPP Telecom Management Network consists of various management layers and building blocks, tailored to meet the specific needs of different organizations. The key elements include the roles and system contexts of Interface IRPs, as well as the integration levels required for a comprehensive management solution.

System Contexts A and B are used for managing Network Elements (NEs). The choice between System Context A or B is implementation-dependent, and an IRPAgent must support one of these contexts. The IRPAgent implements and supports one or more IRPs, while the IRPManager uses the IRPAgent. The interaction across the management interface does not reveal whether the Element Manager (EM) and NE are integrated into a single system or operate separately. Entities can play dual roles as consumers and producers for different operations and notifications within the same Interface IRP.

Integration levels in telecom/datacom networks are crucial for building a complete management solution. These levels include:
- Screen Integration: Each application has its own specific Graphical User Interface (GUI) that must be accessible from a unified screen. Seamless integration between various GUIs is required, although Screen Integration is not specified in the document.
- Application Integration: Applications must interwork on a machine-to-machine basis to automate various end-to-end processes for communication providers.

Critical architectural issues and compliance conditions for 3GPP management interfaces are fundamental requirements for any 3GPP entity, whether it is a network element or a management system. These requirements ensure that the management network can handle the complexity and diverse needs of different organizations effectively.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Explanation of System Contexts A and B and their implementation dependency.

"Describe the initial conditions, test procedure, and message contents for the TDD Absolute RSRP Accuracy E-UTRA for Carrier Aggregation test requirement.","The initial conditions for the TDD Absolute RSRP Accuracy E-UTRA for Carrier Aggregation test requirement include the following: The test environment should be set to Normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH as defined in the relevant standards. Frequencies to be tested are specified according to Annex E table E-1 and clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1 for different CA bandwidth classes. The channel bandwidth to be tested is 10 MHz for Cell 1 on the PCC and 5 MHz for Cell 2 on the SCC, as defined for different CA configurations.

The connection setup involves connecting the SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connectors. For UEs supporting only 2Rx in all the bands under test, the setup should follow the appropriate figure group A.41. For UEs supporting 4Rx in any of the bands under test, figure A.90 should be used without a neighbor on Pcell, utilizing the 2Rx module for cells on bands supporting 2Rx and the 4Rx module for cells on bands supporting 4Rx. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0.

The test procedure follows the same steps as in clause 9.1.7.1.4.2 with specific exceptions: Table 9.1.7.1.5-1 is replaced by Table 9.1.19.1.5-1, and Table 9.1.7.1.5-2 is replaced by Table 9.1.19.1.5-2.

"Describe the structure and rules for constructing LPPa protocol messages as defined in TS 36.455, including the tabular format and ASN.1 definitions.","The structure and rules for constructing LPPa protocol messages are detailed in TS 36.455. The messages and information elements required for the LPPa protocol are described in a tabular format in sub clauses 9.1 and 9.2. The attributes used for this tabular description include Presence, Range Criticality, and Assigned Criticality, whose definitions and usage can be found in TS 36.413. The messages have been defined according to the guidelines specified in TR 25.921.

Sub clause 9.3 of TS 36.455 provides the corresponding ASN.1 definition for the LPPa protocol messages. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of LPPa messages, and it takes precedence over the tabular format in case of any contradictions, except for the conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format takes precedence.

When constructing LPPa messages using ASN.1 definitions, the following rules apply:
- Information Elements (IEs) must be ordered in the IE container as they appear in the object set definitions.
- Object set definitions specify the number of times IEs may appear. An IE must appear exactly once if its presence field is marked as 'mandatory'. An IE may appear at most once if its presence field is marked as 'optional' or 'conditional'.
- If a tabular format specifies multiplicity for an IE (i.e., an IE list), the corresponding ASN.1 definition separates this into two parts: an IE container list and list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own and may contain only one kind of list elements.

If an LPPa message is received that does not conform to these construction rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error and will be handled according to the procedures defined for such errors in clause 10 of TS 36.455.","The answer should include the following key details:

Describe the key enhancements and requirements introduced in 5G ProSe relaying and ATSSS in Rel-17 and Rel-18 as specified in the 3GPP documents.,"The 3GPP documents specify several key enhancements and requirements for 5G ProSe relaying and ATSSS in Rel-17 and Rel-18. 

For 5G ProSe relaying, REFEC introduces a number of requirements, including:
- Multipath relays, which have been covered in SA2 within their Rel-18 ProSe study.
- Support for all kinds of data types.
- Indication of the Quality of Service (QoS) that can be provided.
- Service continuity to ensure ongoing communication.
- Permission authorization to manage access rights.
- Relay selection to choose the most appropriate relay.
- Charging mechanisms to handle billing and costs.

For ATSSS in Rel-17, several enhancements have been specified, including:
- Steering mode enhancements, which improve the decision-making process for steering traffic based on access network performance measurements such as RTT and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) over each access of a Multi Access (MA) PDU Session.
- Support for MA PDU Sessions with a 3GPP access over EPC, allowing simultaneous data communication over a 3GPP access connected to EPC and a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC.
- PMF measurements per QoS flow, providing more accurate performance measurements for specific QoS flows rather than default ones.
- Load-balancing without pre-defined split percentages, enabling the UE and UPF to autonomously select their own percentages for each access type to maximize throughput.
- Load-balancing with UE-assistance indication, allowing the UE to decide how to distribute uplink traffic based on its internal state and inform the UPF of its decision.
- Threshold values, which link steering modes with specific conditions such as RTT or PLR thresholds to optimize traffic steering.

These enhancements and requirements aim to improve the efficiency, flexibility, and performance of 5G networks in handling data communication and relaying.","The answer should cover the following details: 
  - The requirements introduced by REFEC for 5G ProSe relaying, including the types of relays covered and the specific aspects such as data type support, QoS indication, service continuity, permission authorization, relay selection, and charging.

"Describe the procedures and actions taken by the CSI AS when initiating and managing sessions towards the CUA and the originating UE, including handling SIP responses and combining SDP answers.","When the CSI AS initiates a session towards the CUA for non-voice media, it operates as an application server performing third-party call control, acting as a routing B2BUA. The CSI AS sets the Request-URI and the To header field to the SIP-URI for the CUA in the outgoing SIP INVITE request. It populates the SDP with the non-voice media parameters included in the SIP INVITE or SIP UPDATE request from the originating UE. The Accept-Contact header field is included with feature tags such as '+g.3gpp.cs-voice' or '+g.3gpp.cs-video', marked as explicit. The SIP INVITE request is then sent towards the S-CSCF for further routing. Upon receiving a SIP response from the CUA, the CSI AS acts according to specific rules.

When initiating a session towards the originating UE, the CSI AS again operates as an application server performing third-party call control, acting as an initiating B2BUA. It sets the Request-URI and the To header field in the outgoing SIP INVITE request to the SIP URI indicated in the P-Asserted-Identity header field received from the originating UE. The SDP is populated with media components included in the SDP of a SIP re-INVITE or UPDATE request that cannot be used on the existing session to the originating UE. The SIP INVITE request is then sent towards the S-CSCF for further routing. The CSI AS handles the SIP response from the originating UE by following specific rules.

When managing sessions, the CSI AS combines SIP responses from the CUA and the MGCF. It acts as a B2BUA with additional procedures. If SDP answers are received from both call legs, the CSI AS includes the SDP from both legs in a SIP response to the originating UE. The SIP response code depends on the SIP responses received from the two call legs. If only one SDP answer is received, the CSI AS includes it in the SIP response accordingly. If SIP responses are received without any SDP, the response code is determined based on the received responses.

In cases where a SIP error response is received from one leg, the CSI AS provides the SIP response to the originating UE with the port of the corresponding media set to 0 in the SDP answer. The CSI AS provides combined SIP responses under specific conditions, such as when final SIP responses from both legs have the same status code or when SIP 180 (Ringing) responses arrive from each early dialog of the two call legs. The CSI AS includes '100rel' in the Require header field if at least one SIP response from either call leg includes it.

If multiple SIP responses are received due to forking, the CSI AS chooses one from the CUA and initiates SIP CANCEL requests to cancel the other forked dialogs. If one call leg is established earlier, the CSI AS includes the media description showing the media on the established call leg is ready when responding to the originating UE. If no response is received from one call leg within a specified time, the CSI AS rejects the media of that leg by indicating such rejection in the SDP body media descriptions and may initiate a SIP CANCEL request to cancel the pending session of the corresponding call leg. Responses received after this timeout are ignored.","The answer must include:
  - Detailed steps taken by CSI AS when initiating sessions towards CUA and originating UE.
  - Explanation of CSI AS acting as B2BUA and its role in routing and initiating sessions.

"Describe the process and conditions under which an NF service consumer sends a PUT request to the UDM to create a Parameter Provisioning Data entry for an AF, including the possible responses from the UDM.","The process begins with the NF service consumer, such as the NEF, sending a PUT request to the UDM to create a Parameter Provisioning Data entry for a specific AF identified by the afInstanceId. The request is directed towards the resource URI formatted as .../{ueId}/pp-data-store/{afInstanceId}, where ueId and afInstanceId take values specified in Table 6.5.3.4.2-1. The request body must contain a PpDataEntry object representing the new resource's value.

Upon receiving the request, the UDM performs authorization checks to determine if the AF is permitted to execute this operation for the UE. If the request includes MTC Provider information, the UDM also verifies whether the MTC Provider is authorized to perform the operation; if not, this check is skipped.

The UDM can respond in several ways:
1. If the operation is authorized, the UDM responds with a '201 Created' status, and the response body includes a PpDataEntry object representing the newly created resource.
2. If the AF or MTC Provider is not authorized, the UDM returns a '403 Forbidden' status, along with additional error information in the response body within the 'ProblemDetails' element.

Additionally, if the creation involves parameters like maximum latency, maximum response time, or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count, the UDM may need to adjust related values such as active time, periodic registration timer, or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The UDM will notify the AMF and/or SMF if these values are updated.

In case of failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned, along with relevant error information in the PUT response body as specified in table 6.5.3.4.3.1-3.

"Describe the behavior and requirements of the UE when the dataInactivityTimer is configured and running in the NR RRC_CONNECTED state, including the actions taken upon expiry of the timer.","When the UE is in the NR RRC_CONNECTED state and the dataInactivityTimer is configured and running, the UE monitors data inactivity based on the configuration provided by the RRC. The dataInactivityTimer is started or restarted under the following conditions: if any MAC entity receives a MAC SDU for DTCH, DCCH, CCCH, or multicast MTCH logical channels, or if any MAC entity transmits a MAC SDU for DTCH or DCCH logical channels. 

Upon expiry of the dataInactivityTimer, the UE indicates the expiry to the upper layers. Subsequently, the UE performs actions to transition to the RRC_IDLE state with the release cause 'RRC connection failure'. This transition is specified in the conformance requirements and validated through test procedures that ensure the UE restarts the dataInactivityTimer upon receiving or transmitting MAC SDUs and enters the RRC_IDLE state upon detecting data inactivity when the timer expires.

The conformance requirements and test procedures are detailed in the relevant documents, which outline the pre-test conditions, test procedure sequence, and specific message contents necessary to validate the UE's behavior with the dataInactivityTimer configured and running.","The answer should include the following key details:

"Describe the modulation techniques and procedures for data symbols in 3GPP TS 25.223, including QPSK and 16QAM, and how these are applied in different burst types and HARQ acknowledgement indicator sequences.","In 3GPP TS 25.223, two primary modulation techniques are described for data symbols: QPSK and 16QAM. 

For QPSK modulation, as outlined in Document 1, the data modulation is performed on bits from the output of the physical channel mapping procedure. Two consecutive binary bits are combined to form a complex valued data symbol. Each user burst contains two data blocks, one transmitted before the midamble and one after. The number of symbols per data field is linked to the spreading factor. The QPSK modulation maps the interleaved and encoded data bits to complex symbols.

In the case of 16QAM modulation, described in Document 2, four consecutive binary bits are represented by one complex valued data symbol. Similar to QPSK, each user burst has two data blocks, one before and one after the midamble. The number of symbols per data field is also linked to the spreading factor. The 16QAM modulation maps the interleaved and encoded data bits to complex symbols.

Document 3 explains modifications for burst type 3, where the number of symbols in the second data block is decreased for different TDD rates (3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps).

For HARQ acknowledgement indicator sequences, as detailed in Documents 4 and 5, QPSK modulation is used. Multiple HARQ acknowledgement indicator signature sequences may be mapped onto the same channelisation code. Each QPSK-modulated stream is amplitude-weighted according to the desired signature sequence power, and a summation is performed across all signature sequences mapped to the same channelisation code. The output sequence is then subject to spreading at specific spreading factors for different Mcps rates.

Document 6 covers the generation and application of scrambling codes for MBSFN IMB operation. Only primary scrambling codes are used, and a specific subset of these codes is supported. The primary scrambling code for all physical channels is aligned with the start of the Primary CCPCH frame, ensuring synchronization across the network.

Overall, the modulation techniques and procedures in 3GPP TS 25.223 ensure efficient data transmission and accurate HARQ acknowledgements, with specific adaptations for different burst types and network configurations.","The answer should cover the modulation techniques (QPSK and 16QAM) and their mapping procedures, including the number of bits represented by each complex symbol. It should explain the structure of data blocks in user bursts, modifications for burst type 3, and the handling of HARQ acknowledgement indicator sequences with QPSK modulation and amplitude weighting. Additionally, it should describe the generation and application of scrambling codes for MBSFN IMB operation, including the alignment with CCPCH frames and the subset of supported codes."
"Describe the process and requirements for IRI interception at the Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway, including the roles of different components and reference points.","The process and requirements for IRI interception at the Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway involve several components and reference points. 

For the Serving Gateway:
- The Serving Gateway-C is responsible for delivering the IRI over the X2 reference point to DF2, as defined in clauses 12.2.3 and 12.4.3.
- When IRI events need to be generated from user plane packets, the Serving Gateway-C provides the necessary information to the Serving Gateway-U, similar to the process for CC interception as per clause 12.9.3.1.
- There are two methods for generating IRI events that require access to user plane packets:
  1. The Serving Gateway-C informs the SX3LIF to generate the IRI events, and SX3LIF delivers these events to DF2.
  2. DF3 generates the IRI events based on user plane packets and delivers them to DF2. In this approach, SX3LIF does not need to support the X2 reference point.

For the PDN Gateway:
- The PDN Gateway-C is responsible for delivering the IRI over the X2 reference point to DF2, as defined in clauses 12.2.3, 12.3.3, 12.4.3, and 12.5.3.
- When IRI events need to be generated from user plane packets, the PDN Gateway-C provides the necessary information to the PDN Gateway-U, similar to the process for CC interception as per clause 12.9.3.2.
- There are two methods for generating IRI events that require access to user plane packets:

Describe the procedures and requirements for UE initiating MO-LR in different modes and states as specified in TS 37.571.,"The procedures and requirements for UE initiating Mobile Originating Location Request (MO-LR) in different modes and states are detailed in TS 37.571. When the UE is in E-UTRA RRC_IDLE state and has received an ATTACH ACCEPT message indicating that location services via EPC are not supported but location services via the CS domain are supported, the UE initiates the MO-LR procedure by transmitting an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message.

The conformance requirements for this procedure are specified in TS 23.272, clause 8.3.1. The MO-LR procedure in the CS fallback in EPS is performed as outlined in TS 23.271. When the MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, the UE checks the LCS Support Indication provided by the Attach and TAU procedures as specified in TS 23.401. If the LCS Support Indication indicates that EPC-MO-LR is supported and the UE supports EPC-MO-LR, the UE stays in LTE and initiates the EPC-MO-LR procedure. If EPC-MO-LR is not supported by either the network or the UE, and if the LCS Support Indication indicates CS-MO-LR is supported and the UE supports CS-MO-LR, the UE assumes CS-MO-LR is provided.

Describe the behavior of a UE in idle and connected modes when handling PLMN identities and lists as specified in TS 25.331.,"In TS 25.331, the behavior of a User Equipment (UE) in idle and connected modes when handling Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) identities and lists is detailed extensively. 

For a UE in idle mode:
- The UE must obtain knowledge of the PLMN identity of neighbor cells for cell reselection if System Information Block (SIB) type 18 is present.
- The UE should store all relevant Information Elements (IEs) included in the SIB.
- If SIB type 11ter is scheduled on the Broadcast Control Channel (BCH) and the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11ter' is present, any PLMN list of a given type included in this IE is paired with the list of cells of the same type derived from SIB type 11ter.
- If SIB type 11bis is scheduled on BCH and the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis' is present, any PLMN list of a given type included in this IE is paired with the list of cells of the same type derived from SIB type 11 and SIB type 11bis.
- If neither SIB type 11ter nor SIB type 11bis is scheduled, any PLMN list of a given type included in the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities' is paired with the list of cells of the same type derived from SIB type 11 and SIB type 11bis.
- The PLMN identity located at a given rank in the PLMN list corresponds to the cell with the same ranking in the paired list of cells.
- If no identity is indicated for the first PLMN in a list, the UE assumes the neighboring cell broadcasts the same PLMN configuration as the current cell.
- If no identity is indicated for another entry in the list, the UE assumes the neighboring cell broadcasts the same PLMN configuration as the previous cell in the list.
- If the number of identities in a PLMN list exceeds the number of neighbor cells in the paired list, the extra PLMN identities are ignored.
- If the number of identities in a PLMN list is lower than the number of neighbor cells in the paired list, the missing PLMN identities are replaced by the PLMN configuration for the last cell in the list.

For a UE in connected mode:
- The UE acts similarly to a UE in idle mode with some modifications.
- If SIB type 11ter is scheduled on BCH, the PLMN lists to be considered are those included in the IE 'Connected mode PLMN identities for SIB 11ter'. If missing, the corresponding list in the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11ter' is used.
- If SIB type 11bis is scheduled on BCH, the PLMN lists to be considered are those included in the IE 'Connected mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis'. If missing, the corresponding list in the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis' is used. If still missing, the corresponding list in the IE 'Connected mode PLMN identities' is used. If still missing, the corresponding list in the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities' is used.
- If neither SIB type 11ter nor SIB type 11bis is scheduled, the PLMN lists to be considered are those included in the IE 'Connected mode PLMN identities'. If missing, the corresponding list in the IE 'Idle mode PLMN identities' is used.
- The paired lists of cells are derived from SIB types 11, 11bis, 11ter, and 12 if present.

Additionally, depending on the UE configuration, the UE operates in either 'ANSI-41 mode' or 'GSM-MAP mode', which influences its behavior in handling PLMN identities and lists.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how a UE in idle mode pairs PLMN lists with cell lists based on different System Information Block types.

   - The user must be involved in a private call with an LMR user via the IWF, with or without floor control, established in either manual or automatic commencement mode.

2. **Client-initiated release**:
   - The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call end request to the MCPTT server via the SIP core to tear down the private call.
   - The MCPTT server forwards the corresponding IWF call end request to the IWF, addressed to the MCPTT client ID specified in the original request.
   - The IWF acknowledges the request with an IWF call end response sent to the MCPTT server.
   - The MCPTT server then acknowledges the MCPTT client's request.
   - Both the MCPTT client and the IWF release all media plane resources used for the private call, including floor control resources if applicable.

3. **Server-initiated termination**:
   - The MCPTT server decides to terminate the call based on conditions such as expiry of the maximum duration for MCPTT private calls or timeout due to inactivity.
   - The server sends an MCPTT private call end request to the MCPTT client via the SIP core and a corresponding IWF call end request to the IWF.
   - The MCPTT user is notified about the termination.
   - Both the MCPTT client and the IWF acknowledge the request.
   - The MCPTT client and the IWF release all media plane resources used for the private call, including floor control resources if applicable.

4. **IWF-initiated release**:
   - The LMR system requests to release the ongoing interworked private call.
   - The IWF sends an IWF call end request to the MCPTT server to tear down the private call.
   - The MCPTT server forwards the corresponding MCPTT private call end request to the MCPTT client.
   - The MCPTT user is notified about the release.
   - The MCPTT client acknowledges the request.
   - The MCPTT server then acknowledges the IWF's request.
   - Both the MCPTT client and the IWF release all media plane resources used for the private call, including floor control resources if applicable.

These procedures ensure that the release of an ongoing MCPTT private call is handled efficiently, whether initiated by the client, server, or IWF.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the different architectures for applying TCAPsec in SS7 networks, including the conditions under which each architecture is used.","TCAPsec can be applied in SS7 networks using two main architectures: end-to-end and hub-and-spoke. 

In the end-to-end architecture, TCAPsec is applied between two PLMNs that do not wish to trust intermediate SS7 networks. This architecture ensures that all TCAP user signaling messages entering or leaving the PLMN transit through an SS7 Security Gateway (SS7-SEG) that belongs to the PLMN. The SS7-SEG performs protection of outgoing messages and checks, de-protects, or blocks incoming messages. It also handles Global Title Translation. The SS7-SEG is typically located at the border of the PLMN, ensuring that incoming messages transit through it before reaching any other node within the PLMN, and outgoing messages transit through it immediately before reaching a node outside the PLMN. This setup is illustrated in Figure 4.2-1 of the specification.

The hub-and-spoke architecture is required when certain payload-related services are performed by an intermediate SS7 carrier trusted by the PLMN. This architecture is necessary in cases where the intermediate SS7 carrier has to perform TCAP user payload modification, such as steering of roaming or inserting a virtual SMSC address in the MAP message. It is also required when the intermediate SS7 carrier needs to perform protocol interworking, such as inter-standard SMS for roaming into CDMA or a CAMEL Gateway. Additionally, the hub-and-spoke architecture may be used when the intermediate SS7 carrier performs message screening (e.g., SPAM control) or advanced reporting. 

The choice between end-to-end and hub-and-spoke architectures depends on the agreed protection mode and the willingness of the communicating PLMNs to share the confidentiality key with the SS7 carrier. If protection mode 1 is agreed upon, the end-to-end architecture is preferred from a security point of view. If protection mode 2 is agreed upon and both PLMNs find it acceptable to share the confidentiality key with the SS7 carrier, the end-to-end architecture can be used and is preferred. However, if confidentiality key sharing is not acceptable, the hub-and-spoke architecture is the only possible solution. Figure 4.2-2 provides an example of the hub-and-spoke architecture.

In summary, the end-to-end architecture is used when direct trust between PLMNs is required, while the hub-and-spoke architecture is used when intermediate SS7 carriers perform specific services or when confidentiality key sharing is not feasible.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of the end-to-end architecture and hub-and-spoke architecture for TCAPsec in SS7 networks. It should cover the types of SS7 networks where TCAPsec can be applied, the role of SS7-SEGs in message protection, and the specific conditions and examples that necessitate the use of hub-and-spoke architecture. Additionally, it should address the considerations for choosing between the two architectures based on security preferences and operational requirements."
What are the key simulation parameters and performance results for MS RX diversity under different test scenarios as defined in 3GPP TS 45.912?,"The key simulation parameters and performance results for MS RX diversity under different test scenarios as defined in 3GPP TS 45.912 include the following details:

- **Simulation Parameters**: The simulations consider antenna gain imbalance and correlation, with three parameter sets (PS 1, PS 2, PS 3):
  - **PS 1**: Uncorrelated signals/antennas with equal average receive power.
  - **PS 2**: Highly correlated signals/antennas with equal average receive power, often due to factors like angle of arrival or small antenna spacing.
  - **PS 3**: Highly correlated signals/antennas with unequal average receive power, which can occur due to shadowing of one antenna by hand or head.

- **Test Scenarios**: The performance is evaluated under two main test scenarios, DTS-1 and DTS-2, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005:
  - **DTS-1**: A single synchronous co-channel interferer.
  - **DTS-2**: Multiple synchronous co- and adjacent channel interferers.

- **Modulation Schemes**: The simulations use two types of modulation schemes:
  - **GMSK**: Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying for both the wanted signal and interferers.
  - **8PSK**: 8 Phase Shift Keying for both the wanted signal and interferers.

- **Performance Metrics**: The performance is measured using the carrier-to-dominant co-channel interference ratio (C/I1) and block error ratios (BLER) for different modulation and coding schemes (MCS):
  - The C/I1 ratio is given in dB for which a block error ratio of 10% and 30% is achieved for MCS-1 to MCS-9 and MCS-8/MCS-9, respectively.

- **Reference Limits**: For benchmarking MS RX diversity performance, the following reference limits from 3GPP TS 45.005 are used:
  - DARP-phase 1 limits for GMSK modulated signals (Table 2o).
  - Co-channel interference performance limits for GMSK (Table 2a) and 8PSK (Table 2c) modulated signals.

- **Performance Results**: The results are provided for packet switched channels and include:
  - Performance under interference-limited scenarios for different modulation schemes.
  - Diversity receiver performance for both DTS-1 and DTS-2 scenarios, with specific results for different correlation values (e.g., 0.0 and 0.7).

Describe the requirements for UE initial transmission timing error and adjustments in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The requirements for UE initial transmission timing error and adjustments in 3GPP TS 36.521 are detailed as follows:

1. **UE Initial Transmission Timing Error Limit (Te)**: The UE initial transmission timing error must be less than or equal to Te, where Te is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24.2 and shown in Table 7.1.11.3-1. This requirement applies to the first transmission in a DRX, eDRX_CONN cycle, or the first transmission in a repetition period (R>1) for PUCCH, PUSCH, and SRS, or the PRACH transmission.

2. **Conditions for Initial Transmission**: The initial transmission timing error requirements apply under specific conditions, such as the first transmission in a DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, or during a repetition period (R>1) for certain channels. When it is not the first transmission in these cycles, or when no repetitions are configured, the UE must adjust its transmission timing according to the received downlink frame of the reference cell, except when the timing advance in clause 7.3 is applied.

3. **Reference Point for UE Initial Transmit Timing Control**: The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control requirement is the downlink timing of the reference cell. The downlink timing is defined as the time when the first detected path of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference cell. For PRACH, NTA_Ref is defined as 0, and for other channels, it is the difference between UE transmission timing and the downlink timing immediately after the last timing advance was applied.

4. **Rules for Adjusting Transmission Timing**: When no repetition period is configured, or the repetition period is R=1, the UE must follow specific rules for adjusting its uplink timing:
   - The maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment is Tq seconds.
   - The minimum aggregate adjustment rate is 7 * TS per second.
   - The maximum aggregate adjustment rate is Tq per 200 ms.
   The maximum autonomous time adjustment step Tq is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24.2 and shown in Table 7.1.11.3-2.

5. **Normative References**: The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24 and A.7.1.11.

6. **Impact of UE Frequency Error and Time Adjustment Quantization**: Both the allowed UE frequency error and the UE time adjustment quantization can affect the test results. Therefore, these factors are taken into account when setting the test tolerances and requirements.

These requirements ensure that the UE maintains accurate transmission timing, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the network and minimizing interference.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the process and requirements for logging service API invocations at the CAPIF core function, including the structure of resource URIs, supported query parameters, request and response data structures, and response codes.","To log service API invocations at the CAPIF core function, the API exposing function must send an HTTP POST message to the CAPIF core function. The body of this HTTP POST message should include the identity information of the API exposing function and the API invocation log information as specified. Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the CAPIF core function will verify the identity of the API exposing function and check if it is authorized to create service API invocation logs. If authorized, the CAPIF core function will process the API invocation log information, store it in the API repository, create a new resource, and return the CAPIF Resource Identifier in the response message.

Describe the procedures and requirements for the MSGin5G message segment recovery and confirmation as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.538 document.,"The 3GPP TS 24.538 document outlines specific procedures and requirements for MSGin5G message segment recovery and confirmation. 

For segment recovery, if the Message Receiver does not receive all segments within the expected time, it must send a CoAP POST request to the Message Sender to recover the missing segments. The CoAP POST request must:
- Set the 'T' field in the CoAP header to 0, indicating a Confirmable request.
- Include the Message Sender's address in a CoAP Option, such as a Uri-Path Option if the address is a URI.
- Set the CoAP Content-Format to '50', which corresponds to application/json.
- Include specific information elements in the JSON payload:

  2. 'Message Type' with the value 'SEGREC' to indicate segment recovery.
  3. 'Segmentation Set Identifier' copied from one of the previously received segments.
  4. 'List of Segment range' indicating the range of missing segments, each consisting of start and end sequence numbers (e.g., 5-7, 10-10, 15-19).

The JSON Schema for segment recovery is defined in clause 7.3.6.2 and includes properties such as 'msgIden' (service identifier), 'msgType' (message type 'SEGREC'), 'segId' (segmentation set identifier), and 'segNoList' (list of segment ranges). All these fields are required.

For message segments received confirmation, if the Message Receiver successfully receives all segments or determines that the recovery has failed, it sends a CoAP POST request to the Message Sender. This request must:
- Set the 'T' field in the CoAP header to 0, indicating a Confirmable request.
- Include the Message Sender's address in a CoAP Option, such as a Uri-Path Option if the address is a URI.
- Set the CoAP Content-Format to '50', which corresponds to application/json.

"Describe the Match Report procedures for Model B restricted discovery in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios, including the interactions between the ProSe Function and the OCS.","The Match Report procedures for Model B restricted discovery involve several steps and interactions between the Discoverer UE, ProSe Function, and the Online Charging System (OCS). These procedures differ slightly between non-roaming and roaming scenarios and also vary based on the mode (IEC or ECUR).

For non-roaming scenarios, the procedure is as follows:
1. When the Discoverer UE receives a ProSe Response Code that matches the Discovery Response Filter, it sends a Match Report message to the ProSe Function in the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN).
2. The ProSe Function in HPLMN responds with a Match Report Acknowledgement.
3. The ProSe Function sends a Charging Data Request to the Charging Data Function (CDF) in HPLMN, which generates the PF-DD-CDR for the Discoverer UE.
4. The CDF returns a Charging Data Response to the ProSe Function.
5. Optionally, the ProSe Function may send a Match Report Info to the ProSe Function of the Discoveree UE.

"What are the dynamic range requirements for the receiver in various 3GPP specifications, and how do they differ across different documents and scenarios?","The dynamic range requirements for the receiver in various 3GPP specifications are defined to ensure the receiver can handle a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal within the received channel bandwidth, with a throughput requirement for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) signal, as specified in TS 36.104, subclause 7.3.

For the access link, the receiver dynamic range requirements are specified in TS 36.104, subclause 7.3, and only the requirements in table 7.3.1-2 for local area apply, as stated in TS 36.116, subclause 7.3.2.

The test requirements for the relay access link receiver dynamic range are the same as those in TS 36.141, clause 7.3, but they apply to relay nodes. The minimum requirements are defined in TS 36.116, clause 7.3.2, and only the requirements of Table 7.3.2 for local area of TS 36.141 apply, as mentioned in TS 36.117, subclause 7.3.2.

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in TS 36.104, subclause 7.3, as indicated in TS 37.104, subclause 7.3.1.

For NB-IoT standalone operation, E-UTRA in-band or guard band operation, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is also specified in TS 36.104, subclause 7.3. However, for NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in TS 38.104, subclause 7.3.2, as detailed in TS 37.104, subclause 7.3.5.

In summary, while the fundamental definition and measurement conditions for dynamic range are consistent across these specifications, the specific requirements and applicable tables or clauses vary depending on the type of link (access or relay), the operational scenario (local area, E-UTRA, NB-IoT), and the specific 3GPP document referenced.","The answer should cover the definition of dynamic range as per TS 36.104, including the conditions under which it is measured (presence of AWGN signal and throughput requirement).

The criticality information is defined in subclause 10.3.2 and specifies actions based on three possible values: Reject IE, Ignore IE and Notify Sender, and Ignore IE.

1. **Reject IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE', the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the initiating message lacks sufficient information to determine values for all required IEs, the procedure is terminated, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages missing IEs/IE groups with 'Reject IE' criticality, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.

2. **Ignore IE and Notify Sender**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing IEs/IE groups with 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender' criticality, the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The missing IEs are reported in the response message. If the initiating message lacks sufficient information, the procedure is terminated, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated. For response messages, the missing IEs are ignored, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated to report the missing IEs.

3. **Ignore IE**: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing IEs/IE groups with 'Ignore IE' criticality, the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The same applies to response messages.

The rules for comprehension of IEs/IE groups and EPs are as follows:
- When a new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity, although some may remain unsupported.
- The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any unsupported EP may be considered not comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.

For missing IEs/IE groups, the receiving node shall treat them according to the criticality information specified in the received message. When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with 'Reject IE' or 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender' criticality, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.

"How does the EES handle an HTTP POST request for UE location information from the EAS, including authorization, processing, error handling, and redirection?","When the Edge Application Server (EAS) needs to obtain a User Equipment (UE)'s location information from the Edge Enabler Server (EES), it sends an HTTP POST request to the EES at the URI '{apiRoot}/eees-uelocation/<apiVersion>/fetch'. This request must include the identifier of the UE and the accuracy of the requested location in terms of granularity and location Quality of Service (QoS).

Upon receiving the HTTP POST request, the EES follows these steps:
1. It processes the UE location information request from the EAS.
2. It verifies the identity of the EAS and checks if the EAS is authorized to obtain the UE's location information.
3. If the EAS is authorized, the EES:
   a. Considers the location granularity information provided in the request to obtain the UE's location information.
   b. Checks if valid locally cached UE location information is available. If available, the EES returns the UE location information in the requested format along with the location accuracy and its timestamp.
   c. If valid UE location information is not available in the local cache, the EES obtains the UE location information by utilizing 3GPP core network capabilities. The EES then returns the UE location information to the EAS in the requested format along with the location accuracy and its timestamp as a 200 OK response.

In case of failure, the EES performs proper error handling actions and responds to the EAS with an appropriate error status code.

If the EES determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, it may respond with an HTTP '307 Temporary Redirect' or '308 Permanent Redirect' status code.

   - If needed, EM may configure the attributes of the created MOI(s) and send attributeValueChange notifications to NM if NM has subscribed to these notifications.

2. **Handling VNF Termination**:
   - When the VNF termination operation is completed, VNFM sends a Notify message to EM, carrying the VnfLifecycleChangeNotification to indicate the result of VNF termination.
   - EM detects the termination by checking the attributes status and operation, and decides to modify the MO attribute to remove the association with the terminated VNF instance identified by vnfInstanceId.
   - EM sends a notifyAttributeValueChange message to NM to indicate the MO attribute value has been changed.

3. **Synchronization of VNF Instance Information**:
   - VNFM notifies EM with either VnfLifecycleChangeNotification or VnfInfoAttributeValueChangeNotification.
   - EM sends a QueryVnfRequest to VNFM with filter and attributeSelector to query the VNF instance information.
   - VNFM responds with QueryVnfResponse to EM, providing the vnfInfo.
   - If the attribute values on EM do not match those of the current VnfInfo, EM updates these values.
   - IPRAgent notifies IPRManager about the attribute value changes.

These procedures ensure that the lifecycle management of VNF instances is effectively handled, with proper creation, termination, and synchronization of VNF instance information across the involved components.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The steps involved in creating an MO after VNF instantiation, including the notifications and attributes involved.
  - The steps involved in handling VNF termination, including the detection of termination and the modification of MO attributes.
  - The steps involved in synchronizing VNF instance information, including the notifications, queries, and updates performed by VNFM, EM, and IPRAgent."
Explain the conditions and parameters that a UE must consider for the transmission and mapping of downlink PRS resources as per 3GPP TS 38.211 specifications.,"The transmission and mapping of downlink Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) resources by a User Equipment (UE) are governed by several conditions and parameters as specified in 3GPP TS 38.211.

Firstly, for each downlink PRS resource configured, the UE must map the sequence to resource elements within the resource blocks occupied by the downlink PRS resource. This mapping is subject to the following conditions:
- The resource element must be within the resource blocks occupied by the downlink PRS resource.
- The symbol must not be used by any SS/PBCH block from the serving cell or any non-serving cell whose time-frequency location is provided to the UE by higher layers.
- The slot number must satisfy specific conditions outlined in clause 7.4.1.7.4.

Several parameters influence this mapping:
- The first symbol of the downlink PRS within a slot is determined by the higher-layer parameter dl-PRS-ResourceSymbolOffset.
- The size of the downlink PRS resource in the time domain is given by the higher-layer parameter dl-PRS-NumSymbols.
- The comb size is specified by the higher-layer parameter dl-PRS-CombSizeN-AndReOffset for RTT-based propagation delay compensation, or by dl-PRS-CombSizeN otherwise. The combination of these parameters must be one of the predefined sets such as {2, 2}, {4, 2}, {6, 2}, etc.
- The resource-element offset is obtained from the higher-layer parameter dl-PRS-CombSizeN-AndReOffset.
- The frequency offset is given by Table 7.4.1.7.3-1.

For RTT-based propagation delay compensation, the reference point for mapping is subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0. Otherwise, the reference point is the location of point A of the positioning frequency layer, defined by the higher-layer parameter dl-PRS-PointA.

Regarding the transmission of downlink PRS resources, the UE must assume the downlink PRS resource is being transmitted when the slot and frame numbers fulfill certain conditions. These conditions include:
- The higher-layer parameters dl-PRS-MutingOption1 and dl-PRS-MutingOption2 are not provided.
- If dl-PRS-MutingOption1 is provided with a bitmap but dl-PRS-MutingOption2 is not, and a specific bit is set.
- If dl-PRS-MutingOption2 is provided with a bitmap but dl-PRS-MutingOption1 is not, and a specific bit is set.
- If both dl-PRS-MutingOption1 and dl-PRS-MutingOption2 are provided, and both specific bits are set.

Additional parameters affecting transmission include:
- The periodicity and slot offset given by dl-PRS-Periodicity-and-ResourceSetSlotOffset.
- The downlink PRS resource slot offset given by dl-PRS-ResourceSlotOffset.
- The repetition factor given by dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor.
- The muting repetition factor given by dl-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor.
- The time gap given by dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap.

For RTT-based propagation delay compensation, the UE must follow the transmission conditions described in clause 9 of TS 38.214. Otherwise, the conditions described in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 apply.","The answer must include:
  - Detailed explanation of the conditions under which resource elements are mapped within resource blocks for downlink PRS.

"Describe the procedures and information elements involved in the interaction between the SCEF and HSS, including configuration and reporting, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336.","The interaction between the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 involves several procedures for configuration and reporting. 

For configuration, the procedure is used for:
- The configuration or deletion of monitoring events for a User Equipment (UE) or a group of UEs.
- The deletion or addition of configured group-based monitoring events for certain UEs in a group.
- The configuration or deletion of communication patterns.
- The configuration or query of enhanced coverage restrictions.

For reporting, the procedure is used when invoked by the HSS to report:
- Changes in the association of the UE and UICC and/or new IMSI-IMEI-SV.
- UE reachability for SMS.
- Roaming status and changes in roaming status.

Additionally, it is used to:
- Update the SCEF with the suspend, resume, or cancel status of ongoing monitoring.
- Update the SCEF with information about the removal of communication patterns.
- Convey reports, status indications, and network parameter configurations for all or some UEs in a group.
- Update the SCEF about changes in previously accepted network parameter configurations due to a new Configuration-Information-Request command.

This reporting procedure is mapped to the commands Reporting-Information-Request and Reporting-Information-Answer in the Diameter application. The involved information elements are detailed in tables 7.2.2.1-1 and 7.2.2.1-2.

"Compare the PLMNwACT entries and their Radio Access Technology identifiers across different sections of TS 31.121. Highlight the differences in the RAT identifiers for the PLMN entries in sections 4.1.1.11, 4.4.3, and 4.8.3.","The PLMNwACT entries and their Radio Access Technology (RAT) identifiers vary across sections 4.1.1.11, 4.4.3, and 4.8.3 of TS 31.121. 

In section 4.1.1.11, the RAT identifiers for the first two PLMN entries are set to both UTRAN and GSM. Specifically, the 1st PLMN (244 081) has UTRAN as its RAT, and the 2nd PLMN (244 081) has GSM as its RAT. All subsequent PLMN entries (3rd to 12th) are set to UTRAN only.

In section 4.4.3, the RAT identifiers are set either to E-UTRAN only, UTRAN only, or GSM only. The 1st PLMN (244 081) has E-UTRAN as its RAT, and the 2nd PLMN (244 081) has GSM as its RAT. The remaining PLMN entries have a mix of E-UTRAN, UTRAN, and GSM RATs.

Similarly, section 4.8.3 follows the same pattern as section 4.4.3, with RAT identifiers set either to E-UTRAN only, UTRAN only, or GSM only. The 1st PLMN (244 081) has E-UTRAN as its RAT, and the 2nd PLMN (244 081) has GSM as its RAT. The remaining PLMN entries also have a mix of E-UTRAN, UTRAN, and GSM RATs.

Describe the floor control mechanisms for interworking in MCPTT systems as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.283.,"Floor control mechanisms for interworking in MCPTT systems, as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.283, apply to both private calls and group calls. Floor control involving a single MCPTT server is described, where the server manages floor control requests. When multiple MCPTT servers are involved, a primary MCPTT server is interconnected with a partner MCPTT server, and the primary server handles floor control arbitration.

Information flows for floor control between an MCPTT server and an Interworking Function (IWF) are based on interconnection definitions. These flows are crucial for managing floor control in interworking scenarios. Floor control aspects for interworking groups and private calls are also detailed, highlighting the roles of the MCPTT server and IWF.

For interworking groups, the group can be homed on either the MCPTT server or the LMR system. When homed on the MCPTT server, the floor control server resides on this server. Conversely, when homed on the LMR system, the floor control server is represented by the IWF. The primary MCPTT system of a group is defined by configuration and identified by the MC service group ID.

In scenarios involving multiple MCPTT systems, the partner MCPTT system may filter its users' floor requests before communicating with the primary MCPTT system's floor control server. Similarly, when interworking with an IWF, the MCPTT server or IWF can filter floor control requests based on the group's homing.

In private calls, either the IWF or MCPTT server acts as the controlling floor control server, managing arbitration of floor control requests from both users. The entity not fulfilling the controlling role sends all floor control requests to the controlling server without filtering. The allocation of the controlling floor control server functionality may depend on the system where the call originated or other criteria.

General cases of floor control in interworking groups and private calls are described, including scenarios where the LMR system or MCPTT system takes the controlling role. These mechanisms ensure efficient management of floor control requests and arbitration in interworking environments.","The answer should cover the application of floor control in both private and group calls, the roles of primary and partner MCPTT servers, and the information flows between MCPTT server and IWF. It should explain the homing of interworking groups, the filtering of floor control requests, and the arbitration role of the controlling floor control server in private calls. Additionally, it should include the general cases of floor control in interworking groups and private calls, highlighting the roles of LMR and MCPTT systems."
"What are the key performance requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD Intra frequency handover for CE UEs in CEModeA without SFN acquisition, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.331?","The key performance requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD Intra frequency handover for CE UEs in CEModeA without SFN acquisition are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.331. According to TS 36.521, the primary level settings include test tolerances and cell-specific test parameters. Specifically, the UE must complete the transmission of all repetitions of the PRACH to Cell 2 in less than 50 ms from the beginning of time period T3. Additionally, the rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%.

The handover delay is composed of two main components: the RRC procedure delay and Tinterrupt. The RRC procedure delay is specified as 15 ms in clause 11.2 of TS 36.331, while Tinterrupt is defined as 35 ms in clause 5.5.2.1.2 of TS 36.133, resulting in a total handover delay of 50 ms.

Furthermore, TS 36.331 outlines the UE performance requirements for procedures using a value N, which represents the number of 1ms subframes from the end of reception of the E-UTRAN -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> E-UTRAN response message, excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure, or physical layer synchronization.

"Describe the procedures and requirements for establishing, maintaining, and releasing a Firewall Traversal Tunnel to IMS (FTT-IMS) as per 3GPP TS 24.322.","To establish a Firewall Traversal Tunnel to IMS (FTT-IMS) via a restrictive non-3GPP access network, the User Equipment (UE) and the External Firewall Traversal Function (EFTF) must follow the UE requested FTT-IMS establishment procedure as outlined in subclause 5.2. Once established, IP packets are transported using the IP packet transport FTT-IMS procedure according to subclause 5.3. The IP protocol usage is defined in clause 6.

When the FTT-IMS is no longer needed, the UE can perform the UE requested FTT-IMS release procedure as per subclause 5.4, and the EFTF can perform the EFTF requested FTT-IMS release procedure according to subclause 5.5. It is important to note that keep-alive functionality is not defined in TS 24.322, but it can be maintained using the keep-alive functionality defined in 3GPP TS 24.229.

Regarding MAC address usage, if the UE has a network interface with a universally administered MAC address, it should use this address as the UE FTT-IMS MAC address. If not, a locally administered MAC address should be used, with the least significant bit of the last octet set to zero. For IPv4 connectivity, the UE must act as a DHCPv4 client according to IETF RFC 2131, and for IPv6 connectivity, it must support IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration according to IETF RFC 4862. The UE should create a link-local address using the UE FTT-IMS MAC address as per IETF RFC 4291.

Further IPv6 configuration can be done using stateless DHCPv6 according to IETF RFC 3736.

Describe the conditions under which the uplink TCI state is considered known according to 3GPP TS 38.533 and TS 38.133.,"The uplink TCI state is considered known if the following conditions are met:
- During the period from the last transmission of the RS resource used for the L1-RSRP measurement reporting for the target uplink TCI state to the completion of active uplink TCI state switch, where the RS resource for L1-RSRP measurement is the RS in target uplink TCI state or QCLed to the target uplink TCI state.
- Uplink TCI state switch command is received within 1280 ms upon the last transmission of the RS resource for beam reporting or measurement.
- The UE has sent at least one L1-RSRP report for the target uplink TCI state before the uplink TCI state switch command.
- The RS configured in target uplink TCI state remains detectable during the uplink TCI state switching period.
- SNR of the RS configured in target uplink TCI state is greater than or equal to -3dB.
- The target uplink TCI state remains detectable during the uplink TCI state switching period.
- The SSB associated with the uplink TCI state remains detectable during the uplink TCI switching period.
- SNR of the uplink TCI state is greater than or equal to -3dB.
- The SSB can be associated with either the serving cell PCI or a PCI different from the serving cell PCI.

Otherwise, the uplink TCI state is considered unknown.

Additionally, the requirements for UL TCI state switch using separate UL TCI state or joint TCI state of unified TCI state switch framework are specified. If the source RS in UL TCI state or joint TCI state is associated with a PCI different from that of the serving cell, the requirements apply if the cell with different PCI satisfies the known cell condition defined in clause 8.16.1 of TS 38.133. If the known cell condition is not met, longer delay may be expected. In case of joint TCI state switch, the UE is not expected to transmit on UL before completing the DL and UL TCI state switch.

For separate UL TCI state switch or joint TCI state switch for PUCCH or PUSCH, or semi-persistent/aperiodic/periodic SRS, when beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping is set to 1, upon receiving PDSCH carrying MAC-CE activation command in slot n on the serving cell, the UE shall be able to transmit uplink signal with the target TCI state in the slot n+THARQ + NM*(Tfirst_target-PL-RS + 4*Ttarget_PL-RS + 2ms) / NR slot length. If the target TCI state is unknown, the UE shall be able to transmit uplink signal with the target TCI state in the slot n+THARQ + (TL1-RSRP + Tfirst_target-PL-RS + 4*Ttarget_PL-RS + 2ms) / NR slot length.

The timing parameters are defined as follows:
- THARQ (in slot) is the timing between DL data transmission and acknowledgement as specified in TS 38.213.
- NM = 1, if the target PL-RS is not maintained by the UE, 0 otherwise.
- PL-RS is maintained provided the target PL-RS is associated with or included in the UL or joint TCI states in the active TCI list for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions, there are no more than 4 different RS configured as PL-RS per serving cell among all active UL (or joint) TCI states for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions, and conditions for known path loss reference signal in section 8.14.2 are fulfilled.
- Tfirst_target-PL-RS is the time to first pathloss RS transmission after L1-RSRP measurement when the target TCI state is unknown, or after MAC CE command is decoded by the UE for known TCI state.
- Ttarget_PL-RS is the periodicity of the target pathloss reference signal, which would be SSB or NZP CSI-RS when PL-RS is associated with the serving cell, or SSB when PL-RS is associated with PCI different from the serving cell.
- TL1-RSRP is the time for Rx beam refinement in FR2, defined as TL1-RSPR_Measurement_Period_SSB for SSB as specified in clause 9.5.4.1, with the assumption of M=1 and TReport = 0, or TL1-RSRP_Measurement_Period_CSI-RS for CSI-RS as specified in clause 9.5.4.2, with the assumption of M=1 for periodic CSI-RS, for aperiodic CSI-RS if the number of resources in the resource set is at least equal to MaxNumberRxBeam, and with TReport = 0.","The answer should cover the following key points:

The key components involved in this structure are:

1. **{apiRoot}**: This is a concatenation of several parts:
   - **Scheme**: Either 'http' or 'https'.
   - **Fixed string**: '://'.
   - **Authority**: Host and optional port, represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
   - **Optional deployment-specific string**: An API prefix that starts with a '/' character.

2. **<apiName>**: This defines the name of the API. For the Nlmf_Location API, the <apiName> is 'nlmf-loc'.

"Describe the key elements and functionalities of TCAPsec as specified in 3GPP TS 33.204, including the databases maintained by SS7-SEG, security policies, security associations, protection modes, and security header structure.","TCAPsec, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.204, encompasses several key elements and functionalities to ensure secure TCAP user signaling. 

1. **Databases Maintained by SS7-SEG**:
   - **SPD-SEG**: This database contains TCAPsec policy information, which defines the security policies for TCAPsec key management.
   - **SAD-SEG**: This database contains TCAPsec Security Association (SA) information. SS7-SEG monitors the SA hard expiry time and deletes expired SAs from the database.

2. **Operations Performed by SS7-SEG**:
   - SS7-SEG can secure TCAP user signaling by sending and receiving protected or unprotected messages based on the information in SPD-SEG and SAD-SEG. The structure of protected messages and the protection algorithms are defined within the specification.

3. **Security Policies for TCAPsec Key Management**:
   - **SPD Entries**: Define per peer network whether protection should be applied and, if so, which protection mode to use. SPD entries must be consistent across different SS7-SEGs within the same network.
   - **Fallback to Unprotected Mode**: This parameter, enabled or disabled per network, determines if unprotected traffic can be accepted. The use of the fallback indicator is specified in Annex B.
   - **Explicit Policy Configuration**: The SPD must contain an entry for each network the SS7-SEG is allowed to communicate with.
   - **Protection Granularity**: SPD administration is allowed on the TCAP user application part level for each network.
   - **Migration Support**: An SPD entry may contain two protection modes for the same network, allowing both modes for incoming messages but preferring one for outgoing messages.

4. **Security Association Data Elements**:
   - **SA Identification Attributes**: Include Network Ids and Security Parameters Index (SPI). The Destination Network Id is used to identify the SAD entry for traffic protection, while the SPI uniquely identifies a TCAPsec SA.
   - **Assigned Cryptographic Parameters per SPI**: Include encryption and integrity algorithm identifiers, keys, and SA lifetime. The SA hard and soft expiry times are defined in UTC format.

5. **Protection Modes**:
   - **Protection Mode 1**: Provides integrity and authenticity.
   - **Protection Mode 2**: Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
   - Secured TCAP user messages include a security header and a protected payload. The security header is transmitted in cleartext, while the protected payload varies based on the protection mode.

6. **Security Header Structure**:
   - **Protection Mode 1**: The security header consists of SPI and TVP (a 32-bit timestamp for replay protection).
   - **Protection Mode 2**: The security header includes SPI, TVP, SS7-SEG Id (unique per network), and a proprietary field (used to create different IV values for different protected messages).

In unacknowledged mode, additional procedures are required due to the unreliable nature of this mode, as described in subclause 6.7.3. A segment number is used to manage the segmentation process. Each SN-UNITDATA PDU is assigned a sequence number, starting at 0 for the first PDU of an N-PDU and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent PDU, with modulo 16 operation applied. This helps in tracking and re-ordering the received segments. If a timer (which is implementation dependent) expires before all segments are received, the segments are discarded. After re-ordering the segments, the reassembly operation described in subclauses 6.7.1 and 6.7.4 is performed to reconstruct the original data.

Thus, while the acknowledged mode strictly follows the general procedures, the unacknowledged mode incorporates additional steps to handle the unreliable transmission, ensuring data integrity through sequence numbering and re-ordering before reassembly.","The answer should include the general procedures for segmentation and reassembly as outlined in subclause 6.7.1. It should then describe how these procedures are applied in acknowledged mode as per subclause 6.7.2. For unacknowledged mode, the answer should detail the use of segment numbers, the sequence number assignment, modulo 16 operation, re-ordering of received segments, and the conditions under which segments are discarded. Finally, it should mention the reassembly operations after re-ordering as described in subclauses 6.7.1 and 6.7.4."
"Describe the process and requirements for creating, updating, and deleting an 'Individual V2V Configuration' resource.","The process for managing an 'Individual V2V Configuration' resource involves using HTTP methods POST, PUT, and DELETE, each serving distinct purposes:

1. **Creating an 'Individual V2V Configuration' Resource (HTTP POST):**
   - When the NF service consumer needs to provide a V2V configuration requirement, it sends an HTTP POST request to create the 'Individual V2V Configuration' resource.
   - The payload body of the POST request must include the V2vConfigurationData data structure, which should contain either the V2X group ID within the 'groupId' attribute or the V2X service ID within the 'serviceId' attribute. Optional attributes include a candidate Relay V2X-UE ID list within the 'canUeIds' attribute and application QoS requirements within the 'appQosReq' attribute.
   - Upon receiving the POST request, the VAE Server performs authorization based on the provided information. If successful, the server creates the resource, assigns it a URI as defined in the resource URI structure, and responds with a 201 Created message, including the URI in the Location header.
   - The NF service consumer uses this URI for subsequent requests related to the 'Individual Session Oriented Service Subscription'.

2. **Updating an 'Individual V2V Configuration' Resource (HTTP PUT):**
   - To update the resource, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP PUT request with the V2vConfigurationData data structure in the payload body. The V2X group ID and service ID must remain unchanged.
   - The VAE Server again performs authorization. If successful, it updates the resource and responds with either a 200 OK or 204 No Content status code.

3. **Deleting an 'Individual V2V Configuration' Resource (HTTP DELETE):**
   - The NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request to remove the resource identified by its URI.
   - The VAE Server checks if the resource exists. If it does, the server deletes it and responds with a 204 No Content success message.

**Resource URI Structure:**
The resource URI for the 'Individual V2V Configuration' is structured as `{apiRoot}/vae-pc5-prov-req/<apiVersion>/configurations/{configurationId}`, supporting variables defined in the relevant table.

**Error Handling:**
If errors occur during the processing of HTTP POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, the VAE Server applies error handling procedures as specified in the relevant clause.

Overall, the process involves careful handling of HTTP methods, authorization checks, and structured responses to ensure proper management of the 'Individual V2V Configuration' resource.","The answer must include:
  - A detailed description of the HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) used for managing the 'Individual V2V Configuration' resource.
  - The required and optional attributes in the V2vConfigurationData data structure.
  - The authorization process by the VAE Server and the response codes (201 Created, 200 OK, 204 No Content).
  - The structure of the resource URI and its variables.
  - The error handling procedures as specified in clause 6.8.7."
Describe the procedures and operations involved in SMF-NEF connection release and PDU session establishment as defined in 3GPP TS 29.541 and TS 33.128.,"The procedures and operations involved in SMF-NEF connection release and PDU session establishment are detailed in 3GPP TS 29.541 and TS 33.128. 

1. **Create Service Operation for SM Context in NEF (TS 29.541 5.2.2.2)**:
   - The Create service operation involves sending an HTTP POST request to the NEF to create an SM Context for a PDU session. The request body includes necessary data for the creation process.
   - Upon successful creation, the NEF responds with a 'Location' header containing the URI of the created SM Context resource. The response may include a 'SmContextCreatedData' object with relevant information.

2. **Delete Service Operation (TS 29.541 5.2.2.3.1)**:
   - The Delete service operation is invoked by an NF Service Consumer (e.g., SMF) towards the NEF to delete the SM Context for NIDD when the PDU session release is initiated.
   - The NF Service Consumer sends an HTTP POST request to the 'release' custom operation URI of the Individual SM Context resource. The request body contains a 'SmContextReleaseData' object.
   - On success, the NEF returns '204 No Content' if no information is to be returned, or '200 OK' with a 'SmContextReleasedData' object including necessary information such as Small Data Rate Control status or APN Rate Status.
   - On failure or redirection, appropriate HTTP status codes and a 'ProblemDetails' object are returned.

3. **Status Notify Service Operation (TS 29.541 5.2.2.4.1)**:
   - The Status Notify service operation is used by the NEF to inform the NF Service Consumer (e.g., SMF) about changes in the status of the Individual SM Context.
   - The NEF sends an HTTP POST request to the Notification URI received during the Create service operation. The request body includes a 'SmContextStatusNotification' object indicating the changed status.
   - On success, '204 No Content' is returned without a response body. On failure or redirection, appropriate HTTP status codes and a 'ProblemDetails' object are returned.

4. **Additional Requirements for Status Notify Service Operation (TS 29.541 5.2.2.4.2)**:
   - During NEF initiated SMF-NEF connection release, the NEF sends a Status Notification to inform the NF Service Consumer that the Individual SM Context is released.
   - The NEF sets the 'status' attribute in the request body to 'RELEASED'. If Small Data Rate Control or APN Rate Control is enforced, the response body includes the respective status information.

5. **NEFPDUSessionEstablishment Record Generation (TS 33.128 7.7.2.1.2)**:
   - The IRI-POI in the NEF generates an xIRI containing an NEFPDUSessionEstablishment record when an unstructured PDU session using NEF is established for the target UE.
   - The record is generated when the NEF returns a Nnef_SMContext_Create Response to the SMF, confirming the establishment of the unstructured PDU session and connection to the AF.

These procedures ensure proper handling and communication between the SMF and NEF during connection release and PDU session establishment, maintaining efficient network operations and resource management.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The Create service operation for SM Context in NEF, including the HTTP POST request and response handling as per TS 29.541 5.2.2.2.
- The Delete service operation, including the HTTP POST request, response codes, and the conditions under which the operation is invoked as per TS 29.541 5.2.2.3.1.

"Describe the authentication and identity verification process for a UE accessing a Presence Server/AP in a 3GPP network, including error handling and security parameter setup.","The authentication and identity verification process for a User Equipment (UE) accessing a Presence Server or Authentication Proxy (AP) in a 3GPP network involves several steps and considerations:

1. **Identity Verification Process**: 
   - The Presence Server, acting as a Network Application Function (NAF), can obtain subscriber identities over the Zn reference point as part of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) user security setting for presence. These identities may include the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMPI) and multiple IP Multimedia Public Identities (IMPUs).
   - The UE sends its preferred public user identity in each HTTP request. The Presence Server or AP verifies that this preferred identity is one of the IMPUs associated with the HTTP request.
   - If the Presence Server is behind an AP, the AP verifies the preferred identity before forwarding the request to the Presence Server. If no preferred identity is inserted, the AP inserts a default IMPU from the user profile. If the preferred identity validation fails, the HTTP request is dropped.

2. **Authentication Process**:
   - The authentication of the AP/Presence Server is performed according to the specified clauses in TS 33.222.
   - The authentication of the UE can occur either at the AP or the Presence Server. Subscriber authentication can also be performed using proprietary or non-3G standardized methods. If 3GPP authentication mechanisms are used, the authentication is based on the Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA), which supports different methods such as subscriber certificates or shared secrets.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Authentication failures are handled according to the relevant clauses in TS 33.222.
   - Specific error cases considered fatal include scenarios where none of the received ciphersuites include encryption, and the operator's policy requires encryption, or if the supported ciphersuites only include key material less than the required bits for confidentiality protection.

4. **Security Parameter Setup**:
   - Security parameters are set up according to the specified clauses in TS 33.222.

Overall, the process ensures secure and verified access to network application functions, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of subscriber identities and communications.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The process of obtaining and verifying subscriber identities over the Zn reference point, including the use of IMPI and IMPUs.
  - The role of the Presence Server and AP in verifying the preferred public user identity and handling default IMPU insertion.
  - The authentication process for the AP/Presence Server as per TS 33.222.
  - The authentication process for the UE, including the use of Generic Authentication Architecture and different methods such as subscriber certificates and shared secrets.
  - The handling of authentication failures and the specific error cases considered fatal, particularly related to ciphersuites and encryption policies.
  - The setup of security parameters as per TS 33.222."
"Describe the data coding process for both uplink and downlink as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003, including the parity bits, tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.","The data coding process for both uplink and downlink as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003 involves several steps, including the definition of parity bits, addition of tail bits, convolutional encoding, and puncturing schemes.

For the uplink:
1. **Parity Bits**: Twelve data parity bits p(0), p(1), ..., p(11) are defined such that the binary polynomial formed by the data bits and parity bits, when divided by the polynomial D12 + D11 + D10 + D8 + D5 + D4 + 1, yields a remainder equal to D11 + D10 + D9 + D8 + D7 + D6 + D5 + D4 + D3 + D2 + D + 1.
2. **Tail Bits**: Six tail bits equal to 0 are added to the information and parity bits, resulting in a block of 468 bits {u(0), u(1), ..., u(467)}. The bits are assigned as follows:
   - u(k) = d(k+40) for k = 0, 1, ..., 449
   - u(k) = p(k-450) for k = 450, 451, ..., 461
   - u(k) = 0 for k = 462, 463, ..., 467 (tail bits)
3. **Convolutional Encoder**: This block of 468 bits is encoded using the 1/3 rate convolutional mother code defined by the polynomials G4, G7, and G5. This results in a block of 1404 coded bits {C(0), C(1), ..., C(1403)}. The coded bits are calculated as:
   - C(3k) = u(k) + u(k-2) + u(k-3) + u(k-5) + u(k-6)
   - C(3k+1) = u(k) + u(k-1) + u(k-2) + u(k-3) + u(k-6)
   - C(3k+2) = u(k) + u(k-1) + u(k-4) + u(k-6) for k = 0, 1, ..., 467; u(k) = 0 for k < 0
4. **Puncturing Schemes**: The code is punctured depending on the value of the CPS field, resulting in a block of 612 coded bits {c1(0), c1(1), ..., c1(611)}. For the FANR procedure, if the PANI field is set to 0, the puncturing is the same as for EGPRS. If the PANI field is set to 1, additional bits are punctured, resulting in a block of 576 coded bits {pc1(0), pc1(1), ..., pc1(575)}.
5. **Second Half**: The same data coding process is applied to the second half with bits {d(40), d(41), ..., d(489)} replaced by bits {d(490), d(491), ..., d(939)}. This results in a block of 612 coded bits {c2(0), c2(1), ..., c2(611)}. If the PANI field is set to 1, additional bits are punctured, resulting in a block of 576 coded bits {pc2(0), pc2(1), ..., pc2(575)}.

For the downlink:
The data coding process is similar to the uplink, with the bits {d(40), d(41), ..., d(939)} replaced by bits {d(46), d(47), ..., d(945)}. This ensures consistency in the coding process for both uplink and downlink transmissions.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Definition and calculation of parity bits in GF(2) for uplink.
  - Addition of tail bits and formation of the block of 468 bits.
  - Convolutional encoding using specified polynomials and resulting in a block of 1404 coded bits.
  - Puncturing schemes applied based on CPS and PANI fields, resulting in blocks of 612 or 576 coded bits.
  - Data coding process for the second half of the uplink, including handling of the PANI field.
  - Data coding process for downlink, specifying the replacement of bits {d(40),d(41),…,d(939)} with bits {d(46),d(47),…,d(945)}."
"Describe the process and requirements for AS protection algorithm selection during a gNB change in a 5G network, including the roles of the source gNB, target gNB, and AMF.","During a gNB change in a 5G network, the process and requirements for AS protection algorithm selection involve several key steps and roles for the source gNB, target gNB, and AMF. 

1. **Algorithm Selection by Target gNB**: The target gNB is required to select the algorithm with the highest priority from the UE's 5G security capabilities. This selection is based on a locally configured prioritized list of algorithms, which applies to both integrity and ciphering algorithms. If the target gNB selects different algorithms compared to the source gNB, these chosen algorithms must be indicated to the UE in the Handover Command message.

2. **Transfer of Algorithms from Source gNB to Target gNB**: During the handover, the source gNB includes the UE's 5G security capabilities and the ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source cell in the handover request message. This information allows the target gNB to decipher and verify the integrity of the RRC Reestablishment Complete message on SRB1 in the potential RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure.

3. **Role of AMF**: The AMF plays a crucial role in verifying and updating the UE's security capabilities. After the handover, the target gNB sends the UE's 5G security capabilities received from the source gNB to the AMF in the Path-Switch message. The AMF verifies that these capabilities match the locally stored capabilities. If there is a mismatch, the AMF sends its locally stored 5G security capabilities to the target gNB in the Path-Switch Acknowledge message. The AMF also supports logging capabilities for this event and may take additional measures, such as raising an alarm.

4. **Signaling in Handover Command Message**: If the target gNB selects different algorithms from those used at the source gNB, it must signal the selected algorithms in the Handover Command message to the UE. This ensures that the UE is aware of the new algorithms to be used for integrity and ciphering protection.

5. **Expected Behavior and Verification by UE**: Upon receiving the Handover Command message, the UE checks the message authentication code and verifies the MAC in the handover complete message. The UE then selects and applies the AS integrity protection algorithm correctly.

6. **Logging and Additional Measures by AMF**: In case of a mismatch in security capabilities, the AMF logs the event and may take additional measures, such as raising an alarm, to ensure the security of the network.

Overall, the process ensures that the highest priority algorithms are selected and correctly applied during a gNB change, maintaining the integrity and security of the 5G network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The requirement for the target gNB to select the highest priority algorithm from the UE's 5G security capabilities.
2. The process of transferring ciphering and integrity algorithms from the source gNB to the target gNB during handover.
3. The role of the AMF in verifying and updating the UE's security capabilities.
4. The signaling of selected algorithms in the Handover Command message.
5. The expected behavior and verification steps for the UE upon receiving the Handover Command message.
6. The importance of logging and potential additional measures by the AMF in case of a mismatch in security capabilities."
Describe the process and HTTP status codes involved when a NF Service Consumer modifies a subscription or group subscription using the PATCH method towards the UDM.,"When a NF Service Consumer, such as NEF, needs to modify an existing subscription or group subscription towards the UDM, it uses the HTTP PATCH method with the URI of the individual subscription resource. The process involves sending a PATCH request to the resource representing the subscription. For individual subscriptions, the modification may include changes to the events subscribed or updating the event report options. For group subscriptions, the request body should contain a PatchItem with the JSON pointer to the '/excludeGpsiList' or '/includeGpsiList' object in the subscription.

Upon successful modification, the UDM responds with '204 No Content' if all instructions in the PATCH request are implemented. If some instructions are discarded, the UDM responds with '200 OK' including PatchResult to indicate the failed modifications. If the resource does not exist, such as when the subscriptionId cannot be found, the UDM returns '404 Not Found' with additional error information in the response body. If the modification cannot be accepted, the UDM returns '403 Forbidden' with additional error information in the response body. In case of failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with relevant error information in the PATCH response body.","The answer must include the process of sending a PATCH request by the NF Service Consumer to modify a subscription or group subscription, the URI of the individual subscription resource, the possible success responses (204 No Content, 200 OK with PatchResult), the possible failure responses (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden), and the inclusion of additional error information in the response body."
What are the conformance requirements for a Base Station (BS) operating in proximity or co-sited with another TDD or FDD BS as per 3GPP TS 25.142?,"According to 3GPP TS 25.142, the manufacturer must declare whether the Base Station (BS) under test is intended to operate in proximity to or co-sited with another Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) BS that includes uplink receive functionality operating on the first or second adjacent frequency. If the BS is intended to operate in proximity to another TDD or FDD BS, conformance with the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) requirement specified in subclause 6.6.2.2.2.2 is mandatory. ACLR is a measure of the power leakage from a transmitter into adjacent frequency channels, which is crucial for minimizing interference and ensuring efficient spectrum usage. On the other hand, if the BS is intended to be co-sited with another TDD or FDD BS, conformance with the ACLR requirement specified in subclause 6.6.2.2.2.3 is mandatory. This declaration and subsequent conformance ensure that the BS operates effectively without causing harmful interference to nearby systems.","The answer should include the necessity for the manufacturer to declare the operational conditions of the BS (proximity or co-sited with another BS). It should specify that if the BS is intended to operate in proximity, conformance with the ACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.2.2.2.2 is mandatory. If the BS is intended to be co-sited, conformance with the ACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.2.2.2.3 is mandatory. The answer should also briefly describe what ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio) is and why it is important."
"Describe the DSCP marking rules and procedures for downlink traffic in a 3GPP network, including the roles of ePDG and HA, and how QoS is managed.","In a 3GPP network, DSCP marking rules are established per QoS flow based on policies defined in the network. When tunneling UE downlink traffic, the network copies the DSCP value from the received IP header into the new outer header before forwarding it to the UE. Optionally, the network may perform DSCP marking remapping based on the operator's policy.

The ePDG plays a crucial role in managing DSCP marking for downlink traffic. When receiving a downlink data packet for a UE, the ePDG copies the DSCP marking value from the received IP header into the new IPSec header before forwarding it to the UE. If the anti-replay feature specified in IETF RFC 4301 is implemented, the ePDG should create a dedicated child SA for each IP flow with the same DSCP marking value. Alternatively, the ePDG may increase the IPsec anti-replay window size or use other implementation-specific methods to avoid out-of-sequence issues. The ePDG may also perform DSCP marking remapping based on the operator's policy.

Similarly, the HA sets DSCP marking on the IP outer header per QoS flow. If S2c data integrity protection is used and the IPsec anti-replay feature is implemented, the HA should create a dedicated child SA for each IP flow with the same DSCP marking value. The UE may choose to increase the IPsec anti-replay window size or use other methods to avoid out-of-sequence issues.

During EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' based access authentication, the 3GPP AAA server may enable the UE reflective QoS function. The fixed broadband access network may provide QoS on non-seamless WLAN offload traffic after successful 3GPP-based access authentication. When forwarding a downlink data packet to a UE, the fixed broadband access network may set the DSCP value on the outer IP header of each IP packet on a per-flow basis as specified in the network policies.","The answer should include the DSCP marking rules per QoS flow, the process of copying DSCP values from received IP headers, and the optional remapping based on operator's policy. It should detail the roles of ePDG and HA in managing DSCP marking, including the creation of dedicated child SAs for IP flows with the same DSCP marking value and methods to avoid out of sequence issues. Additionally, it should cover the reflective QoS function enabled during access authentication and the DSCP value setting by the fixed broadband access network."
What are the accuracy requirements for RSSI measurements in CA operation with a serving FDD or TDD cell as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The accuracy requirements for RSSI measurements in CA operation with a serving FDD or TDD cell, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521, are as follows:

1. **Absolute Accuracy of RSSI Measurements**: The RSSI measurements must be taken from a FS3 cell in CA operation with a serving FDD or TDD cell.

2. **Conditions for Valid Accuracy Requirements**:
   - All symbols during each RSSI measurement duration must be available for RSSI sampling within the same reporting interval.
   - RSSI at the UE receiver must meet the following conditions with respect to the configured channelOccupancyThreshold:
     - RSSI at the UE receiver is below channelOccupancyThreshold-, or
     - RSSI at the UE receiver is above channelOccupancyThreshold+,
     where  is the applicable RSSI measurement accuracy value from the RSSI measurement accuracy requirements specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 Clause 9.1.18.6.2.

Describe the synchronization procedures for the terminating side in both A/Gb and Iu modes as specified in 3GPP TS 29.007.,"The synchronization procedures for the terminating side in both A/Gb and Iu modes as specified in 3GPP TS 29.007 are detailed as follows:

1. **General Synchronization Procedures**:
   - The general synchronization procedures for the terminating side involve sending synchronization patterns to the User Equipment (UE) and searching for these patterns within valid frames. This process ensures that the MSC/IWF can establish a steady state of synchronization before proceeding with further communication.

2. **Multislot Transparent Operation**:
   - In multislot transparent operation, synchronization involves sending a specific pattern (1/OFF) to the UE, with certain bit positions containing substream numbers and multiframe alignment patterns. The MSC/IWF searches for these patterns within the frames received from the UE. A timer is started upon receipt of the synchronization pattern, and synchronization is maintained until the timer expires.

3. **A-TRAU Frames and Multiframe Alignment**:
   - Synchronization using A-TRAU frames involves setting data rates and sending multiframe structures with alignment patterns. The MSC/IWF searches for the multiframe alignment pattern and substream numbers within the received frames. Similar to multislot operation, a timer is started upon receipt of the synchronization pattern, and synchronization is maintained until the timer expires.

4. **RLP Link Establishment**:
   - In A/Gb mode, the MSC/IWF requires reception of V.110 or A-TRAU frames on all allocated traffic channels before replying to the MT's RLP link establishment request. In Iu mode, modem synchronization on the transit network is performed after establishing the physical connection, and the RLP establishment may be initiated by either the IWF or the UE.

5. **Synchronization Completion Criteria**:
   - For V.110 synchronization in A/Gb mode, the procedures described in subclause 9.2.3.4.1.1 are followed. For A-TRAU frame synchronization, the procedures described in subclause 9.2.3.4.1.2 are followed. Synchronization is considered complete once the frame synchronization procedure is successfully executed.

6. **Re-synchronization Process**:
   - In A/Gb mode, if the MSC/IWF detects a loss of frame synchronization, it initiates a re-synchronization process. This involves searching for the frame alignment pattern incoming from the RAN and handling multiframe alignment according to specified procedures. During re-synchronization, data continues to be sent towards the fixed network, and the RLP recovers any possible loss of data once synchronization is re-attained.

These procedures ensure reliable synchronization and communication between the MSC/IWF and the UE in both A/Gb and Iu modes.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The general synchronization procedures for the terminating side as outlined in Document 1.
- The specific steps and bit positions involved in synchronization for multislot transparent operation from Document 2.
- The use of A-TRAU frames and multiframe alignment patterns in synchronization from Document 3.
- The procedures for RLP link establishment and synchronization in both A/Gb and Iu modes from Document 4.
- The criteria for considering synchronization complete for V.110 and A-TRAU frames in A/Gb mode from Document 5.
- The re-synchronization process in case of loss of frame synchronization in A/Gb mode from Document 6."
"Explain the role and functionality of the UDSF and LISSF in the context of 3GPP specifications, including their interaction and the relevant API structures.","The UDSF (Unstructured Data Storage Function) acts as an NF Service Producer, providing a data repository service for unstructured data to NF service consumers. Any NF can use the UDSF to store unstructured data, which refers to data not defined in 3GPP specifications. The nudsf-dr API structure includes resource URI and applicable HTTP methods, facilitating interaction with the UDSF.

The LI (Lawful Interception) architecture for SMF (Session Management Function) and UPF (User Plane Function) interception involves the LISSF (LI State Storage Function). The LISSF manages interceptions by storing LI state information, allowing different SMFs within an SMF set to modify or stop interceptions at POIs (Points of Interception) in the UPF. This ensures continuity of interception even when the managing SMF changes.

The implementation of LI_ST (LI State) uses the Nudsf_DataRepository service, with the LISSF adopting the role of NF Service Provider. The LISSF can be a standalone function or part of the ADMF (Administration Function). The LIPF (LI Provisioning Function) provides necessary connection details, including apiRoot, apiVersion, realmId, and storageId values, along with authentication keys, to store state information over LI_ST using the LISSF.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The definition and role of UDSF in storing unstructured data.

What are the requirements and considerations for end-to-end latency in various messaging scenarios as specified in 3GPP TS 22.262 and TS 23.700?,"The requirements for end-to-end latency in various messaging scenarios as specified in 3GPP TS 22.262 and TS 23.700 are as follows:

1. **General Messaging Scenarios**:
   - **Point-to-Point Messaging**: The MSGin5G Service must support sending and receiving text or data messages with end-to-end latency less than 500 ms. This requirement is specified in clause 5.1 of 3GPP TS 22.262.
   - **Group Messaging**: Similar to point-to-point messaging, the end-to-end latency for group messaging must also be less than 500 ms.

   - **Application Originated Mobile Terminated (AOMT) Messaging**: The MSGin5G Service must support AOMT messaging with a maximum latency of 10 seconds while maintaining battery life of at least 3 months for small data traffic once every hour and typical sized IoT battery (200-500mAh). This requirement is specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 22.262.

3. **Factors Affecting Latency**:
   - The main factors affecting end-to-end latency in each messaging scenario include the receiving UE power saving states, paging, network congestion, and the efficiency of the underlying communication protocols.
   - Initial connection activation latencies may be longer depending on the receiving UE power saving states and paging.

4. **Ensuring Compliance**:
   - To ensure that the end-to-end latency in point-to-point, group, and broadcast messaging scenarios is less than 500 ms, network optimization techniques such as efficient paging, reducing network congestion, and improving protocol efficiency can be employed.
   - For AOMT messaging service, ensuring compliance with the 10-second latency requirement involves optimizing the application layer protocols and maintaining efficient battery usage strategies.

By addressing these requirements and considerations, the MSGin5G Service can effectively meet the specified latency standards for various messaging scenarios as outlined in 3GPP TS 22.262 and TS 23.700.","The answer must include the specific latency requirements for each messaging scenario as outlined in the documents. It should cover the general requirement of less than 500 ms for point-to-point, group, and broadcast messages, and the specific requirement of 10 seconds for application-to-point messages. Additionally, it should address the factors affecting latency and strategies to ensure compliance with these requirements."
What are the bandwidth requirements and configurations for LTE as specified in the 3GPP documents?,"The bandwidth requirements and configurations for LTE are detailed across several 3GPP documents. 

Document 2 specifies the channel bandwidths and transmission bandwidth configurations for LTE. It defines the relationship between the channel bandwidth (BWChannel) and the transmission bandwidth configuration (NRB), with the channel edges being the lowest and highest frequencies of the carrier separated by the channel bandwidth.

Documents 3 and 4 outline the performance requirements for CA CQI tests and CA UE demodulation tests with active Sidelink, respectively. These requirements are defined independently of CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Clause 5.6A.1. For UEs supporting different CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets, the applicability and test rules are provided for tests involving 2 DL CCs and 3 or more DL CCs.

Document 6 evaluates the capability of bandwidth and bandwidth scalability for LTE. It states that the maximum bandwidth of a component carrier is 20 MHz for LTE, and LTE Rel-15 supports carrier aggregation of up to thirty-two component carriers, reaching a maximum aggregated system bandwidth of 640 MHz. This document also confirms that LTE Rel-15 meets the bandwidth requirement of at least 100 MHz and supports six different bandwidths for a component carrier.

Documents 1 and 5 provide general information about LTE bandwidth requirements and scalability, emphasizing the importance of these configurations in ensuring efficient and effective LTE performance.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Definitions and relations between channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth configurations as per Document 2.
  - Performance requirements for CA CQI tests and CA UE demodulation tests with active Sidelink, including applicability and test rules for different CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets as per Documents 3 and 4.
  - Maximum bandwidth of component carriers and carrier aggregation capabilities, including the maximum aggregated system bandwidth as per Document 6.
  - General information about LTE bandwidth requirements and scalability as per Documents 1 and 5."
What are the requirements for Initialization and Media Segments in 3GP-DASH as defined in TS 26.247?,"In 3GP-DASH, as defined in TS 26.247, the requirements for Initialization and Media Segments are as follows:

1. **Initialization Segment**:
   - An Initialization Segment must be present before any Media Segment is processed within a Representation.
   - The Initialization Segment must conform to the 3GPP file format and adaptive streaming profile, carrying '3gh9' as the compatibility brand.
   - It must also conform to the Initialization Segment specifications in ISO/IEC 23009-1, clause 6.3.3.

2. **Media Segments**:
   - Media Segments must follow the boxed structure of the ISO-base media file format.
   - Media Segments are not self-initializing and must adhere to the format defined in clause 9.2.3 of TS 26.247.

3. **Single Media Segment Representation**:
   - If a Representation contains only a single Media Segment, it can either:
     1) Include an Initialization Segment as defined in clause 9.2.2 and one Media Segment as defined in clause 9.2.3.
     2) Use one Self-Initializing Media Segment, which must conform to the specifications in ISO/IEC 23009-1, clause 6.3.5.1.

Describe the transmit power time masks for different types of transmission boundaries as defined in the 3GPP TS 38.101 specifications.,"The 3GPP TS 38.101 specifications define various transmit power time masks for different types of transmission boundaries to manage transient periods between transmissions. 

For slot and long subslot transmission boundaries, the transient periods allowed between these transmissions are defined by the transmit power time mask. Specifically, for transitions and multiplexing between PUSCH-PUCCH and PUSCH-SRS, the time masks in clause 6.3.3.7 apply. For transitions between slot or long subslot and short subslot transmissions, the time masks in clause 6.3.3.8 apply. For short subslot transmission boundaries, the transient periods allowed between consecutive short subslot transmissions are defined by the time masks in clause 6.3.3.9.

Clause 6.3.3.9 further details the transmit power time mask for consecutive short subslot transmission boundaries, specifying that the transient period shall be equally shared, as illustrated in Figure 6.3.3.9-2. Additionally, Figure 6.3.3.9-3 shows the time mask for consecutive short subslot transmissions with a 1 symbol gap when a transient period is required on both sides of the symbol, particularly when 60 kHz SCS is used in FR1, where the transient period is 10 µs.

Clause 6.3.3.7 describes the PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS time mask, which defines the observation period between a sounding reference symbol (SRS) and adjacent PUSCH/PUCCH symbols and subsequent uplink transmissions. This time mask applies to all types of frame structures and their allowed PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS transmissions unless otherwise stated. Figures 6.3.3.7-1 and 6.3.3.7-2 illustrate the time masks when there is a transmission before or after, or both before and after SRS, depending on whether the transmissions are on the same or different antenna ports. Figure 6.3.3.7-3 shows the time mask for consecutive long subslot transmissions. A transient period of 15 µs applies before and after SRS transmission to all transmit component carriers (CCs) in carrier aggregation (CA) with the CC sounding SRS. UE RF requirements do not apply during this transient period.

Clause 6.3.3.8 defines the transmit power time mask for consecutive slot or long subslot transmission and short subslot transmission boundaries, with the specific time mask illustrated in Figure 6.3.3.8-1.

These time masks ensure proper management of transient periods between different types of transmissions, maintaining the integrity and performance of the communication system.","The answer should cover the definitions and purposes of the transmit power time masks for different transmission boundaries, including slot, long subslot, and short subslot transmissions. It should explain the transient periods allowed between these transmissions and reference the specific clauses and figures mentioned in the documents. Additionally, it should detail the PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS time mask and its application across different frame structures and antenna configurations."
"Describe the general Self-healing procedure as outlined in TS 32.541, including the specific steps supported by each functional block.","The general Self-healing procedure as outlined in TS 32.541 consists of two main parts: the monitoring part and the healing process part. The steps involved in this procedure are as follows:

Monitoring Part:
1. [SH01] The Self-healing Function continuously monitors the TCoSHs (Thresholds of Self-Healing).
2. [SH02] When a TCoSH is reached, an appropriate Self-healing Process is triggered.

Healing Process Part:
3. [SH03] The Self-healing Function gathers necessary information such as measurements, configuration management (CM) data, and testing results.
4. [SH04] Based on the TCoSH and gathered information, the Self-healing Function performs deep analysis and diagnosis, providing a result. If the result includes recovery actions, the process continues; otherwise, it ends.
5. [SH05] If needed, the configuration data prior to executing the recovery actions is backed up.
6. [SH06] If necessary, the Self-healing Function triggers the execution of the recovery actions.
7. [SH07] The Self-healing Function evaluates the result of the recovery actions:
   - If the fault is not resolved and the stop conditions are not met, the process repeats from SH03.
   - If the fault is resolved, the process moves to SH09.
   - If the stop conditions are met, the process moves to SH08.
8. [SH08] If necessary, a fallback is executed.
9. [SH09] The Self-healing Function emits a notification to report the result of the Self-healing Process.
10. [SH10] If necessary, the Self-healing Function logs the information of the performed recovery actions and important events during the process.

The functional blocks supporting each step are as follows:
- Document 2: Supports steps SH01 and SH02.
- Document 3: Supports step SH04.
- Document 4: Supports step SH06.
- Document 5: Supports step SH07.
- Document 6: Supports step SH08.

It is important to note that the detailed healing process for individual self-healing use cases may differ from this general description. For example, the order of execution of the steps may vary, the necessity of backing up configuration data (SH05) and executing a fallback (SH08) is determined on a case-by-case basis, and the need for logging information (SH10) and the details of the logged information are also decided based on specific use cases.","The answer should include a detailed description of the general Self-healing procedure, breaking down the steps SH01 to SH10. It should specify which functional blocks support each step, referencing the relevant documents. The monitoring part (SH01, SH02) and the healing process part (SH03 to SH10) should be clearly distinguished. Additionally, any remarks about the variability of the healing process based on individual use cases should be noted."
How are HTTP error responses structured and referenced in 5GC SBI APIs according to 3GPP specifications?,"HTTP error responses in 5GC SBI APIs are structured and referenced according to several 3GPP specifications. Firstly, valid HTTP response codes are used as error codes in HTTP responses, as described in clause 4.8 of TS 29.501 and clause 5.2.7 of TS 29.500. These responses may include a 'ProblemDetails' data structure, which is specified in clause 5.2.4.1 of TS 29.571.

For each HTTP method of an API, HTTP status codes are specified using response code tables, as outlined in clauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of TS 29.500. The OpenAPI specification files must include the mandatory HTTP status codes listed in Table 5.2.7.1-1 of TS 29.500 and the HTTP status codes from the response codes table for that HTTP method.

The 'ProblemDetails' data structure is part of the CommonData OpenAPI specification file in Annex A of TS 29.571. For example, in the OpenAPI specification, error responses such as 400 (Bad Request), 500 (Internal Server Error), and default (Generic Error) are referenced from the CommonData definitions provided in Annex A of TS 29.571.

An example implementation in an OpenAPI specification file might look like this:
```
paths:
  /users:

"Describe the procedures and considerations for E-SMLC when handling location requests and positioning methods for UEs, including NB-IoT UEs, as outlined in TS 23.271.","The E-SMLC (Evolved Serving Mobile Location Center) follows specific procedures when handling location requests and positioning methods for UEs (User Equipment), including NB-IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things) UEs, as outlined in TS 23.271. 

When the requested location information and accuracy can be satisfied based on parameters received from the MME (Mobility Management Entity), such as cell identity, the E-SMLC may send a Location Response immediately. If the requested location information indicates a last known location, the E-SMLC determines this based on the cell identity and sends a Location Response immediately. If the location information cannot be satisfied immediately, the E-SMLC determines the appropriate positioning method and initiates the specific message sequence for this method as described in clause 9.3a. If the positioning method returns position measurements, the E-SMLC uses them to compute a location estimate. In case of failure to obtain position measurements, the E-SMLC may use the current cell identity to derive an approximate location estimate. If an already computed location estimate is returned for a UE-based positioning method, the E-SMLC may verify its consistency with the current cell identity. If the location estimate does not meet the requested accuracy and sufficient response time remains, the E-SMLC may initiate a further location attempt using the same or a different positioning method. If only horizontal coordinates can be obtained when vertical coordinates are requested, the horizontal coordinates may be returned.

Special considerations are made for NB-IoT UEs, which may perform measurements for some positioning methods only when in ECM-IDLE state. An E-SMLC aware of this, possibly from an indication sent by the UE, may allow additional response time to the UE to obtain the measurements. Similarly, an MME aware of this from the UE access type may also allow additional time for a location session to complete.

When the UE requests its own location, the actions described in clause 9.3a are performed. If the UE requests location assistance data instead, the E-SMLC transfers this data to the UE as described in clause 9.3a.1. The E-SMLC determines the exact location assistance data to transfer based on the type of data specified by the UE, the UE location capabilities, and the current cell.

Additionally, the signalling procedures in UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network) are defined in TS 25.305 and TS 43.059, respectively. These references provide further context for the procedures and considerations involved in handling location requests and positioning methods for UEs.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The process E-SMLC follows when requested location information and accuracy can be satisfied based on parameters from MME.
  - How E-SMLC handles last known location and determines positioning methods.

"Describe the test purpose and conformance requirements for UE behavior in RRC_Connected state with multicast DRX configured, as specified in TS 38.523.","The test purpose (TP) for UE behavior in RRC_Connected state with multicast DRX configured is to ensure that when the UE receives a PTM transmission with G-RNTI and the data in the soft buffer of the corresponding HARQ process for MBS multicast was not successfully decoded, the UE starts the drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process after the expiry of drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM and monitors the G-RNTI PDCCH for drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM consecutive PDCCH occasions.

The conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.321, clause 5.7b, which includes the following parameters:
- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM: the maximum duration until a DL multicast retransmission is received.
- drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM: the minimum duration before a DL multicast assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.

When multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall:
1. Start the drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the expiry of drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM if the data of the corresponding HARQ process was not successfully decoded.
2. Monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213.
3. Start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback if HARQ feedback is enabled.

Describe the addressing schemes and connection procedures used by RANAP in the context of SCCP as defined in 3GPP TS 25.410.,"The Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) is utilized to support signalling messages between the Core Networks (CNs) and the Radio Network Controller (RNC). One of the user functions of SCCP, known as the Radio Access Network Application Part (RANAP), is defined to use one SCCP signalling connection per active User Equipment (UE) and CN for the transfer of layer 3 messages, as well as one SCCP signalling connection per Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) bearer service.

RANAP employs both connectionless and connection-oriented procedures to support its operations. The choice between these procedures for each layer 3 procedure is detailed in TS 25.413. RANAP can use Subsystem Number (SSN), Signalling Point Code (SPC), and/or Global Title (GT) as addressing schemes for SCCP, with the specific scheme chosen being at the operator's discretion.

When GT addressing is utilized, the following settings are mandated:
- SSN Indicator = 1 (RANAP SSN as defined in TS 23.003 must always be included).
- Global Title Indicator = 0100 (GT includes translation type, numbering plan, encoding scheme, and nature of address indicator).
- Translation Type = 0000 0000 (not used).
- Numbering Plan = 0001 (E.163/4).
- Nature of Address Indicator = 000 0100 (International Significant Number).
- Encoding Scheme = 0001 or 0010 (BCD, odd or even).
- Routing indicator = 0 or 1 (route on GT or PC/SSN).

When GT is used, it must be the E.164 address of the relevant node. The connection procedures for RANAP transactions are further detailed in subclauses of TS 25.410, including connection establishment (subclause 4.5.1.2), connection release (subclause 4.5.1.3), and handling abnormal conditions (subclause 4.5.1.4).

Additionally, for a given Mobile Switching Center (MSC), the RNC must be able to access RANAP and Access Link Control Application Part (ALCAP) either under the same MTP3b destination point code or under different point codes. Similarly, for a given RNC, the MSC must be able to access RANAP and ALCAP either under the same MTP3b destination point code or under different point codes.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the requirements and considerations for BSIC decoding in both idle and connected modes, as well as the synchronization assumptions for intra-site and inter-site networks.","The requirements for BSIC decoding in idle mode involve the Mobile Station (MS) checking the BSIC for each of the six strongest non-serving cell BCCH carriers at least every 30 seconds to confirm that it is monitoring the same cell. In connected mode, the MS prioritizes decoding the BSICs of BCCH carriers among the six strongest that are not currently being assessed, after averaging measurement results over two SACCH block periods. Feedback from MS manufacturers indicates that the overall impact of BSIC decoding is low, as it is less frequently executed compared to BCCH power measurements, and decoding failures are unlikely to result in cell reselection or handover failures. Therefore, modeling of the BCCH decoding process is not mandated, although it may be useful for considering the impact of neighbor cell quality during handover and cell reselection preparation phases.

Regarding synchronization assumptions, the study investigates both synchronized and asynchronous networks. For intra-site synchronization, TDMA frame alignment is assumed in both cases. For inter-site synchronization in synchronized networks, time slot alignment is assumed on a random basis with fixed offsets, without assuming TDMA frame alignment or multi-TDMA frame alignment. In asynchronous networks, no time slot or frame alignment (multi-frame, TDMA frame, time slot) is assumed for inter-site synchronization.","The answer should include the BSIC decoding requirements for idle mode, specifying the frequency and conditions under which the MS checks the BSIC of non-serving cell BCCH carriers. It should also cover the BSIC decoding requirements in connected mode, detailing the priority given to decoding BSICs of non-assessed BCCH carriers. Additionally, the answer should explain the synchronization assumptions for intra-site and inter-site networks, highlighting the differences between synchronized and asynchronous networks. The impact of BSIC decoding on cell selection and handover, as well as feedback from MS manufacturers regarding the BSIC decoding process, should also be included for completeness."
"Describe the bulk subscription process in 3GPP networks, including the roles of NEF, NRF, NF, UDM, and HSS, and how data is managed and shared among different instances.","The bulk subscription process in 3GPP networks involves several key components: NEF (Network Exposure Function), NRF (Network Repository Function), NF (Network Function), UDM (Unified Data Management), and HSS (Home Subscriber Server). 

The NEF plays a central role in the bulk subscription process. Based on operator configuration, the NEF may perform bulk subscriptions with NFs that provide necessary services. This process is controlled by local policies within the NEF, which determine the target events and UEs for bulk subscription. When the NEF subscribes for any UE, group of UEs, or all UEs, it subscribes to all relevant NFs that provide the necessary services. Upon receiving a bulk subscription request, the NFs store this information and notify the NEF when the corresponding events occur.

The NRF is responsible for registering newly instantiated NFs and their services. When an NF registers with the NRF, the NRF acknowledges the registration and notifies the NEF about the new NF and its supported services. The NEF then evaluates the NF services against pre-configured events and subscribes accordingly. When an event trigger occurs, the NF notifies the NEF with the requested information, which the NEF may store in the UDR (Unified Data Repository).

The UDM offers various services via the Nudm interface, including subscriber data management, UE context management, UE authentication, event exposure, and more. The UDM can operate in stateful mode, storing information locally, or in stateless mode, storing information externally in the UDR. In stateless mode, the UDM retrieves required data from the UDR, processes incoming requests, and may update or subscribe to data change notifications at the UDR. Bulk subscriptions are not applicable when data is shared among different UDM instances within a group, as identified by UDM Group ID.

The HSS, particularly the SBI capable HSS, offers services via the Nhss_ims interface, such as UE context management, subscriber data management, and UE authentication. Similar to the UDM, the HSS can operate in stateful or stateless modes. In stateless mode, the HSS uses the Ud interface to interact with the UDR. Bulk subscriptions are not applicable when data is shared among different HSS instances within a group, as identified by HSS Group ID.

Additionally, the enumeration HssAuthTypeInUri is used as a variable part of resource URIs, following the naming convention used in URIs.

Overall, the bulk subscription process in 3GPP networks involves coordinated interactions between NEF, NRF, NF, UDM, and HSS, with careful management and sharing of data among different instances to ensure efficient and accurate event notifications and service delivery.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Explanation of the bulk subscription process as described in TS 23.502, including NEF's role in subscribing to NF services and handling event notifications.

2. **Polarization**: Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power from the test antenna is captured by the AAS BS under test.

3. **Beam Configuration**: Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier. Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band and Radio Access Technology (RAT) as the Orthogonal Sub-Domain Decomposition (OSDD) being tested according to the appropriate test configuration.

4. **Signal Generation**: Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit the test signal as specified for the relevant RAT:
   - For UTRA FDD: 12.2 kbps DPCH with reference measurement channel defined in annex A in TS 25.141.
   - For UTRA TDD: UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in annex A.2.1 in TS 25.142.
   - For E-UTRA: The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.4.
   - For NR: The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.5.

5. **Power Setting**: Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the AAS BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified.

6. **Measurement**: Measure the throughput according to annex A in TS 38.141-2 for NR. The throughput measured must be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in TS 38.104 annex A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.2.5.5-1.

7. **Repetition**: Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the AAS BS and supported polarizations. For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

By following these steps, the throughput measurement for a carrier in a 3GPP compliant test setup can be accurately performed, ensuring compliance with the specified requirements.","The answer must include the requirement that the measured throughput should be at least 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel. It should also detail the setup process for the AAS BS, including placement, alignment, polarization, beam direction configuration, signal generation, power setting, and the specific measurement steps for throughput as per the relevant 3GPP specifications."
What are the requirements and test cases for ensuring NAS signalling integrity and replay protection in AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 and TS 33.512?,"The requirements and test cases for ensuring NAS signalling integrity and replay protection in AMF are detailed in 3GPP TS 33.501 and TS 33.512. 

The AMF is required to support integrity protection and replay protection for NAS-signalling. The supported integrity protection algorithms include NIA-0, 128-NIA1, 128-NIA2, and optionally 128-NIA3. NIA0 must be disabled in deployments where unauthenticated emergency sessions are not a regulatory requirement. All NAS signalling messages, except those explicitly listed as exceptions, must be integrity-protected with an algorithm other than NIA-0, except for emergency calls.

To verify replay protection, the test case TC_NAS_REPLAY_AMF involves capturing NAS signalling messages between the UE and AMF, filtering the NAS Security Mode Complete message, and attempting to replay the captured packets. The expected result is that the AMF provides replay protection by ignoring the replayed packets if no corresponding response is sent.

For NAS NULL integrity protection, the test case TC_NAS_NULL_INT_AMF involves initiating both emergency and non-emergency registrations, deriving the KAMF and NAS signalling keys, and sending the NAS Security Mode Command message to the UE. The expected result is that the integrity algorithm selected by the AMF is different from NIA0 and the NAS Security Mode Command message is integrity protected.

The requirement for NAS integrity algorithm selection and use is verified by the test case TC_NAS_INT_SELECTION_USE_AMF. This involves sending a Registration Request from the UE, filtering the Security Mode Command and Security Mode Complete messages, and examining the selected integrity algorithm against the ordered list and UE's 5G security capabilities. The expected result is that the selected integrity algorithm has the highest priority and the MAC verification of the Security Mode Complete message is successful.

Ensuring the highest priority NAS integrity algorithm is selected and used according to the ordered list and UE's 5G security capabilities is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of NAS signalling messages.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The AMF's role in supporting integrity and replay protection for NAS-signalling.
  - The specific integrity protection algorithms supported by AMF and the conditions for disabling NIA0.
  - The detailed steps and expected outcomes for the test cases verifying replay protection (TC_NAS_REPLAY_AMF), NAS NULL integrity protection (TC_NAS_NULL_INT_AMF), and NAS integrity algorithm selection and use (TC_NAS_INT_SELECTION_USE_AMF).
  - The importance of ensuring the highest priority NAS integrity algorithm is selected and used according to the ordered list and UE's 5G security capabilities."

"Describe the new functionalities and procedures introduced in the latest 3GPP TS 23.700 specifications, focusing on network functions, UE onboarding, and NF load analytics.","The latest 3GPP TS 23.700 specifications introduce several new functionalities and procedures across different areas:

1. **Network Functions**:
   - A new network function called AIF (Artificial Intelligence Function) is introduced. The AIF is responsible for providing Machine Learning (ML) Model training and ML Model exposure services. This function interacts with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) by providing ML Models upon request. Additionally, the Network Repository Function (NRF) now includes a list of ML Model IDs in the NF profile.

2. **UE Onboarding**:
   - A Control Plane-based solution for onboarding and configuring User Equipment (UEs) is detailed. The procedure includes several steps:
     - **UE Pre-configuration**: Default UE credentials are provided to allow successful UE authentication.
     - **Initial Access/Registration**: The UE identifies that it has no subscription to access a Standalone Non-Public Network (SNPN) and selects an Onboarding SNPN (O-SNPN) based on broadcasted information. The UE registers for onboarding services, providing device-specific information such as its Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI) and default UE credentials.
     - **Authentication**: The network authenticates the UE using either primary authentication or Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA).
     - **Control Plane UE Provisioning**: Subscription credentials and configuration data are retrieved from the provisioning server and provisioned to the UE.
     - **Regular Registration**: After provisioning, the UE de-registers from the O-SNPN and performs a regular registration procedure to the Serving SNPN (SO-SNPN) with the provisioned subscription credentials.

3. **NF Load Analytics**:

How does the Fixed Dialling Number (FDN) service interact with URI addresses and supplementary services in 3GPP specifications?,"The Fixed Dialling Number (FDN) service in 3GPP specifications interacts with URI addresses and supplementary services through several mechanisms. 

Firstly, the EFFDNURI file contains a list of Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN) stored in URI address format, along with an optional alpha-tagging. The URI Address is coded similarly to the URI TLV data object in EFIMPU, and the alpha-tagging can use either the SMS default 7-bit coded alphabet or UCS2 coded options. When FDN is enabled, the Mobile Equipment (ME) only allows outgoing calls to destination addresses listed in EFFDNURI, following the same principles as the Fixed Number Dialling description applied to URI addresses.

Secondly, the procedure for checking called numbers and supplementary service control strings involves verifying the destination address using the FDN stored in EFFDNURI. This applies to IMS URI addresses as well, ensuring that the ME checks the destination address using the principles defined for Fixed Dialling Numbers.

Additionally, the FDN service can be enabled simultaneously with MO Short Message Control. When FDN is enabled, the ME follows the Call Control procedure, where the number or called address in the procedure refers to both the SMS destination address and the SMSC address.

Finally, the ME is required to support the CALL CONTROL facility as defined in TS 31.111 clause 7.3.1.4, ensuring consistent application of call control procedures across different services and address formats.","The answer should cover the structure and content of EFFDNURI, including URI Address and Alpha Identifier.

What are the key specifications and procedures for testing AWGN interferer characteristics and performance requirements in a base station according to 3GPP TS 25.142?,"According to 3GPP TS 25.142, the key specifications and procedures for testing AWGN interferer characteristics and performance requirements in a base station include several detailed steps and requirements:

1. **AWGN Interferer Characteristics**:
   - The minimum bandwidth of the AWGN interferer must be 1.5 times the chip rate of the radio access mode. For example, this would be 5.76 MHz for a chip rate of 3.84 Mcps and 1.92 MHz for a chip rate of 1.28 Mcps.
   - The flatness across this minimum bandwidth should be within 0.5 dB.
   - The peak to average ratio at a probability of 0.001% should exceed 10 dB.

2. **Testing Procedures**:
   - **Connection Setup**: Connect the BS tester (UE simulator), generating the wanted signal, and a band-limited white noise source, generating the interfering AWGN signal, to the antenna connector of one BS Rx port. Terminate or disable any other BS Rx port not under test.
   - **Transmission**: Start transmission from the BS tester to the BS using the UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in Annex A.2.1.
   - **Signal Level Adjustment**: Adjust the level of the BS tester output signal measured at the BS antenna connector as specified in the relevant tables (7.4, 7.3A, 7.4B). Similarly, adjust the power spectral density of the band-limited white noise source measured at the BS antenna connector as specified in these tables. Ensure the characteristics of the white noise source comply with the AWGN interferer definition in subclause 5.18.

3. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Performance requirements for the BS are specified for the measurement channels defined in Annex A and the propagation conditions in Annex B. These requirements apply only to the measurement channels supported by the base station.
   - Optional performance requirements are specified for high-speed train conditions defined in Annex B.3.
   - All Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) measurements must be carried out according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 and Annex F.
   - Performance requirements generally apply to a single carrier only. For a BS supporting MC-HSUPA, requirements are defined in terms of single carrier performance.
   - The characteristics of the white noise source simulating interference from other cells (Ioc) must comply with the AWGN interferer definition in subclause 5.18.
   - Requirements apply to a base station with dual receiver antenna diversity unless otherwise stated. The required Îor/Ioc must be applied separately at each antenna port.

These specifications and procedures ensure that the base station meets the necessary performance standards and can effectively handle AWGN interference during operation.","The answer should include the minimum bandwidth requirements for AWGN interferer, flatness and peak to average ratio specifications.

Describe the requirements and test cases for UE NR security capabilities in the context of EN-DC connections and X2-handovers as specified in TS 33.216.,"The requirements for UE NR security capabilities in the context of EN-DC connections and X2-handovers are specified in TS 33.216. 

For EN-DC connections, the requirement states that the UE NR security capabilities are only sent to a Secondary gNB (SgNB) when adding the SgNB during the establishment of an EN-DC connection. This is detailed in TS 33.401, clause E.3.4.3. The test case designed to verify this requirement is named TC_NR_SEC_CAP_SENT. The purpose of this test case is to ensure that the UE NR security capabilities are only sent to the SgNB. The pre-conditions for this test include having the UE, gNB, and eNB network products connected in the test environment, with the UE and gNB possibly being simulated, and the tester having access to the X2 interface. The execution steps involve triggering the MeNB to send an SN addition request message to a SgNB, triggering a handover of the UE from the MeNB to another eNB, and checking if the UE NR security capabilities were sent in the X2 interface during both steps. The expected result is that the UE NR security capabilities are only sent to the SgNB, with evidence provided in the form of screenshots containing the operation results.

For X2-handovers, the requirement specifies that a target eNB that has received the UE NR security capabilities during handover must include these capabilities in the S1-PATH SWITCH-REQUEST message, as outlined in TS 33.401, clause E.3.4.3. The test case for this requirement is named TC_BID_DOWN_X2, and its purpose is to verify that bidding down is prevented in X2-handovers when the target eNB receives the NR security capability. The pre-conditions for this test include having a test environment with a source eNB and a target eNB, with the source eNB possibly being simulated. The execution steps involve the target eNB sending the path-switch message to the MME. The expected result is that the UE NR security capability is included in the path-switch message, with evidence provided in the form of snapshots containing the result.

These requirements and test cases are significant in ensuring secure communication during EN-DC connections and preventing bidding down during X2-handovers, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the network.","The answer should include the specific requirements for UE NR security capabilities in EN-DC connections and X2-handovers.

Additionally, the answer should explain the significance of these requirements in ensuring secure communication and preventing bidding down during handovers."
Describe the lawful interception (LI) architecture and functions for Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios.,"The lawful interception (LI) architecture and functions for Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) vary depending on whether the scenario is non-roaming or roaming.

In a non-roaming scenario, the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) is responsible for providing the Interception Related Information Point of Interception (IRI-POI) and Communication Content Point of Interception (CC-POI). The Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) also provides these functions and terminates the Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel with the Service Capability Server/Application Server (SCS/AS), having the same capabilities as the SCEF for NIDD. Additionally, the Serving Gateway (SGW) provides IRI-POI and CC-POI for IP and Ethernet-based PDN connections.

In a roaming scenario, the Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF) in the visited network provides the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions, while the SCEF in the home network provides these functions for the home network. Similarly, the SGW in the visited network and the PGW in the home network provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions. The user plane packets between the User Equipment (UE) and PGW flow through the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and SGW.

It is important to note that only home-routed mode applies in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios for NIDD. The LI architecture for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel is the same as presented in figure 6.3-2, and the user plane packet flow is illustrated in figures 7.10-2 and 7.10-4. The same xIRIs and xCC specified for PDN connections of IP or Ethernet type are also considered for PDN connections for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel, considering unstructured payload format.","The answer should include:
- Explanation of IRI-POI and CC-POI functions.
- Description of the roles of SCEF and IWK-SCEF in non-roaming and roaming scenarios.
- Description of the roles of PGW and SGW in non-roaming and roaming scenarios.
- Mention of home-routed mode applicability.
- Reference to relevant figures (6.3-2, 7.10-2, 7.10-4) for packet flow and LI architecture.
- Consideration of unstructured payload format for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel."
"How does the EES notify the EAS with UE location information, and what are the procedures for handling redirection and errors?","The EES (Event Exposure Service) notifies the EAS (Event Analytics Service) with UE (User Equipment) location information when such information is available either locally cached or from the 3GPP core network. To notify the UE location information events, the EES sends an HTTP POST message using the Notification Destination URI received in the subscription request. The body of the HTTP POST message includes LocationNotification, which contains the location information of each UE with accuracy, timestamp, and type. The location information may be an actual location change or a predictive location report from various sources such as the UE mobility analytics report from NEF (Network Exposure Function), SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function), LCS (Location Service), or NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function).

Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the EAS processes the Location Notification. If the EAS fails to process the notification, it must take proper error handling actions and respond to the EES with an appropriate error status code. If the EAS determines that the received HTTP POST message needs to be redirected, it may respond with an HTTP '307 Temporary Redirect' or '308 Permanent Redirect' status code, including an HTTP 'Location' header containing an alternative URI representing the endpoint of an alternative EAS where the notification should be redirected. The procedures for redirecting HTTP requests involve the SCS/AS (Service Capability Server/Application Server) sending the HTTP request towards the new target entity specified in the Location header field of the redirect response.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The conditions under which the EES notifies the EAS with UE location information.
  - The format and contents of the HTTP POST message used for notification.
  - The sources of UE location information.
  - The error handling actions that the EAS should take upon failure to process the notification.
  - The procedures for redirecting HTTP requests, including the use of '307 Temporary Redirect' and '308 Permanent Redirect' status codes and the Location header field."
"Describe the procedure for initiating a one-to-one file distribution request in an MCData system, including the information flow and key steps involved.","The procedure for initiating a one-to-one file distribution request in an MCData system involves several key steps and information flows. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Pre-conditions**:
   - Both MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 must be registered for receiving MCData service.
   - Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be used.
   - The MCData server must have subscribed to the MCData functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.

2. **Initiating the Request**:
   - The user at MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to the chosen MCData user.
   - MCData client 1 sends an MCData FD request towards the MCData server, including file metadata information in the SDP. The request contains the selected MCData user for one-to-one data communication, a conversation identifier for message thread indication, and may include additional implementation-specific information in the application metadata container. It may also contain a mandatory download indication and a download completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1. A functional alias may be included within the FD data transfer to address the target MCData client 2.

3. **Handling Emergency Indicators**:
   - If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency file distribution communication or if the MCData emergency state is already set for MCData client 1, the MCData FD request must contain an emergency indicator. If the emergency state is not already set, MCData client 1 sets its MCData emergency state, which is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user.

4. **Authorization and Functional Alias Resolution**:
   - The MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is authorized to send the MCData FD request and verifies the functional alias, if present. If the functional alias is used to address the target MCData user, the MCData server resolves it to the corresponding MCData ID(s) and proceeds with the next steps. If the functional alias is active for multiple MCData users, the server selects an appropriate MCData ID based on some selection criteria.

5. **Response and Data Transmission**:
   - The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias resolution response message containing the resolved MCData ID.
   - MCData client 1 sends a new MCData FD request towards the resolved MCData ID.
   - The MCData server applies transmission and reception control and necessary policies to ensure appropriate data transmission between the MCData UEs.
   - The MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards the determined MCData users, including the emergency indicator if present.

6. **User Notification and Response**:
   - The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData FD request, which may be accepted, rejected, or ignored. If the request includes a mandatory download indication, an accepted response is assumed.
   - If the target MCData user 2 provides a response, MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the MCData server, which forwards it back to MCData client 1.

7. **File Distribution and Completion**:
   - MCData client 1 distributes the file over the established media plane to the MCData server.
   - The MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to MCData client 2 over the established media plane. If requested, a file download report is shared by MCData client 2. After the file transaction is completed, the media plane is released, and MCData client 2 records the file download completion and notifies MCData user 2.
   - MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report if requested by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData server may store this report for download history interrogation by authorized MCData users and sends it to the user at MCData client 1.

This procedure ensures a structured and secure method for one-to-one file distribution within an MCData system, handling various conditions such as emergency indicators and functional alias usage.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - Pre-conditions for initiating the file distribution request.
  - Steps involved in the procedure, from initiating the request to file distribution completion.
  - Information flow for MCData FD request and response.
  - Handling of emergency indicators and functional aliases.
  - Role of the MCData server in authorizing requests, resolving functional aliases, and managing data transmission.
  - User notifications and responses at the receiving MCData client.
  - Final steps including file distribution, download completion report, and media plane release."

The determination of gain factors βec and βed,k depends on the E-TFCI values and signaling from higher layers. E-TFCIec,boost may be signalled by higher layers, with a default value of 127 if not signalled. When UL_MIMO_Enabled is TRUE, the UE assumes E-TFCIec,boost = -1 for rank-2 transmissions. For E-TFCI ≤ E-TFCIec,boost, βec is derived based on the quantized amplitude ratio Aec, translated from ΔE-DPCCH signalled by higher layers, as specified in Table 1B. For E-TFCI > E-TFCIec,boost, βec is derived based on a traffic to total pilot power offset ΔT2TP, configured by higher layers, and the quantization of the ratio βec/βc as specified in Table 1B.0A.

Similarly, βed,k is computed based on reference gain factors, the spreading factor for E-DPDCHk, HARQ offsets, and the quantization of the ratio βed,k/βc into amplitude ratios specified in Table 1B.2 for E-TFCI ≤ E-TFCIec,boost and Table 1B.2B for E-TFCI > E-TFCIec,boost. The reference gain factors are derived from the quantized amplitude ratios Aed, translated from ΔE-DPDCH signalled by higher layers, as specified in Table 1B.1 for E-TFCI ≤ E-TFCIec,boost and Table 1B.2A for E-TFCI > E-TFCIec,boost.

In MIMO mode, when the UE transmits two transport blocks, the amplitude ratios Aed for the primary stream are modified to account for inter-stream interference, while the secondary stream ratios remain unchanged. The modified amplitude ratios Aed for the primary stream are given by Aed = Aed, ISI x AISI, where Aed,ISI is translated from ΔE-DPDCH signalled by higher layers, as specified in Table 1B.2A, and AISI is an inter-stream interference compensation factor translated from ΔISI signalled by higher layers according to Table 1B.0B.

The IQ branch mapping for E-DPDCHs and E-DPCCH is determined based on Nmax-dpdch and whether an HS-DSCH is configured for the UE, as specified in Table 1C. The E-DPCCH is always mapped to the I branch (iqec = 1), while the mapping for E-DPDCHs depends on the configuration.

For S-DPCCH, the gain factor βsc is derived based on the quantized amplitude ratios Asc, translated from ΔS-DPCCH signalled by higher layers, as described in Table 1C.1, when no transmission on E-DCH is taking place or when E-TFCI ≤ E-TFCIec,boost. For E-TFCI > E-TFCIec,boost, βsc is derived based on the traffic to secondary pilot power offset ΔT2SP, configured by higher layers, following the definition of ΔT2TP as specified in Table 1B.0 and the quantization of the ratio βsc/βc following the quantization of βec/βc as specified in Table 1B.0A. When a set of S-E-DPDCHs are present in a TTI, the S-DPCCH gain factor βsc is set equal to βec for that TTI.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The spreading operation for E-DPDCHs and E-DPCCH, including the use of channelisation codes cec and ced,k.
  - The determination of gain factors βec and βed,k based on E-TFCI values and higher layer signaling.
  - The role of E-TFCIec,boost and its default value, as well as its impact on gain factor calculations.
  - The quantization process for amplitude ratios and the relevant tables for different E-TFCI conditions.
  - The inter-stream interference compensation in MIMO mode and its effect on amplitude ratios for the primary stream.
  - The IQ branch mapping for E-DPDCHs and E-DPCCH.
  - The gain factor determination for S-DPCCH (βsc) in different transmission scenarios and its relation to βec when S-E-DPDCHs are present."
What are the codec mode handling and requirements for MTSI clients and media gateways as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114?,"The codec mode handling and requirements for MTSI clients and media gateways as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114 include several key aspects:

1. **Default Encapsulation Parameters**: When the radio access bearer technology is unknown to the MTSI client, the default encapsulation parameters defined in Table 7.1 are used.

2. **Negotiation of Codec Modes and Parameters**: Codec modes and other parameters such as mode-change-capability, mode-change-period, and mode-change-neighbor are negotiated as described in clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.2.3.

3. **Handling of Codec Mode Changes for AMR and AMR-WB Encoded Media**: Codec mode changes should be aligned to every other frame border and performed to one of the neighboring codec modes in the negotiated mode set. The highest codec mode of the negotiated mode-set should be used in transmitted media unless restricted by the most recently received Codec Mode Request (CMR). In received media, codec mode changes are accepted at any frame border and to any codec mode within the negotiated mode set.

4. **Use of Bandwidth-Efficient Payload Format**: The bandwidth-efficient payload format should be used for AMR and AMR-WB encoded media unless the session setup determines that the octet-aligned payload format must be used.

5. **Codec Mode Requests**: For AMR and AMR-WB, if the highest mode within the negotiated mode-set is acceptable for media reception, the MTSI client in the terminal should indicate that no codec mode request is present or indicate the CMR value corresponding to the highest mode within the negotiated mode-set in every outgoing RTP packet. The MTSI client should accept that the remote party sends with lower modes within the negotiated mode-set than requested by the CMR and follow each received CMR, not using higher modes in media-encoding than indicated by the most recently received CMR.

6. **Frame Aggregation and Redundancy Requirements**: The MTSI client should send one speech frame encapsulated in each RTP packet unless the session setup or adaptation request defines another encapsulation variant. The client should request to receive one speech frame encapsulated in each RTP packet but accept any number of frames per RTP packet up to the maximum limit of 12 speech frames per RTP packet.

7. **Specific Requirements for MTSI Media Gateways**: MTSI media gateways supporting speech communication between an MTSI client in terminal using 3GPP access and terminals operating in the CS domain in GERAN and UTRAN should support Tandem-Free Operation (TFO) and Transcoder-Free Operation (TrFO). They should support specific AMR speech codec modes and configurations, and restrict codec mode changes to be aligned to every other frame border and to neighboring codec modes within the negotiated codec mode set. For wideband speech communication, they should support specific AMR-WB codec modes and configurations, and also support narrowband speech communications. When offering both wideband and narrowband speech communication, wideband should be listed as the first payload type in the SDP offer.

These requirements ensure efficient and reliable handling of codec modes and media transmission for MTSI clients and media gateways.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Default encapsulation parameters when radio access bearer technology is unknown.
  - Negotiation of codec modes and parameters.
  - Handling of codec mode changes for AMR and AMR-WB encoded media.
  - Use of bandwidth-efficient payload format.
  - Codec mode requests and their handling in RTP packets.
  - Frame aggregation and redundancy requirements.
  - Specific requirements for MTSI media gateways, including support for TFO and TrFO, and restrictions on codec mode changes."
Describe the key components and interaction paradigms of Management Services (MnS) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.533.,"Management Services (MnS) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.533 consist of several key components and interaction paradigms. 

Firstly, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are essential for managing managed objects. These operations, along with notifications to report changes related to managed objects and their attributes, form the MnS component type A. This component type is network agnostic, meaning it does not involve any information related to the managed network, making the operations and notifications generic.

MnS is composed of different component types: MnS component type A, MnS component type B, and MnS component type C. Component type A includes generic management operations and notifications, while component type B and C carry specific information about the management service components in their metadata attributes. Examples of management service instances with various combinations of these components illustrate how they work together to provide comprehensive management services.

The interaction paradigms between the management service producer and consumer are crucial for the functioning of MnS. These paradigms include:

1. **Request-response**: The management service consumer requests an operation from the producer, which then performs an action or provides information in response.
2. **Subscribe-notify**: The consumer subscribes to receive network events via notifications from the producer, under specified filter constraints.
3. **Connect-streaming**: The producer establishes a connection with the consumer to stream management data when ready.
4. **Request-response with access control (explicit authentication and authorization)**: The consumer requests authentication and authorization from the producer, which then verifies the access token before providing the requested management services.
5. **Request-response with access control (implicit authentication and authorization)**: The consumer initiates a session, and the producer handles authentication and access control using local policies applicable to the current authentication context.

These paradigms ensure secure and efficient communication and data exchange between management service producers and consumers, facilitating effective network management.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Definition and role of CRUD operations in managing managed objects and reporting changes.
- Explanation of MnS component type A and its network agnostic nature.
- Composition of MnS with component types A, B, and C, and examples of management service instances.
- Detailed description of the interaction paradigms: request-response, subscribe-notify, connect-streaming, and request-response with access control (explicit and implicit authentication and authorization)."
"Explain the relationship between the global frequency raster, channel raster, and NR-ARFCN in the context of 3GPP TS 38.108 specifications. How are these elements used to identify RF channel positions and resource elements in different operating bands?","The global frequency raster defines a set of RF reference frequencies (FREF) used to identify the position of RF channels, SS blocks, and other elements across all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The granularity of the global frequency raster is denoted as ΔFGlobal. RF reference frequencies are designated by an NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) within the range [0…3279165]. The relationship between NR-ARFCN and RF reference frequency (FREF) in MHz is given by the equation: FREF = FREF-Offs + ΔFGlobal (NREF – NREF-Offs), where FREF-Offs and NRef-Offs are specified values.

The channel raster is a subset of the global frequency raster and is used to identify the RF channel position in both uplink and downlink. The granularity of the channel raster, ΔFRaster, may be equal to or larger than ΔFGlobal. For each operating band, a subset of frequencies from the global frequency raster forms the channel raster. The mapping between the channel raster and the corresponding resource element is provided in clause 5.4.2.2, and the applicable entries for each operating band are defined in clause 5.4.2.3.

In SAN operating bands, particularly for FR1, the RF channel positions on the channel raster are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN. For bands with a 100 kHz channel raster, ΔFRaster is 20 times ΔFGlobal, meaning every 20th NR-ARFCN within the operating band is applicable for the channel raster, with a step size of 20.

The mapping between the RF reference frequency on the channel raster and the corresponding resource element depends on the total number of Resource Blocks (RBs) allocated in the channel and applies to both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). This mapping must apply to at least one numerology supported by the SAN, as detailed in table 5.4.2.2-1.","The answer should include:
  - The definition and purpose of the global frequency raster and its granularity (ΔFGlobal).
  - Explanation of NR-ARFCN and its range, and the equation relating NR-ARFCN to RF reference frequency.
  - Description of the channel raster, its granularity (ΔFRaster), and how it is derived from the global frequency raster.
  - Specific details on the RF channel positions in SAN operating bands, particularly for FR1, and the step size for the channel raster.
  - The mapping process between the RF reference frequency on the channel raster and the corresponding resource elements, including the role of the number of RBs and its application to both UL and DL."
"Describe the notations and rules for defining procedures, messages, and information elements (IEs) in the SLmAP protocol as specified in TS 36.459.","In the SLmAP protocol as specified in TS 36.459, the following notations and rules apply:

1. **Notations**:
   - **Procedure**: When referring to an elementary procedure, the procedure name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word 'procedure', e.g., E-RAB procedure.
   - **Message**: When referring to a message, the message name is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word 'message', e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
   - **Information Element (IE)**: When referring to an information element, the information element name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in italic font followed by the abbreviation 'IE', e.g., Information Element IE.
   - **Value of an IE**: When referring to the value of an information element, the value is written as specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., 'Value'.

2. **Precedence Rules**:
   - In case of contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition in subclause 9.3, the ASN.1 definition takes precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format takes precedence.

3. **Bitstring Representation**:
   - When specifying information elements represented by bitstrings, the following principles apply:
     - The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB).
     - The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB).
     - When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information.

4. **Constructing SLmAP Messages Using ASN.1**:
   - SLmAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1.
   - IEs shall be ordered in an IE container in the order they appear in object set definitions.
   - Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear:
     - An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value 'mandatory'.
     - An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value 'optional' or 'conditional'.
     - If there is multiplicity specified for an IE in a tabular format, the corresponding ASN.1 definition separates the list definition into two parts: an IE container list and list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own and may contain only one kind of list elements.
   - If a SLmAP message is not constructed as defined, it shall be considered as an Abstract Syntax Error and handled accordingly.

These conventions and rules ensure consistency and clarity in the specification and implementation of the SLmAP protocol.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The notation conventions for procedures, messages, IEs, and values of IEs as specified in Document 1.

What are the requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD and TDD inter frequency cell reselection for Cat-NB1 UE in enhanced coverage as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD and TDD inter frequency cell reselection for Cat-NB1 UE in enhanced coverage are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.521. 

For HD-FDD inter frequency cell reselection, the verification requirements are specified in clause 4.6.2.6. The primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Tables 4.2.24.4.1-1, 4.2.24.5-1, and 4.2.24.5-2. These tables include specific test parameters for Ncell 1, Ncell 2, and Cell 1. The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE camps on Ncell 2 and starts to send preambles on the NPRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Ncell 2. This delay should be less than 66.32 seconds. For an already detected cell, the delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T3 to the moment when the UE camps on Ncell 1 and starts to send preambles on the NPRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Ncell 1. This delay should be less than 21.12 seconds. The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests should be at least 90%.

For TDD inter frequency cell reselection, the primary level settings and test tolerances are defined in Tables 4.2.37.5-1 and 4.2.37.5-2.

For an already detected cell, the delay should be less than 21.12 seconds. The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests should also be at least 90%.

In both cases, the cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell can be expressed as Tdetect,NB_Inter_EC + TSI, and to an already detected cell as Tevaluate, NB_Inter_EC + TSI, where TSI is the maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell, assumed to be 8.32 seconds in these test cases.

Describe the procedures and mechanisms involved in clearing a user's SIP registration and managing active sessions in stateful network elements according to 3GPP TS 23.228.,"The procedures and mechanisms for clearing a user's SIP registration and managing active sessions in stateful network elements according to 3GPP TS 23.228 involve several key steps and components.

Firstly, the need to clear a user's SIP registration can arise due to various reasons such as subscription termination or a lost terminal. The home network administrative function determines this need and initiates the de-registration procedure. This function can reside in different elements depending on the specific reason for de-registration. One such element is the Home Subscriber Server (HSS), which uses the Cx-Deregister to clear the registration. Another element that can initiate de-registration is the Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF), which uses the Cx-Put to inform the HSS. Other trusted or secured parties may also initiate de-registration to the S-CSCF.

The network initiated IM CN subsystem terminal application de-registration is based on administrative actions and does not notify the IP transport infrastructure. If complete packet access needs to be denied, a transport layer administrative mechanism would be used. This scenario specifically addresses the action of clearing the SIP application registration currently in effect and does not cover administrative mechanisms for updating subscriber records, EIR records, or access authorization. Ongoing sessions may be released using network initiated session release procedures.

Additionally, active sessions in stateful network elements such as CSCFs and Application Servers (ASs) need to be refreshed periodically. This SIP-level session refreshing mechanism helps detect and free resources used by hanging sessions due to unexpected errors like loss of radio coverage or application crashes in the User Equipment (UE). The refreshing period typically ranges from several tens of minutes to hours. This mechanism complements the network initiated session release procedures. The use of the session refresh mechanism for a particular session is negotiated between the endpoints upon session initiation.

IMS entities acting as User Agents, as defined in IETF RFC 3261, should support the session refresh mechanism. This includes the negotiation of session refresh details upon session initiation and the initiation of session refresh requests.

In summary, the procedures for clearing a user's SIP registration involve specific elements and actions, while managing active sessions in stateful network elements requires periodic refreshing and negotiation of session details to ensure efficient resource management.","Key details the answer must include:
                        - Explanation of the reasons for clearing a user's SIP registration.
                        - Description of the elements involved in initiating de-registration and their respective roles (HSS, S-CSCF, other trusted parties).
                        - Detailed procedure of using Cx-Deregister and Cx-Put for de-registration.
                        - Overview of network initiated IM CN subsystem terminal application de-registration and its scope.

"Explain the role and operation of Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) in PS to CS calls, particularly focusing on the handling of EVS-CA frames and the use_partial_copy signalling bit.","Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) plays a crucial role in PS to CS calls by ensuring that speech frames are delivered in a timely and orderly manner, despite the inherent jitter in packet-switched (PS) networks. In PS networks, speech frames can experience varying delays and may arrive out of order, necessitating the use of de-jitter buffers to manage this variability. However, in circuit-switched (CS) networks, the jitter is minimal, and 3G-UEs typically do not deploy de-jitter buffers.

In PS to CS calls, the Media Gateway (MGW) is responsible for removing the PS uplink jitter before sending the Enhanced Voice Services Channel Aware (EVS-CA) frames over the Iu interface to the CS network. This process involves reordering and de-jittering the speech frames within the MGW, which acts as the JBM for the 3G-UE. The MGW ensures that well-received, reordered, and de-jittered speech frames are forwarded to the Iu interface and subsequently to the 3G-UE decoder every 20 ms.

The EVS-CA mode includes a source-controlled partial-redundant copy in-band, which is transmitted along with the primary encoding of a future frame (N+K). The offset parameter, K, determines the separation between the primary and redundant frame. If a frame (N) is lost in the PS network, the MGW can inspect the jitter buffer for the availability of frame (N+K) and send it to the 3G-UE as a partial-redundant copy.

The use_partial_copy signalling bit is crucial for conveying decoding information to the 3G-UE. When the 3G-UE receives the 13.2 kbps EVS-CA frame, it needs to know whether to use the primary portion or the partial-redundant copy for decoding. If the use_partial_copy signalling bit is set to 1, the 3G-UE will decode the redundant part of the EVS-CA frame immediately, without additional delay, and save it in a buffer to improve performance in case of CS-downlink loss. If the signalling bit is set to 0, the primary frame is decoded, and the redundant part is ignored.

In cases where the partial-redundant copy is not available, the 3G-UE may perform concealment to handle frame loss. The MGW must also handle corner cases where a call is transferred from a PS domain to a CS domain, ensuring that the stream of speech frames remains consistent after the first JBM.

Overall, JBM in the MGW is essential for enabling PS to CS calls by managing jitter, reordering frames, and providing necessary decoding information through the use_partial_copy signalling bit.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The necessity of removing PS uplink jitter in MGW before sending frames to CS networks.
- The operation of EVS-CA mode, including the encoding and transmission of partial-redundant copies.
- The role of JBM in the Iu-terminating MGW and its function in reordering and de-jittering speech frames.
- The use of the use_partial_copy signalling bit to indicate whether the primary or partial-redundant copy should be used for decoding in 3G-UE.
- Handling of frame loss and the process of concealment in the absence of partial-redundant copies."
What are the requirements and conditions for measurements on intra-frequency NR cells for stationary RedCap UEs as defined in TS 38.533 and TS 38.304?,"The requirements and conditions for measurements on intra-frequency NR cells for stationary RedCap UEs are detailed in TS 38.533 and TS 38.304. According to TS 38.533, measurements are required when Srxlev ≤ SIntraSearchP or Squal ≤ SIntraSearchQ, and the UE is configured with any of the following relaxed measurement criteria: 
- Relaxed measurement criterion for a stationary UE defined in clause 5.2.4.9.3 in TS 38.304,
- Relaxed measurement criterion for a stationary UE not at cell edge defined in clause 5.2.4.9.4 in TS 38.304,
- Both low mobility criterion and stationary criterion as defined in clause 5.2.4.9.1 and 5.2.4.9.3 or 5.2.4.9.4 in TS 38.304 respectively.

For the evaluation of one or more relaxed measurement criteria, the following values are applied:
- s-SearchDeltaP-r16: signalled value - 1 dB,
- s-SearchDeltaP-Stationary-r17: signalled value - 1 dB,
- s-SearchThresholdP-r16: signalled value + 1 dB,
- s-SearchThresholdQ-r16: signalled value + 1 dB,
- s-SearchThresholdP2-r17: signalled value + 1 dB,
- s-SearchThresholdQ2-r17: signalled value + 1 dB.

The UE must be configured with stationaryMobilityEvaluation criterion and fulfill that criterion, or be configured with both stationaryMobilityEvaluation and cellEdgeEvaluationWhileStationary criteria, and combineRelaxedMeasCondition2 not configured, fulfilling only the stationaryMobilityEvaluation criterion.

Specific requirements for detection, measurement, and evaluation times (Tdetect, Tmeasure, Tevaluate) are provided in tables for 1 Rx and 2 Rx RedCap UEs, and for UEs configured with eDRX_IDLE cycle up to 10.24 s in FR1 and FR2. For eDRX_IDLE cycles greater than 10.24 s, requirements are provided for cycles up to 163.84 s, ensuring the evaluation/measurement time with relaxation on one carrier does not exceed the single PTW window length.

According to TS 38.304, the relaxed measurement criterion for a stationary RedCap UE is fulfilled when (SrxlevRefStationary – Srxlev) < SSearchDeltaP-Stationary. The SrxlevRefStationary value is set to the current Srxlev value of the serving cell after selecting or reselecting a new cell, if (Srxlev - SrxlevRefStationary) > 0, or if the relaxed measurement criterion has not been met for TSearchDeltaP-Stationary.","The answer should cover the specific conditions under which measurements on intra-frequency NR cells are required for stationary RedCap UEs, including the relaxed measurement criteria and the specific values for s-SearchDeltaP, s-SearchThresholdP, and s-SearchThresholdQ.

"How does the NWDAF service consumer obtain QoS sustainability analytics from the NWDAF, and what are the key steps involved in the process?","The NWDAF service consumer, which could be a network function (NF), operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM), or an application function (AF), can obtain QoS sustainability analytics from the NWDAF by following a series of steps. 

Firstly, the service consumer may invoke the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operation by sending an HTTP GET request targeting the resource 'NWDAF Analytics'. This request includes the analytics identifier and related event filter information. If the request is accepted, the NWDAF responds with the requested analytics information and a '200 OK' status.

Alternatively, the service consumer can subscribe to the analytics information by invoking the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operation. This involves sending an HTTP POST request targeting the resource 'NWDAF Events Subscriptions', which includes the subscribed events and possibly event filter information. If the subscription is accepted, the NWDAF responds with '201 Created' and provides the URI of the created subscription. The service consumer can also update an existing subscription by sending an HTTP PUT request with the resource URI of the 'Individual NWDAF Event Subscription'. If the update is accepted, the NWDAF responds with '200 OK' or '204 No Content'.

Once subscribed, if the NWDAF observes the subscribed events, it invokes the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation to report the events by sending an HTTP POST request with the notification URI. The service consumer then responds with '204 No Content'. To unsubscribe, the service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request targeting the resource 'Individual NWDAF Event Subscription', including the event subscription ID of the existing subscription to be deleted. If the unsubscription is accepted, the NWDAF responds with '204 No Content'.

During this process, the NWDAF may collect necessary data from the OAM, such as RAN UE Throughput and QoS flow Retainability information. The NWDAF then calculates the QoS sustainability analytics based on the collected data.

For detailed descriptions of the service operations, refer to the relevant 3GPP TS documents.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The initial steps for invoking Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request and Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operations.

"How does the Multicall supplementary service manage terminating and originating CS calls in a mobile terminal, considering the maximum number of bearers and calls, and the interaction with Call Hold and Call Waiting supplementary services?","The Multicall supplementary service handles terminating and originating CS calls in a mobile terminal by managing the indication and establishment of calls based on the maximum number of bearers (Nbr) and CS mobile terminating calls (Ncs_MT).

For terminating CS calls:
- The indication of a terminating CS call is done by the Multicall supplementary service until either the maximum number of bearers (Nbr) or the maximum number of CS mobile terminating calls (Ncs_MT) is reached.
- If the maximum number of terminating calls (Ncs_MT) is reached, additional terminating calls are rejected without any indication to the subscriber.
- If the maximum number of bearers (Nbr) is reached, an additional terminating call is indicated to the user only if the Call Waiting supplementary service is active.
- If neither Nbr nor Ncs_MT have been reached, the user can accept, reject, or ignore the terminating call. Accepting the call allows the user to allocate a new bearer or reuse/share an existing bearer if Call Hold SS is active. Rejecting the call releases it normally, while ignoring the call leads to normal call handling procedures, such as releasing the call after the Alerting Timer expires.
- If there is a terminating speech call attempt during an ongoing speech call, the terminating call is not indicated to the user by the Multicall service, and the Call Waiting SS is invoked if applicable.

For originating CS calls:
- If neither Nbr nor Ncs_MO have been reached, the user can establish a new originating CS call by allocating a new bearer or reusing/sharing an already established bearer if Call Hold SS is active.
- The mobile terminal is restricted from originating a speech call requesting a new bearer when there is already an active speech call.

Overall, the Multicall supplementary service ensures efficient call management by interacting with Call Hold and Call Waiting supplementary services, allowing users to handle multiple calls effectively within the constraints of maximum bearers and calls.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how the Multicall supplementary service indicates terminating CS calls and the conditions under which calls are accepted, rejected, or ignored.
  - Description of the conditions when the maximum number of bearers (Nbr) or CS mobile terminating calls (Ncs_MT) is reached and the resulting actions.
  - User options for handling terminating calls, including interaction with Call Waiting and Call Hold supplementary services.
  - Explanation of how new originating CS calls are handled, including the conditions for allocating new bearers or reusing/sharing established bearers.

"Explain the traffic reduction mechanisms in the MSC and BSS as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, including the role of timers and the handling of overload messages.","The traffic reduction mechanisms in the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) and BSS (Base Station Subsystem) as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 involve several key processes and components:

1. **Step-by-Step Traffic Reduction Algorithm**: 
   - Upon receiving the first OVERLOAD message or signalling point congested information, the traffic is reduced by one step, and timers T5 (T17) and T6 (T18) are started. During T5 (T17), any additional overload messages are ignored to prevent rapid traffic reduction. If an OVERLOAD message is received after T5 (T17) but during T6 (T18), the traffic load is reduced by another step, and both timers are restarted. This process continues until the maximum reduction is achieved. If T6 (T18) expires without receiving any overload messages, the traffic is increased by one step, and T6 (T18) is restarted unless full load has been resumed. Timers T5 and T6 operate in the MSC, while T17 and T18 operate in the BSS.

2. **MSC Indication of Congestion to BSS**:
   - The MSC can indicate its congested state to the BSS by sending an OVERLOAD message, which is a connectionless global message. Upon receiving this message, the BSS reduces random access traffic using the method described in sub-clause 3.1.12.1. For instance, the random access traffic can be reduced by utilizing the access control class in the system information message.

3. **BSS Indication of Congestion to MSC**:
   - If the CCCH (Common Control Channel) scheduler at the BSS is overloaded, the BSS sends an OVERLOAD message to the MSC with the cause value ","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The step-by-step traffic reduction algorithm in the MSC and BSS, including the role and operation of timers T5/T6 and T17/T18.
  - How the MSC indicates congestion to the BSS and the subsequent reduction of random access traffic using access control class.
  - The process by which the BSS indicates congestion to the MSC, including the cause values for different types of overload.
  - The handling of congestion in lower protocol layers and the role of MTP congestion indication in reducing generated load."

For the connection setup, the SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources are connected to the UE antenna connectors. For UEs supporting only 2Rx in all the bands under test, the setup uses TS 36.508 Annex A, Figure group A.41 as appropriate. For UEs supporting 4Rx in any of the bands under test, the setup uses TS 36.508 Annex A, Figure A.90, without a neighbor on Pcell. The 2Rx module is used for cells on bands supporting 2Rx, and the 4Rx module is used for cells on bands supporting 4Rx. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0.

For enhanced performance requirements type A and type B, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is also based on a single carrier. It is defined as the ratio of the total signal energy of one intra-cell user equipment (UE) in the subframe on a single antenna port to the summation of the received energy of the strongest inter-cell interferers plus the white noise energy (N) in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the duration of a subframe on a single antenna port.

"Describe the roles and responsibilities of the MCData server and MC gateway server in the MCData system, and explain the functionality of the ProSe 5G UE-to-Network Relay entity.","The MCData server in the MCData system has distinct roles and responsibilities depending on whether it is in a controlling or participating role. In the controlling role, the MCData server is responsible for handling transmission and reception control, interfacing with the group management server for group policy and affiliation status information, managing SDS and FD data distribution during group communication, and managing the MCData transport service for IP connectivity. In the participating role, the MCData server handles transmission control, supports group affiliation for MCData users, interfaces with the group management server, relays communication messages between the MCData client and the controlling MCData server, and handles reception control for its users.

The MC gateway server provides support for MCData interconnection services with a partner MCData system in a different trust domain while providing topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCData servers in the partner MCData system without exposing the MCData servers in the primary MCData system outside its trusted domain. The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and transmission control signalling messages, as well as media, between MCData servers within the MCData system and the interconnected MCData system.

The ProSe 5G UE-to-Network Relay entity supports connectivity to the network for Remote UEs. It can be used for both public safety and commercial services. A Remote UE establishes a PC5 link to the ProSe 5G UE-to-Network Relay, which can relay unicast traffic between the Remote UE and the network. The relay can handle IP, Ethernet, or Unstructured traffic over the PC5 reference point and determines the PDU Session Type based on ProSe policy, URSP rule, Relay Service Code, and other parameters.

For CFU, the deactivation can be performed in three ways:
1. The subscriber can specifically deactivate a previous activation with an appropriate control procedure.
2. The subscriber can register information for CFU, causing previous registrations and activations to be overridden.
3. The service is deactivated as a result of the withdrawal of the supplementary service.

The deactivation request may specify a basic service group for which deactivation is required. If no basic service group code is provided, the deactivation applies to all basic services for which CFU is active. The user receives a notification of acceptance or rejection of the deactivation request. The information flow for CFU deactivation is shown in figure 1.7.

For CFB, CFNRy, and CFNRc, the same deactivation rules apply as described for CFU. The information flow diagrams for these services are similar, with specific figures provided for each:
- CFB deactivation is shown in figure 2.7.
- CFNRy deactivation is shown in figure 3.7.
- CFNRc deactivation is shown in figure 4.7.

In all cases, the deactivation process involves the Mobile Station (MS), Mobile Switching Center (MSC), Visitor Location Register (VLR), and Home Location Register (HLR). The process includes sending a deactivation request from the MS to the MSC, which then forwards it to the VLR and HLR. The HLR acknowledges the deactivation, and the acknowledgment is sent back through the VLR and MSC to the MS, completing the deactivation process.","The answer must include the deactivation methods common to all call forwarding services (CFU, CFB, CFNRy, CFNRc), the handling of basic service group codes, the interaction with other supplementary services, and the specific information flow diagrams for each type of call forwarding service.

What are the key requirements for operating band unwanted emission limits and GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band Category 2 for an MSR Base Station?,"The key requirements for operating band unwanted emission limits for an MSR Base Station are defined from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge located at FBW RF,low, and from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge located at FBW RF,high up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. The values of ΔfOBUE are specified in table 6.6-1. These requirements apply to all types of transmitters and transmission modes as specified by the manufacturer, except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. For multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply, and the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter-RF Bandwidth gap is not applicable.

For GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band Category 2, specific requirements from TS 45.005 apply to an MSR Base Station. These include:

Most of the sub-blocks used in the decoder are also needed in the encoder, with the addition of the short term synthesis filter and the de-emphasis filter as new sub-blocks.

1. **RPE Decoding (Clause 3.2.1)**: The input signal for the long term synthesis filter is formed by decoding and denormalizing the RPE-samples through APCM inverse quantization and placing them in the correct time position using RPE grid positioning. The sampling frequency is increased by a factor of 3 by inserting intermediate zero-valued samples.

2. **Long Term Prediction (Clause 3.2.2)**: The reconstructed long term residual signal (er') is applied to the long term synthesis filter, which produces the reconstructed short term residual signal (dr') for the short term synthesizer.

3. **Short Term Synthesis Filtering (Clause 3.2.3)**: The coefficients of the short term synthesis filter are reconstructed using the same procedure as in the encoder. The short term synthesis filter is implemented according to the lattice structure, with the following equations:
   - sr(0)(k) = dr'(k)
   - sr(i)(k) = sr(i-1)(k) - rr'(9-i) * v8-i(k-1); i=1,...,8

What are the in-channel selectivity requirements for E-UTRA and NB-IoT as specified in the 3GPP documents?,"In-channel selectivity (ICS) is defined as the receiver's ability to receive a desired signal at its assigned resource block locations despite the presence of an interfering signal with a higher power spectral density. This condition requires meeting a throughput requirement for a specified reference measurement channel.

Describe the measurement requirements and capabilities for UE in different states when performing E-UTRAN and GSM measurements according to 3GPP TS 25.133.,"According to 3GPP TS 25.133, the measurement requirements and capabilities for User Equipment (UE) when performing E-UTRAN and GSM measurements vary depending on the state of the UE and the type of measurements being performed.

For E-UTRAN measurements, when compressed mode gaps are scheduled, the UE physical layer must report measurements to higher layers with the accuracy specified in sub-clauses 9.1.4a and 9.1.4b. The measurement period for normal performance is defined as TMeasurement_Period_E-UTRAN = 480 x Kn x Nfreq,E-UTRA,n ms, and for reduced performance as TMeasurement_Period_E-UTRAN = 480 x Kr x Nfreq,E-UTRA,r ms. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements for at least 4 E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency, based on its supported capabilities. Additionally, for UEs supporting E-UTRA measurements in the Cell-DCH state, they must monitor a minimum of 13 carrier frequency layers, which can include combinations of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, and GSM layers.

For GSM measurements, the requirements differ based on whether the UE is in the CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH state. In the CELL_DCH state, if compressed mode is not needed, the measurement accuracy requirements for RXLEV as specified in TS 45.008 apply. If compressed mode is needed, the GSM measurement procedure and accuracy requirements stated in section 8.1.2.5 apply. Similarly, in the CELL_FACH state, if measurement occasions are not needed, the RXLEV accuracy requirements in TS 45.008 apply. If measurement occasions are needed, the GSM measurement procedure and accuracy requirements in section 8.4.2.5 apply. The reporting range and mapping for RXLEV specified in TS 45.008 also apply.

When a measurement occasion cycle is scheduled for E-UTRA measurements, the UE physical layer must report measurements with the accuracy specified in sub-clauses 9.1.4a/b. The measurement period for normal performance is given by Tbasic_measurement_E-UTRAN = 60 ms, and if measurement occasions are not needed, the period is 480 ms. The specific parameters such as NE-UTRA,n, NE-UTRA,r, Kn, Kr, and TE-UTRAN FACH are detailed in section 8.4.2.6.1.

In summary, the UE must meet specific measurement accuracy requirements and periods for both E-UTRAN and GSM measurements, depending on its state and whether compressed mode or measurement occasions are required. The UE must also support a minimum number of carrier frequency layers and perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements as per its capabilities.","The answer should include the measurement accuracy requirements for E-UTRAN and GSM measurements, the specific measurement periods for different UE states (CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH), the conditions under which compressed mode or measurement occasions are needed, the capabilities of the UE in terms of RSRP and RSRQ measurements, and the minimum number of carrier frequency layers the UE must monitor.

- Rating considering cross-product, cross-channel, counter-based, rental-based, and recharge-based discounts, benefits, and allowances.
- Handling various rateable instances, including volume, time, and events.
- Determination of the tariff or price of chargeable events or multiple chargeable events.
- Evaluation of rate requests, which include various rating parameters such as service identifier, subscriber reference, network identification, user location, service usage time, and transferred data volume.

Each Temporary Logical Link Identifier (TLLI) can have multiple LLEs, and each LLE provides several functions, including unacknowledged information transfer, acknowledged information transfer, flow control in Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM) operation, frame error detection, and integrity protection in unacknowledged information transfer. The LLEs analyze the control field of received frames and provide appropriate responses and layer-to-layer indications. They also analyze the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer service primitives and transmit the appropriate command and response frames. There is one logical link entity for each Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI).

Describe the functional and performance requirements for Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) in MTSI clients as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114.,"The functional and performance requirements for Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) in MTSI clients as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114 are comprehensive and ensure effective management of jitter to maintain speech quality. 

Functional requirements for speech JBM in MTSI clients include:
- Support for both source-controlled rate operation and non-source-controlled rate operation.
- The ability to receive de-packetized frames out of order and present them in order for decoder consumption.
- The capability to receive duplicate speech frames and only present unique speech frames for decoder consumption.
- Management of clock drift between the encoding and decoding end-points.

Performance requirements for JBM in MTSI clients involve jitter-induced concealment operations, which include:
- Removal of a speech frame due to buffer overflow or intentional frame dropping during buffer depth adaptation.
- Deletion of a speech frame that arrives too late at the JBM.
- Modification of the output timeline due to link loss.
- Insertion of a speech frame controlled by the JBM in cases of buffer underflow.

The jitter loss rate, calculated as the number of JBM-triggered concealed frames divided by the number of transmitted frames, should be below 1% for every channel measured over the full length of the respective channel. This threshold ensures that the speech quality is not significantly reduced.

For MTSI clients using fixed access, the JBM must handle delay jitter to minimize speech quality degradation while limiting additional end-to-end delay due to jitter buffering time. The JBM must comply with the functional requirements defined in clause 8.2.2 and the minimum performance requirements defined in clause 8.2.3. Additionally, the JBM should be capable of handling the delay and error profiles derived for mobile access to support end-to-end fixed-mobile interworking, as jitter and packet loss characteristics can vary across different network types and combinations.","The answer should cover the functional requirements for JBM in MTSI clients, including handling of out-of-order and duplicate frames, clock drift management, and support for different rate operations. It should also detail the performance requirements, including jitter-induced concealment operations, calculation of jitter loss rate, and acceptable thresholds. Additionally, the answer should address the handling of delay jitter in fixed access scenarios and the need for JBM to support fixed-mobile interworking."

   - The source BSS initiates a PS handover and sends a PS Handover Required message to the SGSN.
   - The SGSN constructs a Relocation Request message and sends it to the target GANC.
   - GAN PTCs are activated between the MS and GANC, and the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS enters the PTC-ACTIVE substate.
   - The GANC sends the Relocation Request Acknowledge message to the SGSN, completing the preparation phase.

3. **UTRAN to GAN PS Handover (Document 4, TS 43.318 9.23.2.1):**
   - Assumptions include active PDP Contexts with active RABs in UTRAN, successful registration with GANC, operation in GAN Iu mode, and matching neighbouring cells.

What are the requirements for CSI-RS resource evaluation in IAB-MT as specified in 3GPP TS 38.174?,"The requirements for CSI-RS resource evaluation in IAB-MT as specified in 3GPP TS 38.174 include several key aspects:

1. **Configuration and Transmission**: CSI-RS resources must be configured and transmitted within the IAB MT active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period. This ensures that the CSI-RS resources are available for candidate beam detection.

2. **Evaluation Criteria for L1-RSRP**: Upon request, the IAB-MT must be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP measured on the configured CSI-RS resource becomes better than the threshold Qin_LR within the specified evaluation period (TEvaluate_CBD_CSI-RS). The evaluation period varies depending on the frequency range (FR1 or FR2) and is defined in tables 12.3.2.6.2-1 and 12.3.2.6.2-2.

3. **Impact of Candidate Beam Detection RS Overlapping with SMTC Occasions**: The evaluation period is affected by whether the candidate beam detection RS overlaps with SMTC occasions. For FR2-1:
   - P = 1 when there is no overlap.
   - P = 3 when there is full overlap.
   - The evaluation period is adjusted accordingly if the IAB-MT is capable of handling multiple SMTC configurations per frequency.

4. **Applicability of UE Requirements**: The UE requirements specified in sub-clause 8.5.6.3 are applicable to IAB-MT. This means that the IAB-MT must adhere to the same standards and criteria as defined for UE in the relevant sub-clause.

Overall, these requirements ensure that the IAB-MT can effectively evaluate CSI-RS resources for candidate beam detection, taking into account various factors such as transmission configuration, evaluation periods, and overlapping occasions.","The answer should include the following key details:
- The conditions under which CSI-RS resources must be configured and transmitted within the IAB MT active DL BWP.
- The evaluation criteria for L1-RSRP on CSI-RS resources, including the specific evaluation periods (TEvaluate_CBD_CSI-RS) for FR1 and FR2.
- The impact of candidate beam detection RS overlapping with SMTC occasions on the evaluation period.
- The applicability of UE requirements from sub-clause 8.5.6.3 to IAB-MT."

The frequencies to be tested are outlined in Annex E table E-1 and clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1 of 3GPP TS 36.508. The channel bandwidth to be tested is 10 MHz, as defined in clause 4.3.1 of the same document.

The setup involves connecting the SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connectors, as illustrated in Annex A Figure A.14 of 3GPP TS 36.508. General test parameter settings are established according to Table 8.25.2.4-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clauses B.0. The message contents are defined in clause 8.25.2.4.3.

During the tests, there are two cells: cell1 (E-UTRAN TDD) and cell2 (WLAN AP). The UE is informed through measurement control information that event-triggered reporting with Events W1 (for cell2) and W3 (for cell2) will be used. The test consists of three successive time periods, T1, T2, and T3. During T1, the UE has no information on cell2. At the beginning of T2, the transmission power of cell2 is increased to a level that triggers Event W1 reporting. At the beginning of T3, the transmission power of cell2 is decreased to a level that triggers Event W3 reporting.

Describe the test procedure and requirements for verifying inter-RAT E-UTRAN RS-SINR absolute measurement accuracy when the serving cell is NR FR1 and the target cell is E-UTRA.,"The purpose of the test is to verify that the inter-RAT E-UTRAN RS-SINR absolute measurement accuracy is within the specified limits for all bands, when the serving cell is NR FR1 and the target cell is E-UTRA. This test applies to all types of NR UE from Release 15 onwards supporting E-UTRA and rs-SINR-MeasEUTRA. The minimum conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 clause A.6.7.7.1.

Initial conditions for the test include configuring the test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) according to specified parameters. The test shall be conducted using any of the test configurations in Table 6.7.7.1.4.1-1, with NR Cell 1 as the NR PCell on the NR carrier and Cell 2 as the E-UTRA neighbor cell on the E-UTRA carrier, which is the target for the measurements.

The test procedure involves several steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters Connectivity NR, Connected without release On, and Test Mode On.
2. Set the parameters according to the appropriate tables.
3. The SS shall transmit an RRCReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. The UE shall transmit an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE shall periodically transmit MeasurementReport messages.
6. After a 10-second wait from Step 3, the SS shall check the RS-SINR reported values in the periodic MeasurementReport. The RS-SINR value of Cell 2 reported by the UE is compared to the expected RS-SINR. If the value is outside the specified limits or the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 2, the number of failed iterations is increased by one. Otherwise, the number of passed iterations is increased by one.
7. The SS shall continue checking the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level according to Table G.2.3-1 in Annex G is achieved.
8. Set the parameters according to each sub-test and repeat steps 5-7.

Message contents are defined according to TS 38.508-1 clause 7.3 with specific exceptions listed in the test documentation.

Test requirements include primary level settings and test tolerances for all tests. Each SS-RSRP measurement report must meet the corresponding absolute accuracy requirements. For the test to pass, the ratio of successful reported values in each test must be more than 90% with a confidence level of 95%.

The measurement period of E-UTRA RS-SINR in RRC_CONNECTED state is specified in TS 38.133 clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

What are the requirements for FDD RSRP measurements and reference sensitivity power levels as defined in the 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.101 documents?,"The requirements for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements and reference sensitivity power levels are detailed in the 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.101 documents.

For FDD RSRP measurements, the intra frequency absolute accuracy requirements must be met as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.1. These measurements are valid under specific conditions, including the transmission of cell-specific reference signals from one, two, or four antenna ports, and the fulfillment of reference sensitivity conditions as outlined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3. The reporting range for RSRP is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with a resolution of 1 dB.

"Describe the procedures and rules for setting and adjusting cell power levels in a test case involving multiple E-UTRA cells, as specified in TS 36.523.","In a test case involving multiple E-UTRA cells, the procedures and rules for setting and adjusting cell power levels are detailed in TS 36.523. Initially, the Reference Power field is set when the cell is created and is not updated during the test case execution. The System Simulator (SS) applies the Reference Power when the cell is fully configured. To adjust the power level during the test case, the Attenuation field is used. After the initial configuration of a cell, the attenuation corresponds to the value 'off'. When changing the power for more than one cell, the changes must occur simultaneously for all cells according to the specified time instances for power level changes. The maximum time to complete the power change for all cells is 700 ms when changing the power from 'off' to a certain value, or 100 ms (10 frames) otherwise. The SS must ensure that the power level at the test ports conforms to the required downlink signal levels.

Additionally, when there is more than one E-UTRA cell in a test case, the following rules are applied in TTCN: at the beginning of the preamble, before the initial attachment of the UE, all E-UTRA cells are configured but switched off. During the preamble, only the serving cell is switched on, while all other cells remain switched off. At the end of the preamble, the cells are configured according to the initial power level settings of the test case. The mapping of cells to physical resources and the management of these resources are outside the scope of TTCN. Cells that are switched off do not need to be mapped to physical resources, but when a cell is switched on, it can either already be mapped to a physical resource or needs to be mapped to a free resource. If there are fewer physical resources than cells, the SS implementation must find strategies to dynamically map the cells to the resources. Regardless of the strategies used, the SS must adhere to the timing restrictions for changing power levels of one or several cells as stated in clause 7.4.2.","The answer must include details on how Reference Power and Attenuation fields are used to set and adjust cell power levels, the initial configuration of cells, the rules for simultaneous power changes, the maximum time allowed for power changes, and the required downlink signal levels.

"Describe the requirements and testing procedures for ensuring system functions are not used without successful authentication and authorization, and for ensuring accounts allow unambiguous identification of users as per 3GPP TS 33.117.","The requirements for ensuring system functions are not used without successful authentication and authorization, and for ensuring accounts allow unambiguous identification of users, are detailed in 3GPP TS 33.117.

Firstly, system functions must not be used or accessed without successful authentication and authorization. This means that any usage of a system function must be prevented unless the user has successfully authenticated their identity using at least one authentication attribute, such as a password or certificate. System functions include network services like SSH, SFTP, Web services, local access via a management console, and local usage of operating systems and applications. An exception to this requirement is functions for public use, such as those provided by a Web server on the Internet for public information access.

To verify this requirement, the test case TC_SYS_FUN_USAGE is used. The pre-conditions include the manufacturer supplying a list of system functions and access entries. The execution steps involve the tester verifying the adequacy of the list and ensuring that access entries require successful authentication and authorization. The expected result is that the network product does not allow access to any system function without successful user authentication and authorization. Evidence of the test results is provided in a testing report that includes descriptions of executed tests, relevant output, and the test result.

Secondly, accounts must allow unambiguous identification of users. This means that users must be identified individually by the network product, which should support individual accounts per user, whether the user is a person, an application, or a system. The network product should not enable the use of group accounts or group credentials by default and should support a minimum of 50 individual accounts per user database to ensure accountability in large operator networks. The network product should not support user access credentials unrelated to an account.

To verify this requirement, several test cases are used:
- TC_ACCOUNT_DOCUMENTATION ensures that the documentation does not encourage or require the use of group accounts or credentials unrelated to an account.
- TC_ACCOUNT_DEFAULTS ensures that the default setup of the network product does not enable the use of group accounts or group credentials.
- TC_ACCOUNT_NUMBER ensures that the network product supports the minimum number of individual accounts per user database.

The pre-conditions for these test cases include identifying all user and group databases and predefined accounts in the documentation. The execution steps involve reviewing the documentation and databases, and creating accounts until the minimum number is reached. The expected results are that the documentation is in line with the requirements, no group credentials are defined, and the minimum number of accounts is successfully created. Evidence of the test results is provided in test reports listing the reviewed documentation, databases, and findings.

Additionally, TS 33.326 confirms that there are no additional requirements or modifications to clause 4.2.3.4.1 from TS 33.117.","Key details the answer must include:

"What are the key performance measurements related to inter-gNB conditional handovers as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552, and how are they measured and utilized?","The key performance measurements related to inter-gNB conditional handovers as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 include the following:

1. **Number of Successful Conditional Handover Executions**:
   - This measurement provides the number of successful conditional handover executions received by the source gNB.

   - The measurement is represented as a single integer value and is identified by MM.ChoExeInterSucc.
   - It is valid for packet switched traffic and is used for performance assurance.

2. **Mean Time of Inter-gNB Conditional Handover Executions**:
   - This measurement provides the mean time of inter-gNB conditional handover executions during each granularity period, split into subcounters per S-NSSAI.
   - The mean time is calculated by accumulating the time interval for every successful inter-gNB handover execution procedure per S-NSSAI between the receipt of UE CONTEXT RELEASE and HANDOVER SUCCESS messages over a granularity period.

3. **Max Time of Inter-gNB Conditional Handover Executions**:
   - This measurement provides the max time of inter-gNB conditional handover executions during each granularity period, split into subcounters per S-NSSAI.
   - The max time is measured by recording the highest time interval for successful inter-gNB handover execution procedures per S-NSSAI between the receipt of UE CONTEXT RELEASE and HANDOVER SUCCESS messages over a granularity period. The highest value is stored in a gauge, which is reinitialized at the beginning of each granularity period.
   - The measurement is represented as an integer value in milliseconds and is identified by MM.ChoExeInterReq.TimeMax.SNSSAI.

Describe the concept and procedures of MM connection as introduced in TS 24.008 4.5.,"The concept of MM (Mobility Management) connection, as introduced in TS 24.008 4.5, serves primarily as a descriptive tool for managing connections within a mobile network. An MM connection can be established by the network either locally, through the transmission of the first CM (Connection Management) layer message without any MM layer messages, or by sending a CM SERVICE PROMPT message, such as in the case of certain ring back services. The release of an MM connection by the network or the mobile station is always local and does not require sending MM messages over the radio interface. However, the establishment of an MM connection by the mobile station does require sending MM messages over the radio interface, with the exception of VGCS (Voice Group Call Service), where an MM connection is established as a result of an uplink access procedure.

The MM sublayer provides connection management services to various entities of the upper CM sublayer. It allows a CM entity to use an MM connection to exchange information with its peer entity. An MM connection is established and released upon request from a CM entity, and different CM entities use different MM connections to communicate with their respective peer entities. Multiple MM connections can be active simultaneously, but they all share the same RR (Radio Resource) connection for a given mobile station.

The procedures for establishing, re-establishing, maintaining, and releasing an MM connection are detailed in the subsequent subclauses of TS 24.008 4.5, typically described separately for the mobile station and the network side. These procedures ensure that the MM connection is managed efficiently to support the communication needs of the CM entities.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of the MM connection concept, how it is established and released by both the network and mobile station, the role of the MM sublayer in providing connection management services, the interaction between MM and CM entities, and the necessity of an RR connection for MM connections. It should also cover the procedures for establishing, re-establishing, maintaining, and releasing an MM connection."
"Describe the procedure for terminating an MBS Policy Association initiated by the AF, including the interactions between AF/NEF/MBSF, PCF, MB-SMF, and BSF, and the relevant HTTP requests and responses.","The procedure for terminating an MBS Policy Association initiated by the AF involves several steps and interactions between different network functions. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Initial Decision and Interaction with PCF**: When the AF decides to terminate an existing MBS Session under policy control, it interacts with the PCF if it was involved during the MBS Policy Association creation. If the PCF was contacted during the creation, the AF/NEF/MBSF sends an HTTP DELETE request to the PCF using the Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization_Delete Request targeting the 'Individual MBS Application Session Context' resource. Upon successful deletion, the PCF responds with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code.

2. **Interaction with MB-SMF**: The AF/NEF/MBSF then sends an Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Delete Request to the MB-SMF. The MB-SMF, in turn, sends an HTTP DELETE request to the PCF targeting the 'Individual MBS Policy' resource to request the deletion of the MBS related policy context. The PCF responds with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code upon successful deletion.

3. **Conditions for Invoking Nbsf_Management_Deregister**: If the same PCF is used for location-dependent MBS sessions and this is the last MBS Policy Association related to that MBS Session, the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Deregister service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the BSF to delete binding information. The BSF responds with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code and removes the stored binding information.

4. **Parallel Execution and Final Response**: Steps 6 and 8 can be executed in parallel. After deleting the concerned MBS Policy Association context, the PCF responds to the MB-SMF with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code. Finally, the MB-SMF sends an Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Delete Response to the NEF/MBSF.

5. **Error Handling**: If errors occur during the processing of the HTTP DELETE request, the PCF applies the error handling procedures specified in the relevant clauses. If the targeted 'Individual MBS Policy' resource does not exist, the PCF rejects the request with an HTTP '404 Not Found' status code, including the ProblemDetails data structure with the 'cause' attribute set to 'MBS_POLICY_ASSOCIATION_NOT_FOUND'.

This procedure ensures the proper termination of the MBS Policy Association and the release of associated resources, following the specified interactions and HTTP request/response protocols.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The initial decision by the AF to terminate the MBS session and the subsequent interaction with the PCF.
- The invocation of the Npcf_MBSPolicyAuthorization_Delete Request and the expected HTTP response.
- The steps involving the MB-SMF, including the Nmbsmf_MBSSession_Delete Request and the interaction with the PCF for deleting the MBS Policy Association.
- The conditions under which the PCF invokes the Nbsf_Management_Deregister service operation and the expected HTTP response.
- The parallel execution of steps 6 and 8, and the final response from the MB-SMF to the NEF/MBSF.

Explain the power control mechanism for E-PUCH in the context of 3GPP TS 25.224 specifications.,"The power control mechanism for E-PUCH (Enhanced Physical Uplink Channel) in the context of 3GPP TS 25.224 specifications involves several components and procedures to ensure efficient and accurate transmission power settings. 

Firstly, the power of E-PUCH is determined based on three main components:
1. **Open Loop Component**: This is based on the beacon channel pathloss and the E-PUCH constant value (KE-PUCH) signalled by higher layers. The pathloss term (L) is derived from beacon function physical channel measurements and may include a weighted sum of instantaneous and filtered pathloss measurements.
2. **Closed-Loop TPC Component**: The closed-loop Transmit Power Control (TPC) component involves commands signalled to the User Equipment (UE) within each E-AGCH (Enhanced Absolute Grant Channel). The TPC command, derived by Node-B, adjusts the closed-loop quantity Pe-base. Upon receiving a TPC ","The answer should cover the following key points:

Describe the process of CA certificate delivery using HTTP Digest authentication as specified in TS 33.221 and TS 24.109.,"The process of CA certificate delivery using HTTP Digest authentication involves several steps to ensure secure communication between the User Equipment (UE) and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) portal. 

1. The sequence begins with the UE sending an empty HTTP request to the PKI portal.
2. The PKI portal responds with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code, which includes a WWW-Authenticate header. This header instructs the UE to use HTTP Digest authentication.
3. The UE then generates a new HTTP request to request the CA certificate. The request URL includes the CA issuer name, as specified in subclause 7.4.1 of WPKI. The serial number field is omitted. The Authorization header values are calculated using the identifier and the session key Ks_NAF. Although authentication of this HTTP request is not necessary, it is performed to comply with HTTP Digest authentication specifications. The identifier is also transported to the PKI portal.
4. The CA certificate delivery request follows this format:
   ```
   GET <base URL>?in=<issuer name>[other URL parameters] HTTP/1.1
   ```
   - `<base URL>` identifies the server or program.
   - `<issuer name>` is the base64 encoding of the DER encoded Issuer field in the X.509 certificate.
   - `[other URL parameters]` are additional, optional URL parameters.
5. Upon receiving the request, the PKI portal may verify the Authorization header by fetching the session key Ks_NAF from the bootstrapping server using the identifier. The PKI portal then generates an HTTP response containing the CA certificate and uses the session key Ks_NAF to authenticate and integrity protect the response using the Authentication-info header. The response could also be in another delivery protocol format, such as a PKCS#7 cryptographic message with content type signedData.
6. The HTTP response containing the CA certificate is formatted as follows:
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/x-x509-ca-cert
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <base64 encoded X.509 certificate blob>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```
7. When the UE receives the new CA certificate, it must validate the Authentication-info header. If the validation is successful, the user is notified that a new CA certificate is available. If the user accepts the new CA certificate, it is stored in the local certificate management system and marked as a ","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the conformance requirements and testing procedures for the EVENT: MT Call event as defined in 3GPP TS 31.124, including the necessary interfaces and optional features.","The conformance requirements and testing procedures for the EVENT: MT Call event are detailed in 3GPP TS 31.124. The EVENT: MT Call event must be supported by the Mobile Equipment (ME) as defined in TS 31.111 clauses 4.7, 5.2, 6.4.16, 6.8, 7.5, and 8.25. The purpose of the test is to verify that the ME informs the UICC that an Event: MT Call has occurred using the ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD - MT Call) command.

The testing procedure involves several steps:
1. Initial Conditions: The ME must be connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS, powered on, and perform the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure.
2. Procedure: The expected sequence includes the PROACTIVE COMMAND: SET UP EVENT LIST, where the command details, device identities, and event list are specified. The TERMINAL RESPONSE should indicate that the command was performed successfully. The EVENT DOWNLOAD - MT CALL involves specifying the event list, device identities, transaction identifier, and address details.

The main test interfaces for performing conformance tests include the UICC and NG-SS/NB-SS/E-USS/USS/SS interfaces. Depending on the network access scenario, different system simulators are required:
- Next Generation System Simulator for NG-RAN access
- NB System Simulator for E-UTRAN in NB-S1 mode
- Evolved Universal System Simulator for E-UTRAN in WB-S1 mode
- Universal System Simulator for UTRAN access

Describe the process and commands involved in requesting and transferring SMS or CBS messages stored in the Mobile Terminal (MT) according to 3GPP TS 27.005 specifications.,"The process of requesting and transferring SMS or CBS messages stored in the Mobile Terminal (MT) according to 3GPP TS 27.005 specifications involves several key steps and commands. 

Firstly, the concept of Short Message References is crucial. At the start of an SMS/CBS mode session, the MT numbers all messages contiguously starting with message number 1. These references are valid only for the duration of the session. If all references are used, the MT may reallocate references from deleted messages. Short Message Reference 0 signifies no messages in the MT and is used under specific conditions such as when an SMS is transferred over the air interface but not stored in the MT, for Class 0 SMSs, and for TE-specific SMSs.

To request all messages, the TE sends the GET FIRST MESSAGE command followed by the appropriate number of GET NEXT MESSAGE commands. The MT transfers messages one-by-one starting with the 'first' and continuing with the 'next'. If the MT exits SMS/CBS mode, this information need not be retained. If the TE receives an out-of-sequence message, it attempts to transfer the missing message using the GET MESSAGE command. If this fails, it indicates the message has been deleted or lost due to MT failure. The MT includes a LAST SHORT MESSAGE REFERENCE in the GET MESSAGE FAILURE response to help the TE detect errors.

For specific messages, the TE sends the GET MESSAGE command including the appropriate message reference. The MT responds with the full message including the header in a MESSAGE response. If the message reference is unallocated, the GET MESSAGE FAILURE response is returned with the cause 'No such message' and the highest valid Message Reference.

The commands involved in this process are:
- GET MESSAGE: Sent by the TE to request a specific message.
- GET FIRST MESSAGE: Sent by the TE to request the first available message.
- GET NEXT MESSAGE: Sent by the TE to request the next available message.

The responses from the MT include:
- MESSAGE response: Sent when a short message is requested.
- GET MESSAGE FAILURE response: Sent when a request cannot be fulfilled, indicating 'No such message' and providing the highest valid Message Reference.

Handling unallocated message references and out-of-sequence messages ensures the integrity of the message transfer process, with the LAST SHORT MESSAGE REFERENCE playing a role in error detection.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The concept of Short Message References and their allocation during an SMS/CBS mode session.
- The conditions under which Short Message Reference 0 is used.
- The process for requesting all messages or specific messages stored in the MT.

- The responses from the MT: MESSAGE response and GET MESSAGE FAILURE response.
- Handling of unallocated message references and out-of-sequence messages.

Describe the measurement uncertainty and test requirements for RF tests as specified in 3GPP TS 36.143.,"The measurement uncertainty and test requirements for RF tests as specified in 3GPP TS 36.143 are detailed through several key aspects. Firstly, the maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is defined for each test, with all tolerances and uncertainties being absolute values valid for a confidence level of 95%. This confidence level indicates that the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval contains 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment. For RF tests, these uncertainties apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not account for system effects due to mismatch between the Device Under Test (DUT) and the Test System.

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared against the Test Requirements based on the Shared Risk principle, which is defined in ITU-R M.1545. The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for each parameter must be included in the test report, and the recorded value for the Test System uncertainty must be equal to or lower than the specified figures. If the Test System has a measurement uncertainty greater than specified, it can still be used provided that the Test Requirement is tightened to make the test harder to pass, ensuring that non-compliant Test Systems do not increase the chance of passing a DUT that would otherwise fail.

Each test follows a standard format, including the title, definition and applicability, minimum requirement, test purpose, method of test, and test requirement. The test requirements are derived by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification using defined test tolerances. These tolerances are based on test system uncertainties, regulatory requirements, and criticality to system performance. If the test system uncertainty exceeds the allowed limit, the excess error is subtracted from the defined test tolerance to generate the correct tightened test requirements.

For example, if a test system has a 0.9 dB uncertainty for a test with a maximum output power tolerance of 0.7 dB, the excess error of 0.2 dB would be subtracted from the test tolerance, resulting in a modified test tolerance of 0.5 dB. This new tolerance would then be applied to the minimum requirement using the specified formula to give a new range for the manufacturer's rated output power. This approach ensures that the test requirements are accurately adjusted to account for any excess errors in the test system.","The answer should include the specified measurement uncertainty tolerance interval and confidence level for RF tests, the Shared Risk principle and its application, the standard format for test definitions, and the derivation of test requirements using test tolerances. It should also explain how non-compliant test systems are adjusted and how excess errors are handled."
Describe the test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction with non-MBSFN ABS as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction with non-MBSFN ABS involves several steps and conditions. 

Initial conditions include setting up the test environment to Normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH as defined in 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 4.1. The frequencies to be tested are specified in Annex E table E-1 and 3GPP TS 36.508 clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1, with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz as defined in clause 4.3.1. The SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources are connected to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Annex A figure A.54 of 3GPP TS 36.508. General test parameters are set according to Table 9.1.14.2.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0. Message contents are defined in clause 9.1.14.2.4.3.

The test procedure involves configuring all cells on the same carrier frequency. Cell 1 serves as both the serving cell and aggressor cell to Cell 3, while Cell 2 is the neighbor aggressor cell without CRS colliding to Cell 3. Cell 3 is measured for RSRP relative accuracy. The UE is configured by higher layers via Cell 1 with a time-domain measurement resource restriction pattern for performing E-UTRAN FDD intra-frequency measurements on neighbor cells, including Cell 3. The UE is also provided with CRS assistance information of Cell 2 before the measurements start.

The detailed steps of the test procedure are as follows:
1. Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.3 with exceptions listed in clause 7.2A.6.
2. Set the parameters according to Tables 9.1.14.2.4.1-1 and Table 9.1.14.2.5-1. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.1.
3. SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. The UE transmits an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE periodically transmits MeasurementReport messages.
6. After a 10-second wait from Step 3, SS checks the reported RSRP values in periodical MeasurementReport messages. The reported RSRP values for Cell 3 are compared to the actual RSRP values according to Table 9.1.14.2.5-2. If the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 3, the number of failed iterations is increased by one.
7. SS checks the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level according to Table G.2.3-1 in clause G.2 is achieved.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each sub-test in Table 9.1.14.2.5-1 as appropriate.

1. **Transport Layer Security (TLS) on HTTP-1**: The support of TLS on HTTP-1 is mandatory. The profile for TLS implementation and usage must follow the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310, annex E. If the PSK TLS-based authentication mechanism is supported, the HTTP client in the MC UE and the HTTP Proxy must support the TLS version, PSK ciphersuites, and TLS Extensions as specified in the TLS profile given in 3GPP TS 33.310, annex E.

Describe the structure and function of RLC/MAC blocks and the transport channels used for their transmission in the context of 3GPP TS 45.902 specifications.,"In the context of 3GPP TS 45.902 specifications, the MAC sublayer offers Transport Block Flows (TBFs) for the transfer of RLC data between peer RLC entities. One type of Transport Channel (TrCH) offered by FLO to the MAC sublayer is the Dedicated Channel (DCH), which is further categorized into three types: Control-plane DCH (CDCH), User-plane DCH (UDCH), and Associated DCH (ADCH). CDCH and UDCH are used exclusively for the transmission of RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer, while ADCH is used exclusively for the transmission of RLC/MAC control blocks. The naming conventions of CDCH, UDCH, and ADCH are introduced to facilitate easier stage 3 definitions of RLC and MAC protocols.

The structure of RLC/MAC blocks varies depending on the mode of RLC operation. In non-transparent RLC mode, an RLC/MAC block for data transfer consists of an RLC/MAC header and an RLC data block. In transparent RLC mode, it consists solely of an RLC data block. For control message transfer, the structure includes a MAC header and an RLC/MAC control block.

Reliable transport of signalling messages, including control plane messages and RLC/MAC control messages, is crucial throughout the radio access network, even under adverse channel conditions. Traditionally, strong protection for signalling has been ensured in GSM using CS1 coding for consistent performance across all cells and networks. With the flexibility offered by FLO, there is potential to change the protection for signalling and multiplex it with other radio bearers. However, for consistent performance, the configuration of signalling should remain fixed. The first Transport Format Combination (TFC), where the Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) equals 0, is used for sending signalling messages. In this TFC, only the transport channel carrying the transport blocks of the signalling is active, with a transport format of 184 bits transport blocks, 18 bits CRC, and 256 for the RMA.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The types of Transport Channels (TrCH) offered by FLO to the MAC sublayer, including DCH, CDCH, UDCH, and ADCH.

"Describe the physical random access procedure for PRACH in the context of 3GPP TS 25.224, including the role of different layers and the key parameters involved.","The physical random access procedure for PRACH in the context of 3GPP TS 25.224 involves several layers and key parameters. The transmit power for PRACH is set by higher layers based on open loop power control. The procedure is initiated upon request from the MAC sublayer, while the selection of a PRACH is done by the RRC layer. Before the physical random access procedure can be initiated, Layer 1 must receive specific information from the RRC layer using the primitives CPHY-TrCH-Config-REQ and CPHY-RL-Setup/Modify-REQ. This information includes the available PRACH channelization codes, timeslot, spreading factor, midamble type, RACH transport format, transport channel identity, and parameters for common physical channel uplink outer loop power control. Additionally, Layer 1 receives the ASC of the PRACH transmission and the data to be transmitted from the MAC. The physical random access procedure involves the following steps: randomly selecting one channelization code from the set of available codes for the selected ASC, determining the midamble shift based on the selected channelization code, setting the PRACH message transmission power level, and transmitting the RACH Transport Block Set with no timing advance in the selected sub-channel using the selected channelization code.

Describe the handling of Abstract Syntax Errors in SBC-AP messages according to 3GPP TS 29.168.,"Abstract Syntax Errors in SBC-AP messages occur when the receiving functional SBc-AP entity encounters issues with the structure or content of the received message. These errors are defined in several cases:

1. **Unknown IE id**: When the receiving entity receives Information Elements (IEs) or IE groups that it cannot understand.
2. **Logical Range Violations**: When the received IEs violate the logical range specified in the ASN.1 definition.
3. **Missing IEs**: When IEs or IE groups that are mandatory according to the specified presence are not present in the received message.
4. **Wrong Order or Too Many Occurrences**: When IEs or IE groups are received in the wrong order or with too many occurrences.
5. **Erroneously Present Conditional IEs**: When IEs or IE groups that should not be present according to the conditional presence are received.

The handling of these errors is based on Criticality and Presence Information. For cases 1 and 2, the errors are handled based on the received Criticality information. For case 3, the handling is based on both Criticality and Presence information. Cases 4 and 5 result in rejecting the procedure.

When an Abstract Syntax Error is detected, the receiver reads the remaining message and acts according to the Criticality and Presence Information for each detected error. Specifically, for cases 4 and 5, the handling is detailed in clause 4.5.3.6, which states that if a message initiating a procedure contains errors, the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value 'Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)'. If the information is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the procedure is terminated, and an Error Indication procedure is initiated.

For response messages with errors, the receiving node considers the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiates local error handling. The correct order of IEs is determined based on the specification version used by the receiver.

In summary, the handling of Abstract Syntax Errors in SBC-AP messages involves rejecting the procedure, reporting errors, and initiating error handling procedures based on the type of error and the specified Criticality and Presence Information.","The answer should cover the definition of Abstract Syntax Errors, the rules for constructing SBC-AP messages, the specific actions taken by the receiving node when errors are detected, and the handling based on Criticality and Presence Information. It should include examples of different types of errors and the corresponding procedures for handling them."
"Describe the key elements and functionalities of Virtual Reality (VR) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.118, including the audio formats and rendering systems used for VR.","Virtual Reality (VR) is defined as a rendered version of a delivered visual and audio scene, designed to mimic the sensory stimuli of the real world as naturally as possible to an observer or user. Typically, VR assumes the use of a head-mounted display (HMD) to replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and headphones to provide accompanying audio. Head and motion tracking are essential to update the visual and audio components, ensuring consistency with the user's movements. This tracking allows users to look around from a single observation point in 3D space, defined by either a producer or the position of capturing devices, with 3 degrees of freedom (3DOF): rolling (X-axis), pitching (Y-axis), and yawing (Z-axis).

For a full 3DOF VR experience, video content may be combined with simultaneously captured audio, binaurally rendered with an appropriate Binaural Room Impulse Response (BRIR). Interactivity is crucial for immersion, requiring movements to be instantaneously reflected in the rendering.

Audio for VR can be produced using three formats: channels-based, objects-based, and scene-based, or a hybrid of these formats. The audio encoding system must produce suitable audio bitstreams representing a well-defined audio signal in the reference system. The VR Audio Receiving system uses these bitstreams to recover audio signals and VR Audio Rendering metadata, which are defined by the media profile. Different audio rendering systems can then render the audio based on the decoded signals, metadata, and user position. Media profiles ensure that at least one Audio Rendering System is defined as a reference renderer, with additional systems potentially defined. For more details on audio rendering, refer to clause 4.5.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of Virtual Reality as a rendered version of visual and audio scenes, the use of head-mounted displays and headphones, and the importance of head and motion tracking for an immersive experience.

Describe the role and characteristics of the IPFlow node in the context of flow distribution rules.,"The IPFlow node plays a crucial role in defining the flow description for a particular flow distribution rule. It occurs once within the rule and is formatted as a node. The IPFlow node can be accessed using Get or Replace methods. An empty IPFlow node signifies a match-all flow description, meaning it will match any traffic.

What are the requirements for out-of-band emissions for repeater type 2-O in FR2 according to 3GPP TS 38.115?,"The requirements for out-of-band emissions for repeater type 2-O in FR2 according to 3GPP TS 38.115 are as follows:

1. **General Requirements**: The out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted emission limits. These limits apply from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. The values of ΔfOBUE are defined in table 6.5.1-1 for the NR operating bands. The requirements apply to all types of transmitters and transmission modes specified by the manufacturer. For a RIB operating in contiguous CA, the requirements apply to the frequencies starting from the edge of the passband. For a RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any gap between passbands.

2. **Category A Limits**: Repeater type 2-O unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the following tables:
   - Table 6.5.3.4.1-1: OBUE limits applicable in the frequency range 24.25 – 33.4 GHz.
   - Table 6.5.3.4.1-2: OBUE limits applicable in the frequency range 37 – 43.5 GHz.

"Describe the procedure and parameters involved in uplink media streaming access reporting by the 5GMSu AS to the Data Collection AF, including the configuration and frequency of reporting.","The procedure for reporting uplink media streaming access by the 5GMSu AS to the Data Collection AF involves several steps and configurations. Initially, the 5GMSu AS obtains its data collection client configuration at reference point R4 as part of its initialization procedure. This configuration is periodically refreshed to ensure any changes are appropriately acted upon.

The reporting procedure is illustrated in figure 6.8.2-1, where the 5GMSu AS uses the data report defined in clause 4.6.1 of TS 26.531 to report the activity of uplink media streaming access by the Media Streamer. Each uplink access logged by the 5GMSu AS is reported as a single record in a report submitted to the Data Collection AF at reference point R4.

The parameters included in the data report for each uplink media streaming access are described in Table 6.8.4-1. These parameters provide detailed information about the media streaming activity, ensuring accurate and comprehensive reporting.

The frequency of reporting is determined by the data collection client configuration obtained using the procedure defined in clause 6.8.1. This configuration specifies how often reports should be sent to the Data Collection AF.

The static data model for data collection and reporting, as depicted in figure 4.6.1-1, includes provisioning information, data sampling rules, data reporting rules, and data processing instructions. Provisioning information pertains to one application and one type of exposed event, uniquely identified by its Event ID. Data sampling rules specify how parameters associated with the Event ID are collected, while data reporting rules define how the collected data parameters are reported to the Data Collection AF. Data processing instructions and data exposure restrictions are expressed as Data Access Profiles, which limit the types of event consumers authorized to subscribe to the Event ID and specify aggregation functions applied to UE data prior to exposure.

"Describe the procedures involved in managing MBMS sessions in GERAN, including session start, update, repeated notifications, and session stop.","Managing MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) sessions in GERAN (GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network) involves several key procedures: session start, session update, repeated notifications, and session stop.

1. **Session Start**:
   - Upon receiving an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message from the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), the network creates an MBMS Service Context if it is not already available for the ongoing MBMS broadcast session.
   - The network acknowledges the SGSN using an MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message.
   - The network may receive an Allocation/Retention Priority associated with the MBMS session, which can be used to prioritize between MBMS and non-MBMS bearer services.
   - The network initiates the MBMS channel establishment in each cell within the MBMS service area where the service is to be provided. The channel establishment procedure includes optional pre-notification of the MBMS service, notification of all MBMS users in the cell, an optional counting procedure, and a channel assignment message.

2. **Session Update**:
   - When the GERAN receives an MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message from the SGSN, it updates the MBMS service area.
   - The network releases the MBMS channel in cells that no longer belong to the updated MBMS service area and acknowledges the SGSN with an MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message.

3. **Repeated Notifications**:
   - The network may send repeated notifications of an ongoing MBMS session, providing the estimated remaining duration of the session.
   - Mobile stations that are already receiving the MBMS session should ignore these repeated notifications.

4. **Session Stop**:
   - Upon receiving an MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message from the SGSN, the network acknowledges this request with an MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message.
   - The network removes all radio resources allocated for the MBMS session.
   - If the network decides to prematurely release the bearer supporting the MBMS session, it sends a PACKET TBF RELEASE message.
   - At the end of an MBMS session, indicated by the expiry of the Session Duration Timer, mobile stations notify the upper layers.
   - If an MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message is received during an ongoing session, the network releases the MBMS channel in cells no longer part of the updated service area and acknowledges with an MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message.

These procedures ensure efficient management of MBMS sessions, optimizing resource allocation and maintaining service continuity in GERAN.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The steps involved in starting an MBMS session, including the creation of MBMS Service Context and channel establishment.

"Describe the procedures and error handling mechanisms for reserving IMS connection points and configuring remote resources in the context of priority calls/sessions when IM-MGW is congested, as outlined in TS 29.163.","When the MGCF requests a resource via the Reserve IMS Connection Point and configure remote resources procedure or Reserve IMS Connection Point procedure and receives an error indicating that the requested resource could not be seized (e.g., H.248 error code #510 'insufficient resources'), several mechanisms are in place to handle priority calls/sessions:

1. **Queuing Mechanism (Document 1)**: If the MGCF does not have an alternative IM-MGW through which it can route the call/session, it queues the priority call/session and gives it priority over any further Reserve IMS Connection Point and configure remote resources or Reserve IMS Connection Point procedures for lower priority calls/sessions towards this IM-MGW until the requested resource for the queued call/session is successfully seized. This process is illustrated in Figure 9.4.2.1.

2. **Seizing New IM-MGW (Document 2)**: If Media Gateway Groups are implemented, the MGCF seizes a new IM-MGW from the same Media Gateway Group before resorting to any queuing of the priority call/session. This approach aims to enable the MPS call/session to proceed as early as possible, avoiding the need for queuing as described in clause 9.4.2.

3. **Priority Information Inclusion (Document 3)**: If the IM-MGW supports Priority information (e.g., determined through provisioning or package profile), the MGCF includes the Priority information in the resource request. The IM-MGW may then provide priority allocation of resources once a congestion threshold is reached. If the IM-MGW is completely congested, it shall indicate this to the MGCF as described in clause 9.4.2. Additionally, the IM-MGW may provide priority allocation for resources requested via a subsequent Configure IMS resources procedure not including Priority information if the related context has been marked with priority information during the Reserve IMS Connection Point procedure or Reserve IMS Connection Point and configure remote resources procedure. This process is illustrated in Figure 9.4.4.1.

These procedures ensure that priority calls/sessions are handled efficiently even during congestion, with mechanisms for queuing, seizing new resources, and prioritizing resource allocation based on the inclusion of Priority information.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The specific error handling mechanism when requested resources cannot be seized (e.g., H.248 error code #510).
- The queuing mechanism for priority calls/sessions when no alternative IM-MGW is available.

Describe the direct security mode control procedure and the direct link rekeying procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334.,"The direct security mode control procedure can be initiated by a commanding UE in response to receiving a DIRECT_COMMUNICATION_REQUEST or a DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message. If the procedure is between a remote UE and a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE and is triggered by a DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST to refresh only KD-sess but not KD, either UE can act as the commanding UE. Otherwise, the ProSe UE-to-network relay UE must act as the commanding UE if both keys are to be refreshed.

To initiate the procedure, the commanding UE identifies an existing KD based on the KD ID included in the received message or derives a new KD if necessary. The commanding UE generates the MSB of KD ID to ensure uniqueness and combines it with the LSB of KD-sess ID to form a unique KD-sess ID. A 128-bit Nonce_2 value is then generated, and KD-sess is derived using KD, Nonce_2, and Nonce_1 from the received message.

The DIRECT_SECURITY_MODE_COMMAND message is constructed with Nonce_2, the LSB of KD-sess ID, UE Security Capabilities, and Chosen Algorithms. Additional parameters are included if the message is used between a remote UE and a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE or for isolated one-to-one ProSe direct communication. The message is sent unciphered but integrity protected with the new security context, and timer T4111 is started.

The direct link rekeying procedure involves the target UE processing the received DIRECT_REKEYING_REQUEST message and initiating the direct security mode control procedure if no active timer T4112 is running. If timer T4112 is running, the target UE stops the timer and initiates the procedure if certain conditions are met. For a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, a Key Request procedure to the PKMF is triggered if the Auth Flag IE is included in the message or if the UE wants to refresh KD.

Upon completion of the direct security mode control procedure, the target UE sends a DIRECT_REKEYING_RESPONSE message to notify the initiating UE, which then stops timer T4112.","The answer must include the steps for initiating the direct security mode control procedure, the roles of the commanding UE, the generation and identification of KD and KD-sess, the construction and content of the DIRECT_SECURITY_MODE_COMMAND message, the handling of different scenarios (ProSe UE-to-network relay UE and isolated one-to-one ProSe direct communication), the selection of algorithms, the integrity protection of the message, and the use of timer T4111. Additionally, it should cover the conditions for initiating the direct security mode control procedure, the handling of timer T4112, the triggering of the Key Request procedure to PKMF, the sending of the DIRECT_REKEYING_RESPONSE message, and the stopping of timer T4112."

"Describe the requirements and declarations for secondary CPICH power levels and demodulation CPICH power levels in UTRA FDD MIMO transmission, as well as the manufacturer declarations for radiated test requirements in hybrid and OTA AAS BS.","The requirements for secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) power levels and demodulation CPICH (D-CPICH) power levels in UTRA FDD MIMO transmission are detailed in TS 37.145. For UTRA FDD AAS BS operating with two or four TAB connector groups, the S-CPICH power is the code domain power of the Secondary Common Pilot Channel. This power is equal to the sum of the P-CPICH power and the power offset, which are signaled to the UE. The power offset for S-CPICH is signaled in the Information Element (IE) 'Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO' for MIMO mode with two antennas, and in the IE 'Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna2' for MIMO mode with four antennas. Similarly, the power offset for S-CPICH on antennas 3 and 4 is signaled in the IE 'Common Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on antenna 3 and 4'.

The D-CPICH power is the code domain power of the Demodulation Common Pilot Channel, which is also equal to the sum of the P-CPICH power and the power offset signaled to the UE. The power offset for D-CPICH on antennas 3 and 4 is signaled in the IE 'Common Power Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on antenna 3 and 4'.

The accuracy level of the power offset for both S-CPICH and D-CPICH can affect MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI reporting performance. Additionally, at high geometry levels, PDSCH performance may be impacted if D-CPICH is not scheduled.

Regarding manufacturer declarations for radiated test requirements in hybrid and OTA AAS BS, TS 37.145 specifies that manufacturers must provide declarations in categories D9.x and D10.x for radiated Tx and Rx requirements, respectively. From Rel-15 onwards, additional D11.x declarations are introduced for OTA AAS BS to distinguish them from the Rel-13/14 OTA declarations applicable to hybrid AAS BS. These declarations are listed in tables 4.10-1 and 4.10-2, which outline the specific requirements for radiated testing.","The answer must include details on the secondary CPICH power level requirements for different TAB connector groups, the demodulation CPICH requirements, how TAB connectors are mapped to antennas, and the signaling of power offsets for S-CPICH and D-CPICH. It should also cover the manufacturer declarations required for radiated test requirements in hybrid and OTA AAS BS, including the distinction between different declaration categories and the relevant tables for these declarations."
Describe the test procedure for verifying inter-frequency SS-RSRQ relative measurement accuracy as specified in TS 38.533.,"The test procedure for verifying inter-frequency SS-RSRQ relative measurement accuracy as specified in TS 38.533 involves several key steps and conditions. 

Firstly, the purpose of this test is to ensure that the inter-frequency SS-RSRQ relative measurement accuracy is within the specified limits for all bands. This test is applicable to all types of NR UE supporting E-UTRA and EN-DC from Release 15 onwards. The minimum conformance requirements for this test are specified in clause 4.7.2.0.2, with the normative reference being TS 38.133 clause A.4.7.2.2.2.

The initial conditions for the test require the use of specific test configurations listed in Table 4.7.2.2.2.4.1-1. The test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) must be configured according to the parameters in Table 4.7.2.2.2.4.1-2. Cell 1 is designated as the E-UTRA serving cell (PCell) for the EN-DC setup, while Cell 2 and Cell 3 are NR FR1 cells operating on two different FR1 frequencies. Cell 2 acts as the PSCell and Cell 3 is the target cell for SS-RSRQ measurements. The connection setup follows the settings outlined in clause C.1.1.

The test procedure involves the following steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific parameters for Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer MCG and SCG, Connected without release On, and Test Mode On, as per TS 38.508-1 clause 4.5.
2. Set the parameters according to Table 4.7.2.2.2.5-1 as appropriate.
3. The SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. The UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE periodically transmits MeasurementReport messages.
6. After a 10-second wait from Step 3, the SS checks the SS-RSRQ reported values in the periodic MeasurementReport. The SS-RSRQ value of Cell 3 reported by the UE is compared to the SS-RSRQ value of Cell 2 reported by the UE. If the difference between the values is outside the limits specified in Table 4.7.2.2.2.5-2 or if the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 3 or Cell 2, the number of failed iterations is increased by one. Otherwise, the number of passed iterations is increased by one.
7. The SS continues checking the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level specified in Table G.2.3-1 in Annex G is achieved.
8. Set the parameters according to each sub-test in Table 4.7.2.2.2.5-1 as appropriate and repeat steps 5-7.

The test requirements include primary level settings defined in Table 4.7.2.2.2.5-1 and absolute accuracy requirements in Table 4.7.2.2.2.5-2. For the test to pass, the ratio of successful reported values in each test must be more than 90% with a confidence level of 95%.","The answer must include:
  - The purpose of the test and its applicability to NR UE supporting E-UTRA and EN-DC from Release 15 onwards.
  - Reference to minimum conformance requirements and normative documents.
  - Detailed initial conditions including test configurations and cell settings.
  - Step-by-step test procedure including RRC connection setup, parameter settings, message transmissions, and measurement report checks.
  - Test requirements including primary level settings, accuracy requirements, and criteria for passing the test."
Describe the differences between the SGSN number and the SGSN address as defined in 3GPP TS 23.008.,"The SGSN number and SGSN address are both important elements in the management of subscriber data within mobile networks, but they serve different purposes and are stored under different conditions.

The SGSN number is the SS7 address of the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). It is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 and is considered temporary subscriber data. The SGSN number is stored in the Home Location Register (HLR) for a GPRS subscription and conditionally in the Visitor Location Register (VLR) if the Gs interface is installed. The absence of the SGSN number in the HLR indicates that the mobile station is deregistered for GPRS or the subscriber does not have a GPRS subscription. Similarly, the absence of the SGSN number in the VLR indicates no association between the VLR and the SGSN for the mobile station. Additionally, the SGSN number is stored in the Central Subscriber Service (CSS), and its absence there indicates that no subsequent update of the Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) subscription information is needed at the SGSN upon CSG subscription change.

On the other hand, the SGSN address is the IP address of the SGSN currently serving the mobile station. It is also defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 and is considered temporary subscriber data. The SGSN address is stored in the HLR and conditionally in the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). The SGSN address is crucial for routing data packets to the correct SGSN that is currently serving the mobile station.

In summary, the SGSN number is an SS7 address used for subscriber data management and is stored in the HLR, VLR, and CSS under specific conditions. The SGSN address is an IP address used for routing data packets and is stored in the HLR and GGSN. Both are temporary subscriber data but serve different roles in the network operations.","The answer should clearly differentiate between the SGSN number and the SGSN address. It should include the definitions of both terms, their storage locations, and the conditions under which they are stored. Additionally, it should explain the significance of each in the context of subscriber data management and network operations."
What are the requirements for UE initial transmission timing error and adjustments according to 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The requirements for UE initial transmission timing error and adjustments according to 3GPP TS 36.521 are as follows:

1. **UE Initial Transmission Timing Error Limit (Te)**: The UE initial transmission timing error must be less than or equal to Te, where Te is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.1.2 and shown in Table 7.1.14.3-1. This requirement applies to the first transmission in a DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, the first transmission in a repetition period (R>1) for PUCCH, PUSCH, and SRS, or the PRACH transmission.

2. **Reference Point for UE Initial Transmit Timing Control**: The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control requirement is the downlink timing of the reference cell. The downlink timing is defined as the time when the first detected path of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference cell. For PRACH, NTA_Ref is defined as 0, and for other channels, it is the difference between UE transmission timing and the downlink timing immediately after the last timing advance was applied. NTA_Ref for other channels remains unchanged until the next timing advance is received.

3. **Adjustments for Non-First Transmissions**: When it is not the first transmission in a DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, or there is no DRX or eDRX_CONN cycle, and for PUCCH, PUSCH, and SRS transmissions, the UE must be capable of changing the transmission timing according to the received downlink frame of the serving cell, except when the timing advance is applied. The UE transmission timing error must be less than or equal to Te as specified in Table 7.1.14.3-1.

4. **Maximum Autonomous Time Adjustment Step (Tq)**: When no repetition period is configured, or the configured repetition period is R=1, the maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment must be Tq seconds. The minimum aggregate adjustment rate must be 7 * TS per second, and the maximum aggregate adjustment rate must be Tq per 200 ms. Tq is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.24.2 and shown in Table 7.1.14.3-2.

5. **Repetition Period Configurations**: When a repetition period is configured on the uplink, the UE must not adjust the uplink transmission timing autonomously during an ongoing repetition period for which R>1.

6. **Impact of Timing Advance**: The timing advance application impacts the UE transmission timing. The UE must adjust its transmission timing according to the received downlink frame of the serving cell, except when the timing advance is applied.

These requirements ensure that the UE maintains accurate transmission timing, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the network and minimizing interference.","The answer must include the definition of the UE initial transmission timing error limit (Te) and its reference point, conditions under which this limit applies, rules for timing adjustments when it is not the first transmission, the maximum autonomous time adjustment step (Tq), and the impact of timing advance on UE transmission timing. Additionally, it should cover the repetition period configurations and their effect on timing adjustments."
Describe the considerations and methods for handling bitrate variations in RTP sessions for speech and video as outlined in 3GPP TS 26.114.,"The handling of bitrate variations in RTP sessions for speech and video as outlined in 3GPP TS 26.114 involves several considerations and methods. 

For speech, an MTSI client using variable bitrate encoding must ensure that the transmitted bandwidth does not exceed the negotiated bandwidth (b=AS) nor the QoS bandwidth parameters (MBR, GBR) for the bearer, if defined and known. This can be achieved by controlling the bit-rate used for encoding each media frame or by controlling when the generated packets are transmitted, a method known as 'packet pacing'. However, excessive use of packet pacing can increase end-to-end delay and potentially fail to meet service requirements. The average bandwidth of transmitted packets should be calculated over a sliding window, typically 2 seconds, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum allowed bandwidth in the sending direction.

For video, variable bitrate encoding is used to maintain a sufficiently low average bit-rate while allowing for temporarily higher bit-rates to match video content with high motion activity or complex scenes. The bitrate control should ensure that the average bandwidth of transmitted media packets does not exceed the maximum allowed bandwidth in the sending direction. This involves managing the size of large frames, the proportion of neighboring frames that can be reduced in size, and the length of the averaging window. When any two of these properties are known, the third can be determined. The recommended procedure includes reducing the encoding bit-rate of neighboring frames in a balanced manner, considering the spatio-temporal tradeoff of video quality. Additionally, when a Full Intra Request (FIR) is received, the MTSI client may delay the generation and transmission of an Intra frame by up to half of the averaging window.

Overall, the methods for handling bitrate variations in RTP sessions for speech and video require careful control of encoding bit-rates and packet transmission timing to ensure compliance with bandwidth constraints and maintain media quality.","The answer should cover the general and media-specific considerations for handling bitrate variations in RTP sessions. It should explain the methods for controlling bitrate and packet transmission for speech and video, including packet pacing and its impact on end-to-end delay. Additionally, it should detail the properties managed in video bitrate control, the recommended procedures for reducing neighboring frame sizes, and handling FIRs."
"Describe the procedures and mechanisms for DTMF tone transmission and reception in the IM CN subsystem, including the roles of MGCF, IM-MGW, and the Mn interface, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.163 and TS 29.164.","The procedures and mechanisms for DTMF tone transmission and reception in the IM CN subsystem involve several key components and interfaces, primarily the MGCF (Media Gateway Control Function), IM-MGW (IP Multimedia Media Gateway), and the Mn interface.

When a SIP User Agent (UA) sends DTMF tones to the IM-MGW, the IM-MGW may report this information via the Mn interface to the MGCF. The MGCF then sends an APM (Application Protocol Message) to the BICC (Bearer Independent Call Control) network with specific values for the action indicator, signal, and duration parameters. If the BICC network sends an APM message with DTMF signal, duration, and action indicator to the MGCF, the MGCF may relay this information to the IM-MGW via the Mn interface. The IM-MGW will then send the corresponding DTMF signal and duration information on the user plane of the IM CN subsystem according to RFC 4733.

DTMF digits, telephony tones, and signals can be transferred using different mechanisms. For the IM CN Subsystem, 3GPP TS 24.229 defines the usage of the RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) payload format for DTMF digits, telephony tones, and signals as specified in RFC 4733. When BICC signaling is used in the CS (Circuit Switched) network, telephony signals may be sent either inband or out-of-band as defined in ITU-T Recommendations Q.1902.4 and Q.765.5. If ISUP (ISDN User Part) signaling is used, DTMF tones are sent inband.

Before the actual usage of telephony signals can occur, the sending and receiving of telephone events need to be agreed upon using the SDP (Session Description Protocol) offer-answer mechanism defined in RFC 3264. The negotiation outcome can vary, such as no telephone events being sent in RTP payload, telephone events being sent only in one direction, or in both directions. If the negotiation results in telephone events being sent in both directions, the IM-MGW may still be configured to interwork only mobile-originated telephone events.

For CS Network Originating Sessions, the MGCF includes the MIME type ","The answer must include the detailed procedures for sending and receiving DTMF tones in the IM CN subsystem, highlighting the roles of MGCF, IM-MGW, and the Mn interface. It should cover the mechanisms for transferring DTMF digits, telephony tones, and signals using RTP payload format as defined in RFC 4733, and the offer-answer negotiation process. Additionally, it should explain the modifications for external SIP-I network characteristics, including the transport modes of DTMF and the control node's configuration procedures."
Describe the key elements and definitions related to radio frame structures and channel bandwidth as specified in 3GPP TS 36.211 and TS 36.112.,"The 3GPP TS 36.211 specification outlines the organization of downlink, uplink, and sidelink transmissions into radio frames. There are three supported radio frame structures: Type 1, which is applicable to Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) only; Type 2, which is applicable to Time Division Duplex (TDD) only; and Type 3, which is applicable to Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) secondary cell operation only. Notably, LAA secondary cell operation is exclusive to frame structure Type 3. Multi-cell aggregation is also supported, allowing up to 31 secondary cells to be used in addition to the primary cell, making a total of up to 32 serving cells. Different frame structures can be used in different serving cells during multi-cell aggregation.

The 3GPP TS 36.112 specification provides definitions for various symbols related to channel bandwidth and aggregated channel bandwidth. These include:
- BWChannel: Channel bandwidth.
- BWChannel_CA: Aggregated Channel bandwidth.
- Ês: Received energy per Resource Element (RE), power normalized to the subcarrier spacing during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the cyclic prefix, at the LMU antenna connector.
- Fedge_high: Upper edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
- Fedge_low: Lower edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
- Io: Total received power density, including signal and interference, as measured at the User Equipment (UE) antenna connector.
- Iot: Received power spectral density of the total noise and interference for a certain RE, power integrated over the RE and normalized to the subcarrier spacing, as measured at the LMU antenna connector.
- Ts: The basic unit of time defined in TS 36.211 clause 4.

These definitions and elements are crucial for understanding the organization and measurement of radio transmissions and channel bandwidth in 3GPP specifications.","The answer should include a detailed description of the three types of radio frame structures (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) and their specific applications (FDD, TDD, LAA secondary cell operation). It should also explain the concept of multi-cell aggregation, including the number of secondary cells and the possibility of using different frame structures in different serving cells. Additionally, the answer should define key symbols related to channel bandwidth and aggregated channel bandwidth, such as BWChannel, BWChannel_CA, Ês, Fedge_high, Fedge_low, Io, Iot, and Ts, and explain their significance in the context of 3GPP specifications."
"Describe the procedures and interactions involved in quota management for S-NSSAIs during registration, deregistration, and roaming scenarios.","Quota management for S-NSSAIs involves several procedures and interactions during registration, deregistration, and roaming scenarios. 

During registration with added S-NSSAIs subject to quota management, the UE registers and indicates the requested NSSAI. The AMF checks the subscription information to identify subscribed NSSAIs related to slices subject to quota limitations. If some S-NSSAIs are subject to quota management, the NSSF is invoked. The NSSF increments counters for applicable S-NSSAIs and may exclude them from the allowed NSSAI if the quota is reached, or allow them with an indication that the quota is reached. The NSSF may report some S-NSSAIs reaching quota to the charging subsystem. The AMF then communicates the allowed NSSAI and any rejected S-NSSAI(s) with the cause code related to quota capping and any back-off timer to the UE.

In the case of registration with abandoned S-NSSAIs subject to quota management, the UE registers, and the AMF reports missing S-NSSAIs from the previous allowed NSSAI to the NSSF. The NSSF decrements the counters for the abandoned S-NSSAIs and provides the allowed NSSAI and other usual information to the AMF, which then accepts the registration.

During deregistration with S-NSSAIs subject to quota management, the UE deregisters, or the AMF initiates a network-initiated deregistration procedure. The AMF reports abandoned S-NSSAIs to the NSSF, which then decrements the counters for these S-NSSAIs and acknowledges the message.

In roaming scenarios, the V-NSSF detects that certain S-NSSAIs of HPLMN mapping to VPLMN S-NSSAI are subject to quota management. The V-NSSF reports the addition or removal of UEs to the HPLMN NSSF, which updates the counters and detects if any action is required. The HPLMN NSSF responds to the V-NSSF with any required actions and back-off timers, which the V-NSSF then reports to the AMF.

These procedures ensure effective quota management for S-NSSAIs, maintaining network performance and resource allocation.","The answer must include detailed descriptions of the procedures for registration with added and abandoned S-NSSAI(s) subject to quota management, the interactions between UE, AMF, and NSSF, the handling of quota limits, and the reporting mechanisms. It should also cover the interactions between V-NSSF and H-NSSF for quota management in roaming scenarios, including the steps for reporting additions/removals of UEs, updating counters, and communication of actions required. Additionally, the answer should describe the deregistration process with S-NSSAI(s) subject to quota management, including the reporting of abandoned S-NSSAI(s) and decrementing counters."
"Describe the structure and types of datasets defined in TS 29.364, including how new datasets are handled and the rules for dataset alignment.","The structure and types of datasets defined in TS 29.364 are designed to accommodate various MMTEL services. In the current release, the following datasets are defined: the MMTELPSTN-ISDN-CS dataset, which contains parameters associated with the subset of MMTEL services matching the PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services; the AOC dataset, which includes parameters for the AOC service; the FA pilot dataset, which contains parameters of the FA pilot in the FA service; and the FA member dataset, which includes parameters of the FA member in the FA service. Additional services, such as new MMTEL services or proprietary MMTEL services, can be defined using new datasets.

The datasets are structured in a compact format that consists of a tag-length-value format, including a defined 'dataset identifier' and 'length', followed by a fixed format structure where defined bits, bytes, and 4-byte tuples represent known or reserved information elements of a MMTEL service. To accommodate the length variation of some data, such as SIP-URI, a variable length section is included. A dataset must be 4-byte aligned, and the size of the dataset should be a multiple of 4 bytes, achieved with a padding feature at the end of the dataset. Common data forms within a dataset structure include terms and rules derived from common practice for 32-bit processors, such as Byte (octet), Long (4 bytes, signed and unsigned), and Short (2 bytes, signed and unsigned). Bit fields take up only the number of bits they specify and are not aligned across a 4-byte boundary.

When new datasets are introduced according to subclause 6.2.2, they may be included in the same transparent data containing the MMTEL-PSTN-CS dataset and associated with the same service indication. An Application Server (AS) that does not support these new datasets must not modify the content of these datasets when rewriting the transparent data in the Home Subscriber Server (HSS).","The answer should cover the types of datasets defined in the release, the compact structure and alignment rules of datasets, and the handling of new datasets in transparent data. It should include specific details such as the tag-length-value format, fixed format structure, variable length section, and definitions of common data forms. Additionally, it should explain the rule that an AS should not modify unsupported datasets when rewriting transparent data in the HSS."
"Describe the procedure and pre-conditions for the VAE server to send network monitoring information notifications to V2X UEs, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.286 9.7.4.2.","The procedure for the VAE server to send network monitoring information notifications to V2X UEs involves several pre-conditions and steps. 

Pre-conditions:
1. The VAE server, acting as a Service Capability Server/Application Server (SCS/AS), must be configured with Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) information and authorized to exchange information with the SCEF as specified in subclause 4.9 of 3GPP TS 23.682. Additionally, the VAE server must have subscribed to the Quality of Service (QoS) notification service from the 5G System (5GS), which may include requests for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 or QoS change notification requests as provided by Session Management Function (SMF) and specified in 3GPP TS 23.287.
2. V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 must have subscribed to receive network monitoring information from the VAE server.
3. The VAE server may be aware of the Radio Access Technology (RAT) type supported by the V2X UE from the registration of the VAE client.

Procedure:
1. The VAE server communicates with the SCEF to receive network monitoring information as per the procedure in subclause 4.9 of 3GPP TS 23.682. It may also communicate with Network Exposure Function (NEF) or Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) to receive QoS monitoring information and data analytics from the 5GS, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.288. The VAE server may determine whether to receive network monitoring information from the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) or the 5G Core (5GC), or both, considering the RAT type provided by the UE. The subscription to QoS monitoring service from 5GS may be active for a certain period or a specific geographical area. The monitoring may include requests for QoS sustainability events or QoS change notification requests, and the reporting can be configured by the application enabler layer based on area, time, periodicity, service requirements, and other parameters such as expected congestion, time of day, and road conditions. Based on the subscription, 5GS provides the extended QoS monitoring report over the N33 interface, which may come from NWDAF or SMF via PCF/NEF.
2. The network monitoring information available at the VAE server, such as uplink or downlink link degradations and congestions, is based on the original network monitoring information provided by the SCEF and/or QoS monitoring report or data analytics from 5GS. The VAE server determines the network monitoring information to send to the UE.
3. The monitoring information is sent to the subscribed V2X UEs via network monitoring information notifications.","The answer must include:

"Describe the unified access control mechanism in the 5G system, including the criteria for access attempts and the flexibility for operators.","The unified access control mechanism in the 5G system is designed to manage access attempts based on various criteria influenced by operator policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services. This mechanism categorizes each access attempt into one or more Access Identities and one of the Access Categories. Operators use these categories to determine whether an access attempt should be allowed or blocked, especially during congestion.

Access Identities and Access Categories are central to this control system. Access Identities represent different types of users or devices, while Access Categories define the priority or type of service being requested. The unified access control system allows operators to control access based on these predefined criteria, ensuring efficient network management and service delivery.

Moreover, the system is designed with extensibility and flexibility in mind. It supports the inclusion of additional standardized Access Identities and Access Categories, allowing the system to evolve with new standards and requirements. Operators also have the flexibility to define their own Access Categories using their own criteria, such as network slicing, specific applications, or application servers.

Additionally, the unified access control mechanism replaces obsolete clauses from TS 22.011 with updated guidelines in TS 22.261. When a User Equipment (UE) is configured for Extended Access Barring (EAB) according to TS 22.011, it is also configured for delay-tolerant services in the 5G system, ensuring compatibility and enhanced service delivery.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how operator policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services influence access control.
  - Description of Access Identities and Access Categories and their role in access control.

Describe the handover procedures and conditions for BTS transmission and reception as specified in 3GPP TS 48.058.,"The handover procedures and conditions for BTS transmission and reception as specified in 3GPP TS 48.058 involve several key steps and elements. 

Firstly, BTS starts transmission immediately on the main channel in the indicated mode and with encryption if indicated. If the MS Power element is present, the BTS may start transmission also on the SACCH. When receiving a correct access burst with the correct handover reference, BTS starts the normal reception process on the main channel in the indicated mode and starts receiving (and sending if not started earlier) on SACCH. Deciphering is started if indicated, and the handover detection procedure towards BSC is initiated.

Secondly, if both the MS Power and Timing Advance elements are present, BTS shall start transmission on SACCH with the timing advance and MS power control parameters indicated. If only the MS Power element is present, BTS may start transmission on SACCH. Upon receiving a correct access burst with the correct handover reference, BTS starts the normal reception process on the main channel in the indicated mode, with deciphering applied if indicated, and starts receiving (and sending if not started earlier) on SACCH. Alternatively, the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS on the main channel allows the start of sending on SACCH and initiates the handover detection procedure towards the BSC.

The procedure used between the target BTS and BSC when a handed over MS accesses the new BTS is initiated by BTS upon detection of an MS on a channel activated for handover. In the case of an asynchronous handover, BTS builds the PHYSical INFOrmation message, sends it to MS in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link, and starts timer T3105. A HANDOver DETection message is sent to BSC, containing the measured delay of the access burst. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from MS, BTS repeats the PHYSical INFOrmation message to MS. If the message has been repeated Ny1 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from MS, BTS sends a CONNECTION FAILURE message to BSC with the cause value ","The answer must include the conditions under which BTS starts transmission and reception on the main channel and SACCH, the role of MS Power and Timing Advance elements, the process of handover detection towards BSC, and the differences between asynchronous and synchronous handover procedures. It should also cover the specific messages exchanged between BTS and BSC during handover."
What are the data collection capabilities of NWDAF for redundant transmission experience and UE mobility as specified in 3GPP TS 23.700 and TS 23.288?,"The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) has extensive data collection capabilities for both redundant transmission experience and UE mobility. According to 3GPP TS 23.700, NWDAF can collect UE mobility information from Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), the 5G Core (5GC), and Application Functions (AFs). It also gathers service data from AFs and information for PDU sessions established with redundant transmission from Network Functions (NF) and OAM. Key measurements include packet drop and/or packet delay per Quality of Flow Identifier (QFI) or GTP level (Table 6.68.2-1) and information related to PDU sessions with redundant transmission (Table 6.68.2-2).

In 3GPP TS 23.288, NWDAF's data collection for UE mobility includes MDT data from OAM, network data from 5GC, and service data from AFs. Specifically, UE mobility information from OAM includes UE location carried in MDT data, while network data from 5GC encompasses UE location information, UE location trends, and UE access behavior trends (Table 6.7.2.2-1). Service data related to UE mobility provided by AFs is detailed in Table 6.7.2.2-2. Data collection can be tailored to different levels of accuracy, such as spatial or temporal subsets of UE location information.

It is important to note that reporting current UE location can lead to additional signaling and load in the NG-RAN and AMF, so consumers retrieving data from AMF should use current location information judiciously to avoid excessive signaling.","The answer should cover the types of data NWDAF collects for redundant transmission experience and UE mobility. It should mention the sources of data (OAM, 5GC, AFs, NF), the specific types of information collected (UE location, trends, access behavior, service data), and reference the relevant tables (6.68.2-1, 6.68.2-2, 6.7.2.2-1, 6.7.2.2-2).

"Describe the measurement methods for transmitted carrier power in UTRAN cells in TDD mode, including both mean and maximum values.","The measurement methods for transmitted carrier power in UTRAN cells operating in TDD mode involve determining both the mean and maximum values of the transmitted carrier power. 

For the mean transmitted carrier power, the measurement is obtained by sampling the transmitted carrier power of the same Node B at a pre-defined interval and then calculating the arithmetic mean. This measurement is valid for time slots (TS) ranging from TS0 to TS14, with TS0 to TS6 being applicable to both UtranCellTDDLcr and UtranCellTDDHcr, and TS7 to TS14 being valid only for UtranCellTDDHcr. When a TS is configured for downlink, the measurement value is an integer ranging from 0 to 100, representing the percentage of the measured transmitted carrier power. If a TS is configured for uplink, the measurement is not valid and should have a NULL value. This measurement is applicable to both circuit switched and packet switched traffic.

For the maximum transmitted carrier power, the measurement is obtained by sampling the transmitted carrier power of the same Node B at a pre-defined interval and then determining the maximum value. Similar to the mean measurement, this is valid for time slots (TS) ranging from TS0 to TS14, with TS0 to TS6 being applicable to both UtranCellTDDLcr and UtranCellTDDHcr, and TS7 to TS14 being valid only for UtranCellTDDHcr.

Describe the information flow and procedures for group status notification in MC service as specified in TS 23.280.,"The information flow for group status notification in MC service is detailed in Table 10.7.2.12-1 of TS 23.280. This table outlines the process by which the MC service server communicates the status of a group to the MC service client. Specifically, the MC service server, such as an MCPTT server, may use the MBMS bearer to inform affiliated clients about the status of a group communication, indicating whether a group call is ongoing or not, especially when the call is set up on unicast bearers. This group status information is crucial for clients who need to perform late entry into chat group calls or rejoin calls, as it helps them decide whether to join the calls. The procedures for transmitting the group status notification are described in clause 10.7.3.4, which can be used in conjunction with the information flows specified in subclause 10.7.2.12 for comprehensive understanding.","The answer should include the detailed information flow for group status notification from the MC service server to the MC service client as described in Table 10.7.2.12-1. It should also cover the procedures for transmission of group status notification, including the use of MBMS bearer for informing the status of group communication, and how this information is utilized by affiliated clients for late entry or rejoin calls. Additionally, it should reference subclause 10.7.2.12 for further details."
Describe the time synchronization modes and timestamping requirements for (g)PTP messages in a 5G system as specified in 3GPP TS 24.535.,"In a 5G system (5GS), time synchronization can be configured to operate in one of the following modes: a time-aware system, a boundary clock, a peer-to-peer transparent clock, or an end-to-end transparent clock. For a time-aware system, the 5GS needs to support the implementation of (g)PTP requirements as per IEEE Std 802.1AS. For the other three modes (boundary clock, peer-to-peer transparent clock, and end-to-end transparent clock), the 5GS needs to support the implementation of PTP requirements according to IEEE Std 1588-2019. Within a 5GS, (g)PTP messages are delivered over the user plane, with specific requirements for the DS-TT and NW-TT in terms of the signaling of ingress time.

The ingress timestamp (TSi) for a (g)PTP event message is conveyed by the ingress TT, which creates a Suffix field with TSi encoded as specified. For a gPTP message, if the ingress TT is a NW-TT, support for these operations is mandatory, whereas for a DS-TT, support is optional. For a PTP message, support for these operations is optional for both NW-TT and DS-TT.

The egress TT creates an egress timestamp (TSe) for every (g)PTP event message and uses TSi from the Suffix field to calculate the residence time. For a gPTP message, if the egress TT is a NW-TT, support for these operations is optional, whereas for a DS-TT, support is mandatory. For a PTP message, support for these operations is optional for both NW-TT and DS-TT.

Organization-specific TLV extensions are included in the Suffix field of a (g)PTP message, coded as specified in IEEE Std 1588-2019. The Suffix field is shown in figure 5.3.1.1 and table 5.3.1.1, with the value of the OUI for 3GPP needing to be assigned by the IEEE.","The answer must include the different modes of time synchronization in a 5G system, the requirements for ingress and egress timestamping for (g)PTP and PTP messages, and the coding of the Suffix field with organization-specific TLV extensions. It should also mention the mandatory and optional support for NW-TT and DS-TT in various scenarios."
"Describe the procedures and checks performed by the VLR during various types of requests from the MS, including outgoing requests, location registration requests, and handling of TMSI after VLR restart.","The Visitor Location Register (VLR) performs several procedures and checks during different types of requests from the Mobile Station (MS). These include outgoing requests, location registration requests, and handling of Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) after VLR restart.

For outgoing requests, such as MS originated calls, mobile originated short messages, or call-independent supplementary service activities, the VLR checks its IMSI record for the MS. If the MS is unknown or the IMSI record is marked 'Subscriber Data Not Confirmed by HLR,' the request is rejected with the error cause 'Unidentified Subscriber,' prompting the MS to initiate the location registration procedure. If the IMSI record is marked 'Subscriber Data Confirmed by HLR,' the request is handled normally, and after necessary authentication and/or IMEI checking, the record is marked 'Confirmed by Radio Contact.' The VLR then checks the 'Location Information Confirmed in HLR' indicator and performs an 'Update Location' procedure to the HLR if needed. For roaming MS, the VLR also checks 'Subscriber Data Confirmed by CSS' and 'Location Information Confirmed by CSS' indicators and performs an 'Update VCSG Location' procedure to the CSS if required.

For location registration requests, such as location updating or IMSI attach, the VLR checks its IMSI record for the MS. If the MS is unknown, the VLR creates a skeleton IMSI record and sets several indicators to 'Not Confirmed.' After authentication, the VLR sets the 'Confirmed by Radio Contact' indicator to 'Confirmed' and performs an 'Update Location' to the HLR. If successful, the indicators 'Location Information Confirmed in HLR' and 'Subscriber Data Confirmed by HLR' are set to 'Confirmed.' If the VPLMN supports Autonomous CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled it, the VLR may perform an 'Update VCSG Location' to the CSS for CSG/hybrid cells, setting the relevant indicators to 'Confirmed' if successful.

After the VLR has restarted, the TMSI known by the MS is invalid until the next authenticated radio contact. The VLR uses the IMSI to identify the MS during the first radio contact. If an MS identifies itself by a TMSI in a location registration request, the VLR checks the location area identity (LAI) of the previous location area. If the LAI is in a different VLR, the request is handled normally. If the LAI is in the current VLR, the status of the TMSI is checked. If the TMSI was allocated after the VLR restarted and corresponds to a valid IMSI record, the request is handled as described for location registration requests. If the TMSI was allocated before the VLR restarted or does not correspond to a valid IMSI record, the VLR requests the IMSI from the MS and proceeds accordingly. If the MS does not return an IMSI, the network aborts the procedure.

Similarly, if an MS identifies itself by a TMSI in an outgoing request, the VLR checks the status of the TMSI. If the TMSI was allocated after the VLR restarted and corresponds to a valid IMSI record, the request is handled as described for outgoing requests. If the TMSI was allocated before the VLR restarted or does not correspond to a valid IMSI record, the VLR requests the IMSI from the MS and proceeds accordingly. If the MS does not return an IMSI, the network aborts the outgoing request.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- For outgoing requests, the VLR checks the IMSI record status and performs necessary updates to HLR and CSS if required.
- For location registration requests, the VLR creates skeleton IMSI records if the MS is unknown, performs authentication, and updates HLR and CSS.
- After VLR restart, the VLR uses IMSI to identify the MS and handles requests based on the status of TMSI, including procedures for location registration and outgoing requests."
Describe the procedures and conditions under which an MGW (Media Gateway) communicates its availability and performs re-registration with a (G)MSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Center) server according to 3GPP TS 23.205.,"According to 3GPP TS 23.205, the MGW (Media Gateway) communicates its availability to the (G)MSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Center) server through specific messages and procedures. When the MGW is available, it sends an MGW Communication Up message or an MGW Restoration message to the (G)MSC server. If the (G)MSC server does not wish to maintain an association with the MGW, it may respond with an alternative MGCId signalling address, prompting the MGW to attempt re-registration with the alternative MGC before considering other options. If no alternative address is provided, the MGW remains registered with the current (G)MSC server.

Upon discovering MGW availability, the following procedures occur:

1. **Signalling Recovery**: The MGW indicates to all connected (G)MSC servers that the signalling connection is restored. Any changes to the physical termination state during the communication loss are reported using Termination Out Of Service or Termination Restoration procedures. To avoid unsuccessful calls due to unreported physical terminations going out of service, the (G)MSC server may audit the physical terminations before using them, although this may cause duplicate signalling.

2. **MGW Restoration/Maintenance Unlocking Indication**: The MGW informs all connected (G)MSC servers that normal operation has resumed. Changes in the physical termination state during the connection break are reported using Termination Out Of Service and Termination Restoration procedures. The (G)MSC server may audit the physical terminations before using them to avoid unsuccessful calls.

3. **Recognition of MGW Functionality**: The (G)MSC server recognizes that the MGW is functioning correctly, often through replies to periodic audits. The server can then use the MGW, sending unblocked messages to concerned nodes for devices in service based on the actual state determined by Termination Restoration procedures or audits.

If none of these steps occur, the (G)MSC server can initiate the (G)MSC Server Ordered Re-register procedure.

For re-registration, when the (G)MSC requests the MGW to perform registration, the MGW re-registers to the (G)MSC defined in the address. If the (G)MSC server is uncertain about the termination service state of physical terminations after re-registration, it uses the Audit Procedure. Changes in the physical termination state during the connection break are reported using Termination Out Of Service and Termination Restoration procedures.

For detailed procedures, refer to clauses 10.2 and 10.5 of 3GPP TS 23.205.","The answer must include:
  - Detailed explanation of the MGW communication up and restoration messages.
  - Description of signalling recovery and maintenance unlocking indication procedures.
  - Steps taken by the (G)MSC server upon discovering MGW availability, including auditing procedures.
  - Explanation of the re-registration process and conditions under which it is performed.
  - References to the relevant clauses in 3GPP TS 23.205 for further details."
"Describe the performance and implementation challenges of square 16QAM modulation and Turbo coding schemes (HOMTC) as compared to EGPRS, and discuss the considerations for using 16QAM in different channel environments.","Square 16QAM modulation and Turbo coding schemes (HOMTC) have shown significantly improved performance compared to EGPRS. However, there are several practical implementation challenges associated with square 16QAM. One major issue is the higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is about 2dB higher than that of 8PSK. This higher PAPR necessitates a larger backoff of the power amplifier (PA) at maximum output power, affecting coverage areas in noise-limited environments. Additionally, the higher backoff can cause issues when using 16QAM on the BCCH channel.

Another challenge is the dynamic range of square 16QAM modulation, which reaches 40dB. This requires a wider linearity range in the RF front end, making it more difficult to implement on legacy base transceiver stations (BTSs). A comparison of circular 16APK constellations to square 16QAM is presented in subclause 8.7, which provides further insights into the performance differences.

The evaluation of these modulation schemes was conducted in a co-channel interference limited environment, considering a typical urban channel with a mobile speed of 3 km/h at a 900 MHz carrier frequency. Single transmit and receive antenna receivers were used, along with a linearised GMSK pulse shaping filter with a BT product of 0.3. It is important to note that blind detection for different modulation schemes was not considered in the simulations; it was assumed that the modulation scheme used in the transmitter was known by the receiver. An evaluation of blind detection performance can be found in subclause 8.7a.","The answer should cover the improved performance of square 16QAM modulation and Turbo coding schemes (HOMTC) compared to EGPRS, highlighting the higher PAPR and its impact on PA backoff and coverage areas. It should discuss the dynamic range and linearity requirements for RF front end implementation, especially on legacy BTSs. Additionally, the answer should include the comparison with circular 16APK constellations as detailed in subclause 8.7. The evaluation conditions such as co-channel interference, typical urban channel, mobile speed, carrier frequency, antenna configuration, pulse shaping filter, and assumptions about modulation scheme detection should also be addressed."

1. **Overview of MA PDU Session Establishment:**
   MA PDU session establishment is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and efficient data flow management across both 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks. It involves the coordination of various network functions such as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), Policy Control Function (PCF), and Charging Function (CHF).

Describe the process and conditions under which the IRPAgent emits the notifyHeartbeat notification according to 3GPP TS 32.352.,"The IRPAgent emits the notifyHeartbeat notification under specific conditions as outlined in 3GPP TS 32.352. Firstly, the IRPManager must invoke an operation to solicit the notifyHeartbeat notification. Before doing so, the IRPManager should ensure it has subscribed to the notifyHeartbeat notification. Upon successful completion of this operation, the IRPAgent will emit the notifyHeartbeat notification immediately. The notification can be sent either to the soliciting IRPManager or to each of the subscribed IRPManagers, depending on system performance considerations. If the operation fails, the notification will not be emitted.

Additionally, the IRPManager can invoke an operation to set the heartbeatPeriod. If this operation is successful, the IRPAgent will emit the notifyHeartbeat notification immediately and continue to emit it based on the newly specified heartbeatPeriod to all established notification subscriptions of all subscribed IRPManagers. However, if the specified heartbeatPeriod is the same as the current value in the IRPAgent, the operation will fail. These conditions ensure that the notifyHeartbeat notification is managed efficiently and only emitted under appropriate circumstances.","The answer should cover the conditions under which the IRPAgent emits the notifyHeartbeat notification, including the requirement for the IRPManager to subscribe to the notification, the immediate emission upon successful operation, the options for notification recipients based on system performance, and the impact of setting the heartbeatPeriod. It should also mention the failure conditions for both operations."
"Explain the classification and handling of bits in AMR codec frames, including the role of CRC and the specific handling of comfort noise bits.","In AMR codec frames, bits are classified into three classes based on their importance and sensitivity to errors: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A bits are the most sensitive to errors, and any error in these bits typically results in a corrupted speech frame that should not be decoded without appropriate error concealment. These bits are protected by a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) generated using the polynomial G(x)=D8 + D6 + D5 + D4 + 1, which is computed over all Class A bits of the AMR Core Frame. The CRC field is included in the AMR frame unless the Frame Type Index is 15.

Class B and Class C bits are less sensitive to errors compared to Class A bits. Errors in Class B bits gradually reduce speech quality, but decoding of an erroneous speech frame is usually possible without annoying artifacts. Class C bits are the least sensitive to errors, and errors in these bits have the least impact on speech quality.

For comfort noise bits, which are used in Source Controlled Rate Operation, all bits are mapped to Class A, and Classes B and C are not used. This classification is a notation convention and has no practical meaning for comfort noise bits. The comfort noise bits are divided into three parts: SID Type Indicator (STI), Mode Indication (mi(i)), and Comfort Noise Parameters (s(i)). The bits are mapped in a specific order, with the comfort noise parameter bits followed by the SID Type Indicator and Mode Indication bits.

In summary, the handling of bits in AMR codec frames involves generating a CRC for error detection, classifying bits based on their importance and sensitivity to errors, and specifically mapping comfort noise bits for SID_UPDATE and SID_FIRST frames.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role and generation of CRC in AMR codec frames, including the polynomial used and the conditions for its inclusion.
  - The classification of bits into Classes A, B, and C, their importance, and how errors affect each class.
  - The specific handling of comfort noise bits, their classification, and the bit mapping for SID_UPDATE and SID_FIRST frames."
"Describe the Closed User Group (CUG) service as defined in 3GPP TS 22.085, including its key features, subscription options, and handling of roaming scenarios.","The Closed User Group (CUG) service, as defined in 3GPP TS 22.085, is a supplementary service that allows a group of subscribers to communicate with each other while restricting communication with non-members. Each member of a CUG is identified by an ISDN/MSISDN number. A CUG can be defined for one or more basic service groups, and members can have capabilities that allow them to originate and receive calls outside the group, as well as restrictions that prevent them from making or receiving calls within the group.

When CUG members roam to Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) that support CUG, their CUG facilities remain unaffected, ensuring they have the same capabilities as on their Home PLMN. However, when roaming to networks that do not support CUG, the Home PLMN controls the handling of roaming without relying on extra functionality in the visited network. In such cases, specific rules apply:
1. For basic service groups not subject to CUG restrictions, incoming and outgoing calls are allowed as normal.
2. For basic service groups with CUG restrictions and without incoming access, incoming calls are not allowed.
3. For basic service groups with CUG restrictions and without outgoing access, outgoing calls are not allowed.
4. Normal incoming calls are allowed for basic service groups with CUG restrictions if the called user has incoming access.
5. Outgoing calls are allowed for basic service groups with CUG restrictions if the user has outgoing access.

A subscriber can be a member of up to 10 CUGs. The CUG service is provided after prior arrangement with the service provider, and subscription options must be selected by the subscriber. The subscription options for each basic service group include:
- CUG calls only
- CUG with incoming access (can receive calls not subject to CUG restrictions)
- CUG with outgoing access (can make calls not subject to CUG restrictions)
- CUG with incoming and outgoing access (can make and receive calls not subject to CUG restrictions)

Additionally, subscribers can choose restrictions such as barring incoming or outgoing calls within a CUG. The network provides a subscription option to specify a preferential CUG for each basic service group included in at least one CUG. This preferential CUG can be altered only by the service provider upon the user's request. If a user has the subscription option to bar outgoing calls within a CUG, they cannot specify that CUG as a preferential CUG.","The answer should include the definition of CUG and how members are identified, the capabilities and restrictions for CUG members, the impact of roaming on CUG services, and the maximum number of CUGs a subscriber can be part of. It should also cover the handling of roaming in networks not supporting CUG, detailing the rules for incoming and outgoing calls. Additionally, the answer should explain the subscription options available for CUG services, including the different types of access and restrictions, the concept of preferential CUG, and how subscription options can be altered."
"Explain the encoding and handling of Fully Qualified Cause (F-Cause) in GTPv2 messages, including the differences in encoding for RANAP, BSSGP, and S1-AP causes.","The Fully Qualified Cause (F-Cause) field in GTPv2 messages is encoded to indicate the specific cause of an event or condition, with different encoding methods for RANAP, BSSGP, and S1-AP causes.

For RANAP Cause, the F-Cause field contains a non-transparent copy of the cause value from the corresponding IE, as defined in TS 25.413. The value of the F-Cause field ranges from 1 to 512 and is transferred over the Iu interface, encoded into two octets as a binary integer. The Cause Type field is ignored by the receiver.

For BSSGP Cause, the F-Cause field contains a non-transparent copy of the cause value from the corresponding IE, as defined in TS 48.018. The value of the F-Cause field ranges from 0 to 255 and is transferred over the Gb interface, encoded into one octet as a binary integer. The Cause Type field is ignored by the receiver.

For S1-AP Cause, the F-Cause field contains a non-transparent copy of the cause value from the corresponding IE, as defined in TS 36.413. The Cause Type field contains the RAN Cause subcategory, encoded as specified in Table 8.49-1 of TS 29.274. The value of the F-Cause field, along with the associated RAN cause subcategory, is transferred over the S1-AP interface and encoded into one octet as a binary integer.

Transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters across GTPv2 interfaces involves copying the respective information into one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE without impacting GTPv2 if the contents of such parameters change over time. Non-transparent copying involves decoding the ASN.1/PER parameter and encoding the value(s) into one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE as specified in the document.

"Describe the procedure for canceling a regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group, including the preconditions and steps involved.","The procedure for canceling a regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group involves several preconditions and steps. 

Preconditions:
1. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 have been regrouped into an MCPTT regroup group.
2. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
3. The Group Management Server (GMS) has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MCPTT server using the procedures defined in TS 23.280.

Steps involved in the cancellation process:
1. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the cancellation of the regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
2. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT server, specifying the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group.
3. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that uses a preconfigured group regroup procedure.
4. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel requests to MCPTT clients 2 and 3.
5. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the group regrouping.
6. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the cancellation of the regrouping function. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup cancel request.
7. The MCPTT server de-affiliates MCPTT clients 2 and 3 from the MCPTT regroup group.

"Describe the process and key parameters involved in the RPE-LTP coding as specified in TS 46.010, including the Schur recursion and scaling operations.","The RPE-LTP coder operates on a frame-by-frame basis, with each frame consisting of 160 samples. The coding process involves two main sets of procedures: those executed once per frame and those executed four times per frame for each sub-segment of 40 samples.

Procedures 5.2.0 to 5.2.10 are performed once per frame to produce the LARc[1..8] parameters, which are the coded LAR coefficients. These procedures also handle the inverse filtering operation for the entire frame of 160 samples. The output parameters from these procedures are:
- LARc[1..8]: Coded LAR coefficients

Procedures 5.2.11 to 5.2.18 are executed four times per frame, once for each sub-segment of 40 samples. The output parameters from these procedures are:
- Nc: LTP lag
- bc: Coded LTP gain
- Mc: RPE grid selection
- xmaxc: Coded maximum amplitude of the RPE sequence
- xMc[0..12]: Codes of the normalized RPE samples

The Schur recursion process, detailed in procedure 5.2.5, involves several steps:
1. Initialization of arrays P[..] and K[..].
2. Computation of reflection coefficients using the normalized autocorrelation function (ACF).
3. Integer division operation to compute the reflection coefficients.

Test Purpose:
The purpose of this test is to ensure that the NR PSCell activation and deactivation delay under EN-DC are within the specified requirements. This is particularly relevant when the UE is configured with one deactivated SCG and the PSCell in one SCG is being activated, where the PSCell is known by the UE at the time of activation.

Describe the procedures and state transitions involved in the establishment and release of an MCVideo call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.581.,"The establishment and release of an MCVideo call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.581 involve several key procedures and state transitions. 

During the call establishment, new instances of the 'Transmission participant state transition diagram for basic transmission control operation' and the 'Transmission participant state transition diagram for basic reception control operation' are created. These diagrams are essential for managing the transmission and reception control operations throughout the call. The SIP INVITE request sent by the application and signalling plane plays a crucial role in this process. It is considered an implicit Transmission request if such a request is negotiated during the call setup. However, it is not regarded as an implicit Transmission request if it pertains to rejoining an already ongoing group call. Additionally, the transmission participant can negotiate the prioritization of the Transmission Media Request message, allowing them to request permission to send media at a priority level that is either the same as or lower than the highest priority permitted during the MCVideo call initialization. If authorized for pre-emptive priority, it is advisable for the transmission participant to request permission to send RTP media packets at a lower priority level unless explicitly requesting to pre-empt the current sender.

The release of an MCVideo call is a two-step procedure. In the first step, the transmission participant stops sending transmission control and reception control messages, and the MCVideo client ceases sending and receiving RTP media packets. In the second step, once the application and signalling plane has determined that the MCVideo call is released, the corresponding instances of the 'Transmission participant state transition diagram for basic transmission control operation' and the 'Transmission participant state transition diagram for basic reception control operation' are terminated, and the transmission participant releases all used resources. While the user plane can initiate the first step of the release, the application and signalling plane always initiates the second step.

Overall, the procedures and state transitions ensure a structured approach to managing MCVideo calls, from establishment to release, with specific roles and actions defined for both the transmission participant and the transmission control server.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of the creation and role of state transition diagrams for transmission and reception control operations during MCVideo call establishment.

How should the SAN tester be configured and what are the throughput requirements for PUSCH testing according to 3GPP TS 38.181?,"To configure the SAN tester for PUSCH testing according to 3GPP TS 38.181, follow these steps:

1. Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators, and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for SAN type 1-H.
2. Adjust the AWGN generator according to the channel bandwidth defined in table 8.2.1.4.2-1.
3. Configure the characteristics of the wanted signal according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.1.4.2-2.

5. Adjust the equipment so that the required SNR specified in tables 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-4 is achieved at the SAN input.
6. For each of the reference channels in tables 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-4 applicable for the base station, measure the throughput.

The throughput measured according to clause 8.2.1.4.2 should not be below the limits for the SNR levels specified in the following tables:

- Table 8.2.1.5-4: Test requirements for PUSCH with 70% of maximum throughput, Type B, 10 MHz channel bandwidth, 30 kHz SCS

Additionally, the minimum throughput requirements for SNR levels are specified in the following tables:

- Table 8.2.4.5-1: Minimum requirements for PUSCH, Type A, 5 MHz channel bandwidth, 15 kHz SCS

"Describe the concept of the '(n-1) out of n' approach as defined in TS 32.404 Annex A, and explain how it can be applied in the context of measurement results in network elements.","The '(n-1) out of n' approach, as defined in TS 32.404 Annex A, is a method that allows vendors to implement a subset of 3GPP defined measurements. This approach is particularly useful when measurement result values generated by a Network Element (NE) are often redundant, or the information contained in the measurement results can be obtained in multiple ways. For example, if there exists a relation such as A + B = C, then any two out of the three defined measurements (A, B, C) are sufficient to calculate the third measurement (n=3). Similarly, if there is a relation like A + B + C = D, then any three out of the four measurements would suffice.

This approach can be applied in the context of measurement results in network elements by allowing flexibility in the implementation of measurement collection and reporting. According to TS 32.405 section 4.1, the general principles of measurement collection and reporting in network elements involve ensuring that the collected data is accurate and reliable. TS 32.405 section 4.4 provides specific guidelines on the types of measurements that can be collected and how they should be reported, ensuring that the necessary data is available for network performance analysis.

Furthermore, TS 32.406 section 4.5 outlines procedures for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of measurement results, which is crucial when using the '(n-1) out of n' approach. This includes methods for validating and cross-checking measurement results to ensure consistency and correctness, as detailed in TS 32.406 section 4.6.1. By implementing these procedures, vendors can ensure that even with a subset of measurements, the derived values are accurate and reliable, thus maintaining the integrity of network performance data.","The answer should include a clear definition of the '(n-1) out of n' approach, examples from TS 32.404 Annex A, and a discussion on how this approach can be applied to measurement results in network elements.

Describe the throttling mechanism for downlink data notification requests in idle mode as specified in TS 23.214 5.9.3.4.,"The throttling mechanism for downlink data notification requests in idle mode, as specified in TS 23.214 5.9.3.4, involves several key steps and components. Firstly, the MME/SGSN can request the SGWs to selectively reduce the number of downlink data notification requests for non-priority traffic received for UEs in idle mode. This reduction is based on a throttling factor and a throttling delay specified in the Downlink Data Notification Acknowledgement (DDN Ack) message.

The SGW-C plays a crucial role in handling this throttling mechanism. Upon receiving a DDN Ack from the MME/SGSN, the SGW-C determines which bearers are subject to throttling based on the bearer's Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level and the operator's policy. When the SGW-C receives an Sx report indicating the arrival of downlink data packets on these bearers, it decides whether to send a DDN to the MME based on the requested throttling factor. Additionally, the SGW-C may indicate in the Sx Report Acknowledgement whether the SGW-U should discard the buffered packet and whether it should notify when additional downlink packets arrive.

It is important to note that the throttling delay timer and throttling factor are managed by the SGW-C and are not provided to the SGW-U. This ensures that the SGW-C has control over the throttling process and can make decisions based on the operator's policy and the priority level of the traffic.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the classification and handling of traffic frames in the context of 3GPP TS 46.081, including the roles of BFI, SID, and TAF flags.","In the context of 3GPP TS 46.081, the classification and handling of traffic frames are managed by the RX DTX handler, which receives traffic frames from the RSS. These frames are individually marked by various pre-processing functions with three flags: the Bad Frame Indicator (BFI) flag, the Silence Descriptor (SID) flag, and the Time Alignment Flag (TAF). 

The BFI flag is binary and indicates whether the traffic frame contains meaningful information bits (BFI flag = '0') or not (BFI flag = '1'). For example, a FACCH frame is considered not to contain meaningful bits and is marked with BFI flag = '1'. The performance requirements for the BFI flag are specified in GSM 05.05.

The SID flag is ternary and is determined by the SID frame detector, which compares the relevant bits of the received traffic frame with the SID code word defined in GSM 06.62. The SID flag is coded based on the number of bit deviations (n) as follows:
- SID = 2 when n < 2
- SID = 1 when 2 ≤ n < 16
- SID = 0 when n ≥ 16

The TAF flag is binary and marks traffic frames that are aligned with the SACCH multiframe structure, with TAF = '1' indicating alignment. This alignment is described in GSM 05.08.

These flags serve to classify the traffic frames according to the criteria summarized in table 1 of TS 46.081, allowing the RX DTX handler to determine how each received frame should be processed.","The answer should include the process of how received traffic frames are handled by the RX DTX handler, the significance of the BFI, SID, and TAF flags in classifying these frames, and the specific conditions under which each flag is set. It should also reference the relevant tables and clauses for detailed classification criteria."
Describe the methods and benefits of reducing latency in 3GPP networks as outlined in TS 45.912.,"The methods and benefits of reducing latency in 3GPP networks as outlined in TS 45.912 include several approaches. Firstly, the latency for a TCP ACK can be reduced by 10ms, which applies cumulatively to every TCP ACK sent in a TCP session. This reduction can also be achieved for small RTP or IP packets, especially when using header compression, where 40 ms of G.729 VoIP data could be transmitted in 2 bursts using MCS 7, 8, or 9. Additionally, the use of incremental redundancy within the complete radio block makes such transmissions more robust than if sent using legacy bit mapping.

Furthermore, VSRB can be combined with multiple frequency/multislot operation, where N RLC frames are sent in a single RLC period, assuming N slots are used. During the final RLC block period of a transmission, only a subset of the N available RLC frames may be needed for data, with the remaining frames containing redundancy information. This combination allows for earlier decoding of the final RLC frame, advancing the decode time by 5 ms compared to pure dual-frequency without VSRB, 5 ms compared to pure VSRB without dual-frequency, and 15 ms compared to legacy mobiles. 

In summary, the steps to reduce latency include reducing the TTI of each RLC frame to 10ms (if two frequencies are used) or 5 ms (if four frequencies are used), and using VSRB coding during the final RLC block period to bring forward the decode time.","The answer should include the methods of reducing latency such as reducing the latency for TCP ACK by 10ms, using header compression for small RTP or IP packets, and incremental redundancy for robust transmissions. It should also cover the combination of VSRB with multiple frequency/multislot operation, reducing TTI of each RLC frame, and using VSRB coding during the final RLC block period. Additionally, the specific latency reductions achieved compared to legacy mobiles should be mentioned."
Describe the process and key elements involved in notifying the VAL server with monitoring events related to VAL UE(s) as per 3GPP TS 23.434.,"The process of notifying the VAL server with monitoring events related to VAL UE(s) involves the use of the API operation named Notify_Monitoring_Events. This operation is designed to inform the VAL server about monitoring events that are pertinent to VAL UE(s). The information flow for this notification process is detailed in Table 14.3.2.19-1, which outlines the communication from the NRM server to the VAL server upon the occurrence of monitoring events.

The known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server, which receives the notifications. The inputs required for this operation are specified in subclause 14.3.2.19, which provides a comprehensive description of the necessary data elements.

Explain the use and configuration of HTTP/2 Server Push in NF Service communication as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 and TS 29.501.,"HTTP/2 Server Push is a mechanism that may be supported and used by a NF Service Producer to proactively push resources to a NF Service Consumer. According to 3GPP TS 29.500, a NF Service Consumer can disable HTTP/2 Server Push by setting the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH parameter to 0, as specified in clause 8.2 of IETF RFC 7540.

In 3GPP TS 29.501, it is detailed that HTTP/2 Server Push can be used if it is supported in the PLMN. The NF Service Producer utilizes PUSH_PROMISE frames in the HTTP response, where each frame contains a GET request targeting the URI of one resource to be transferred and the reserved stream identifier for transferring the resource. Subsequently, the NF Service Producer sends Push Responses via the corresponding reserved streams, each containing the representation of the associated resource. Additionally, links with the URIs of the resources are sent in DATA frames of the response message.

The sequence of steps for indirect delivery with HTTP/2 Server Push is as follows:
1. The NF Service Consumer sends an HTTP request to the NF Service Producer to get resources, such as querying a collection of resources.
2. The NF Service Producer detects multiple resources to be returned and chooses to deliver them indirectly using the Server Push mechanism.
3. The NF Service Producer returns multiple PUSH_PROMISE requests before the HEADERS frame and DATA frames to the NF Service Consumer. Each PUSH_PROMISE request contains the URI of one resource to be transferred and the identifier of the reserved stream used for transferring the resource. Links with the URIs of the resources are also sent in DATA frames of the response message.
4. The NF Service Producer sends Push Responses via corresponding reserved streams, each containing the representation of the associated resource.
5. If the NF Service Consumer does not successfully receive a resource in time, it may send a request to get that resource using the previously received resource URI from the Push Request.
6. The NF Service Producer returns the data of the requested resource in the response.

Overall, HTTP/2 Server Push allows for efficient resource delivery from the NF Service Producer to the NF Service Consumer, with the option for the consumer to disable the push mechanism if desired.","The answer should include the conditions under which HTTP/2 Server Push can be used, the mechanism of sending PUSH_PROMISE frames and Push Responses, and the method for disabling HTTP/2 Server Push. It should also describe the sequence of steps for indirect delivery with HTTP/2 Server Push, including the roles of NF Service Producer and NF Service Consumer."
How does a TP UE initiate and respond to an IM session supporting telepresence according to 3GPP TS 24.103 specifications?,"To initiate an IM session supporting telepresence, the TP UE must generate an SDP offer in the SIP request. This offer should include basic media streams and a request to establish a DTLS/SCTP association for a CLUE data channel. The SDP offer must negotiate port and transport information for the DTLS/SCTP association using a separate SDP 'm=' line with a UDP/DTLS/SCTP or TCP/DTLS/SCTP proto value, along with SDP attributes such as 'tls-id', 'sctp-port', 'max-message-size', and 'dcmap' to indicate 'CLUE' as the application protocol. The procedures for establishing the DTLS/SCTP association are detailed in IETF RFC 8841, RFC 8842, and RFC 8850.

If the TP UE receives a SIP response without the '+sip.clue' Contact header field parameter or an SDP answer without support information for DTLS/SCTP establishment, the session will revert to a normal IM session. In point-to-point cases, CLUE negotiation can be initiated via the first SDP offer/answer or during an ongoing IM session, depending on local configuration. The 'max-message-size' attribute in the SDP can indicate the maximum message size, with a value of zero meaning the SCTP endpoint will handle messages of any size, subject to memory capacity.

Only a single CLUE data channel is established within the same IM session supporting telepresence. Once connected, the TP UE must trigger an updated SDP offer/answer exchange to set up media streams for transmitting media captures as negotiated. When constructing the SDP offer, the TP UE should add a corresponding 'm=' line for each encoding defined in CLUE messages, using an associated 'label' attribute to identify each encoding. The 'm=' lines should be marked as send-only or inactive to represent the sender's encoding abilities and policies. Additionally, an SDP 'group' session-level attribute should signal that the 'm=' lines are CLUE-controlled.

When responding to a SIP request to initiate an IM session supporting telepresence, the TP UE must send an SDP answer with information for CLUE data channel establishment, including the necessary SDP attributes. If the receiving UE does not support DTLS/SCTP, it should reject the request by setting the port number to zero in the 'm=' line describing the DTLS/SCTP association. The session will then proceed as a normal IM session. Once the CLUE data channel is connected, the TP UE must perform an updated SDP offer/answer exchange to set up media streams for transmission of media captures.

In conference scenarios, a TP UE acting as a conference participant must follow the same steps to set up an IM session supporting telepresence, both when initiating and responding to requests.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Steps for TP UE to initiate an IM session supporting telepresence, including SDP offer generation and DTLS/SCTP association setup.
  - Handling of SIP responses indicating lack of CLUE support.
  - Procedures for constructing SDP offers for media streams and CLUE data channel.

"Describe the procedures for on-network remotely initiated group calls as specified in TS 24.379, including the roles of different MCPTT users and groups.","The procedures for on-network remotely initiated group calls as specified in TS 24.379 involve several key roles and actions. Clause 10.1.5 outlines the general procedures for these calls, which include the actions taken by the MCPTT client, participating MCPTT function, and controlling MCPTT function.

In more detail, Clause 10.1.5.1 defines specific terms used in these procedures:
- The 'requesting MCPTT user' is the user who sends a request to initiate a remotely initiated group call.
- The 'remote MCPTT user' is the user who receives the request to initiate the group call.
- The 'targeted MCPTT group' refers to the group that is intended to be called in the remotely initiated group call.

Clause 10.1.5.2 further specifies the procedures for the MCPTT client, participating MCPTT function, and controlling MCPTT function. The MCPTT client is responsible for sending and receiving requests and responses related to the group call. The participating MCPTT function handles the participation of users in the group call, ensuring that the call is properly managed and maintained. The controlling MCPTT function oversees the overall control and coordination of the group call, ensuring that all users and functions are synchronized and that the call proceeds smoothly.

Overall, these procedures ensure that remotely initiated group calls are effectively managed and that all participants understand their roles and responsibilities.","The answer should include a summary of the procedures for on-network remotely initiated group calls, clearly defining the roles of the 'requesting MCPTT user', 'remote MCPTT user', and 'targeted MCPTT group'.

"Describe the behavior and limitations of the Call Hold service as specified in 3GPP TS 22.083, including interactions with the Call Waiting Supplementary Service.","The Call Hold service, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.083, allows a served user to interrupt communication on the traffic channel and release it from the existing call. The traffic channel is reserved for the user invoking the Call Hold service, and only one call can be held at a time. If the user has a call on hold and no active call, they can retrieve the held call, set up another call, or disconnect the held call. However, they cannot receive a new call unless they are using the Call Waiting Supplementary Service.

If the user has an active call and another call on hold, they can alternate between the two calls, disconnect the active call, disconnect the held call, or disconnect both calls. In this scenario, the user cannot receive a new call. The network can offer incoming calls even if the user has an active call and a call on hold, but the user cannot accept the new call as long as they have one active call and one call on hold. Incoming calls are offered as waiting calls if the user has a call on hold and no active call.

Describe the differences between the handling of 'short' TMSI and 'long' TMSI as defined in TS 31.121.,"The Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) is used for the temporary identification of the User Equipment (UE) by UTRAN or GERAN and is assigned by the network. It is stored in the USIM by the Terminal and read during the USIM-Terminal initialization procedure. According to TS 31.121, there are two types of TMSI handling: 'short' TMSI and 'long' TMSI.

The 'short' TMSI refers to the handling of a TMSI with leading zeros. This type of TMSI is tested to ensure that the system correctly processes TMSIs that include leading zeros. The term 'short' TMSI is used to distinguish these tests from others.

On the other hand, the 'long' TMSI refers to the handling of a newly assigned TMSI. This type of TMSI is tested to ensure that the system correctly processes newly assigned TMSIs without any leading zeros. The term 'long' TMSI is used to differentiate these tests from those involving 'short' TMSIs.

In summary, the main difference between 'short' TMSI and 'long' TMSI lies in the presence of leading zeros in the former and the handling of newly assigned TMSIs in the latter during the USIM-Terminal initialization procedure.","The answer should cover the definition and usage of TMSI in the context of UE identification by UTRAN/GERAN, the storage and reading process during USIM-Terminal initialization, and the distinction between 'short' TMSI (handling of TMSI with leading zeros) and 'long' TMSI (handling of newly assigned TMSI)."

Describe the requirements and usage conditions for the EIA0 integrity protection algorithm in EPS NAS as specified in 3GPP documents.,"The EIA0 integrity protection algorithm is enumerated as one of the algorithms for data integrity protection in EPS NAS. EIA0 is identified with the 4-bit identifier '00002' and is known as the Null Integrity Protection algorithm. According to the specifications, EIA0 is only allowed for unauthenticated emergency calls. This condition is explicitly stated in multiple 3GPP documents, ensuring that EIA0 is not used for regular integrity protection purposes.

The mandatory and optional implementation requirements for EIA0 are as follows:
- UEs shall implement EIA0 for integrity protection of NAS and RRC signaling, but only for unauthenticated emergency calls.
- Implementation of EIA0 in MMEs, RNs, and eNBs is optional. If implemented, EIA0 must be disabled in deployments where support for unauthenticated emergency calling is not a regulatory requirement.

Synchronization of input parameters for integrity protection must be ensured for the protocols involved. Integrity protection and replay protection are required for NAS and RRC signaling, except in cases of unauthenticated emergency calls where EIA0 is selected.

Test cases to verify the correct usage of EIA0 include:
- Positive test: The eNB receives a UE security capability containing only EIA0 and sends the AS SMC to the UE, ensuring EIA0 is selected.
- Negative test: The eNB receives a UE security capability containing EIA0 and other integrity algorithms, and sends the AS SMC to the UE, ensuring EIA0 is not selected.

Describe the test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The test procedure for RSRP intra-frequency measurements under time-domain measurement resource restriction as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several steps and specific conditions. 

Initial conditions include setting up the test environment, which can be normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, or TH/VH, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 4.1. The frequencies to be tested are specified in Annex E table E-1 and 3GPP TS 36.508 clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1, with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz as defined in clause 4.3.1. The SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources are connected to the UE antenna connectors as shown in Annex A figure A.20 of 3GPP TS 36.508. General test parameter settings are established according to Table 9.1.8.2.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0. Message contents are defined in clause 9.1.8.2.4.3. Cell 1 serves as both the serving cell and aggressor cell to Cell 2, which is the neighboring cell. Cell 1 is used for connection setup with power levels set according to Annex C.0 and C.1.

The test procedure involves the following steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF according to 3GPP TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.3.
2. Set the parameters according to Tables 9.1.8.2.4.1-1 and Table 9.1.8.2.5-1. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.1.
3. SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. UE transmits an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. UE periodically transmits MeasurementReport messages.
6. After a 10-second wait from Step 3, SS checks the reported RSRP values in the periodic MeasurementReport messages. The reported RSRP value for Cell 2 is compared to the reported RSRP value for Cell 1 for each MeasurementReport message according to Table 9.1.8.2.5-2. If the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 2, the number of failed iterations is increased by one.
7. SS checks the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level according to Table G.2.3-1 in clause G.2 is achieved.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each sub-test in Table 9.1.8.2.5-1 as appropriate.

Describe the handling of Abstract Syntax Errors in RNA messages according to 3GPP TS 25.471.,"Abstract Syntax Errors in RNA messages occur when the receiving functional RNA entity encounters issues with the structure or content of the received message. These errors can be categorized into several cases: receiving IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE id), receiving IEs for which the logical range is violated, not receiving mandatory IEs or IE groups, receiving IEs or IE groups in the wrong order or with too many occurrences, and receiving conditional IEs or IE groups when the condition is not met.

The rules for constructing RNA messages specify that IEs must be ordered as they appear in object set definitions, and their presence must adhere to the specified conditions (mandatory, optional, or conditional). If a message is not constructed according to these rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error.

When a receiving node encounters an Abstract Syntax Error, it behaves according to the type of message received. If the error is in a message initiating a procedure, the node rejects the procedure and reports the cause value ","The answer should include the definition of Abstract Syntax Errors, the specific cases that constitute these errors, and the rules for constructing RNA messages.

Describe the Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) measurement process and requirements for both FR1 and FR2 as specified in 3GPP TS 38.106.,"The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and the measured waveform at the output of the repeater, known as the error vector. For both FR1 and FR2, the process of determining the repeater EVM involves several steps:

1. **Correction Steps**: Before calculating the repeater EVM, the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Additionally, the carrier leakage is removed from the measured waveform.

2. **Equalization Process**: The measured waveform is further equalized using channel estimates. For FR1, this is subjected to the repeater EVM equalizer spectrum flatness requirement specified in TS 38.101-1 clause 6.4.2.4. For FR2, it follows the requirements specified in TS 38.101-2 clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5.

3. **EVM Calculation**: 
   - For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage.
   - For CP-OFDM waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power, expressed as a percentage.

4. **Measurement Interval**: The basic repeater EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time domain. This interval is reduced by any symbols that contain an allowable power transient in the measurement interval, as defined in TS 38.101-1 clause 6.3.3 for FR1 and TS 38.101-2 clause 6.3.3 for FR2.

5. **Applicable Input Power Range**: 
   - For FR1, the repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum output power to the minimum power level specified in table 6.6.2.1-1.
   - For FR2, the repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is operating with an input power level within the range from what is required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (Prated,p,EIRP) to the minimum input power levels specified in table 7.6.2.1-1.

6. **OTA Modulation Quality Requirement for FR2**: The OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a directional requirement at the RIB and must be met within the OTA coverage range on the transmit side. The angle of arrival (AoA) of the incident wave of the received signal should be in the reference direction at the receive side.

In summary, the repeater EVM measurement process for both FR1 and FR2 involves correcting the measured waveform, equalizing it using channel estimates, calculating the EVM, and ensuring the measurement interval and input power range are within specified limits. Additionally, for FR2, the OTA modulation quality requirement must be met.","The answer must include the definition of Repeater EVM, the steps involved in correcting the measured waveform (sample timing offset, RF frequency offset, carrier leakage removal), the equalization process using channel estimates, the measurement interval for EVM, the applicable input power range for the repeater, and references to TS 38.101-1 for FR1 and TS 38.101-2 for FR2. Additionally, it should cover the OTA modulation quality requirement for FR2."
"Describe the operations and error handling mechanisms defined in the LMU LCS Protocol according to the 3GPP TS 44.071 document, including their ASN.1 specifications and local value allocations.","The LMU LCS Protocol as defined in the 3GPP TS 44.071 document includes a set of operations and error handling mechanisms that are crucial for the implementation of location services.

- StartRIT: Initiates Radio Interface Timing (RIT) measurements.
- ReportRIT: Reports the results of RIT measurements.
- StopRIT: Stops RIT measurements.
- IndicateRITError: Indicates errors related to RIT measurements.
- StatusQuery: Queries the status of the LMU.
- StatusUpdate: Updates the status of the LMU.
- ResetRequest: Requests a reset of the LMU.
- OMMngrRequest: Requests operations management.
- OMAgntRequest: Requests agent management.

These operations are categorized based on their relevance to RIT and general LMU procedures. The ASN.1 module definitions for these operations specify the arguments, results, and errors associated with each operation. For example, the StartRIT operation includes arguments (StartRITReq), results (StartRITRsp), and errors such as SystemFailure, DataMissing, UnexpectedDataValue, ResourcesNotAvailable, and UnDefinedError.

The ASN.1 specification of errors includes:
- SystemFailure
- DataMissing
- UnexpectedDataValue
- FacilityNotSupported
- UnknownSubscriber
- UnDefinedError

These errors are imported from the MAP-Errors module and are defined in the LLP-Errors module. The local value allocations for each operation and error are specified in the LLP-Protocol module. For instance, SystemFailure is allocated a local value of 10, DataMissing a local value of 11, and so on. Similarly, operations like StartRIT are allocated a local value of 10, ReportRIT a local value of 11, etc.

In summary, the LMU LCS Protocol operations and error handling mechanisms are well-defined with specific ASN.1 specifications and local value allocations, ensuring a structured approach to implementing location services.","The answer should include:
  - A summary of the operations defined in the LMU LCS Protocol, including StartRIT, ReportRIT, StopRIT, IndicateRITError, StatusQuery, ResetRequest, OMMngrRequest, OMAgntRequest, and StatusUpdate.

"What are the general blocking requirements for RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum according to TS 37.145, and what are the specific throughput and BER requirements for E-UTRA, UTRA FDD, and NR carriers?","According to TS 37.145, the general blocking requirements for RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum specify that the interfering signal shall be a UTRA FDD signal for a UTRA, E-UTRA, or NR wanted signal with a bandwidth of 20 MHz or less. For NR wanted signal channel bandwidths greater than 20 MHz, the interfering signal shall be a 20 MHz E-UTRA signal. For RIBs operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement also applies inside any sub-block gap if the gap size is at least 15 MHz, with the interfering signal offset defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the gap. For multi-band RIBs, the requirement applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap if the gap size is at least 15 MHz, with the interfering signal offset defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the gap.

The specific throughput and BER requirements are as follows:
- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.4.
- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.
- For any measured NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2 of TS 38.104.

Additionally, there is an intention to lower the maximum nominal output power and the lowest nominal output power for both CTS-MS and CTS-FP, with these values potentially being below the nominal output powers specified in GSM 05.05 subclause 4.1.1. A notable difference for CTS-FP is the use of reversed frequency bands compared to GSM-MS.","The answer should cover the intention to keep CTS-MS and CTS-FP characteristics in line with GSM-MS characteristics, the dependency on system scenario calculations for final decisions, the potential lowering of maximum and minimum nominal output power, and the reversed frequency bands for CTS-FP."
"Describe the performance measurements related to RRC connection establishment attempts and successes, as well as UE-associated logical NG-connection establishments from gNB to AMF, including the conditions under which these measurements are taken and their significance.","The performance measurements related to RRC connection establishment attempts and successes, as well as UE-associated logical NG-connection establishments from gNB to AMF, are crucial for assessing network performance and accessibility.

For RRC connection establishment attempts, the measurement counts the number of RRCSetupRequest messages received by the gNB from the UE for each establishment cause. This count excludes RRCSetupRequest messages received while a setup procedure is already ongoing for the same UE or during AMF overload actions. The possible establishment causes are detailed in TS 38.331 (clause 6.2.2). Each measurement is an integer value, and the sum of all per-cause measurements equals the total number of RRCSetupRequest messages. This measurement is identified as RRC.ConnEstabAtt.Cause and is valid for packet-switched traffic in 5GS networks. One of its uses is for performance assurance within the accessibility area.

For successful RRC establishments, the measurement counts the number of RRCSetupComplete messages received by the gNB following an RRC connection setup request. Similar to the attempts, the possible causes are listed in TS 38.331 (clause 6.2.2), and the sum of all per-cause measurements equals the total number of RRCSetupComplete messages. This measurement is identified as RRC.ConnEstabSucc.Cause and is also valid for packet-switched traffic in 5GS networks. It is used for performance assurance within the accessibility area.

Regarding UE-associated logical NG-connection establishments from gNB to AMF, the measurement for attempts counts the number of INITIAL UE MESSAGE transmissions by the gNB to the AMF for each RRCSetupRequest establishment cause. The possible causes are included in TS 38.331 (clause 6.2.2). Each subcounter is an integer value, and the measurement is identified as UECNTX.ConnEstabAtt.Cause. This measurement is valid for packet-switched traffic in 5GS networks and is used for performance assurance within the accessibility area.

For successful UE-associated logical NG-connection establishments, the measurement counts the number of first messages received by the gNB from the AMF that succeed the INITIAL UE MESSAGE on a UE-associated logical NG-connection. The possible causes are again listed in TS 38.331 (clause 6.2.2). Each subcounter is an integer value, and the measurement is identified as UECNTX.ConnEstabSucc.Cause. This measurement is also valid for packet-switched traffic in 5GS networks and is used for performance assurance within the accessibility area.

In AMF overload situations, certain signalling traffic may be subject to rejection by the NG-RAN node, as indicated in TS 38.413 (clause 9.3.1.105). This impacts the measurements by excluding certain RRCSetupRequest messages from being counted.

Overall, these performance measurements are essential for ensuring network reliability and accessibility, providing valuable data for performance assurance and optimization.","The answer should include the definitions and conditions for measuring RRC connection establishment attempts and successes, as well as UE-associated logical NG-connection establishments. It should cover the exclusion criteria for certain RRCSetupRequest messages, the significance of these measurements for performance assurance, and the specific establishment causes as defined in TS 38.331.

"Describe the implementation and structure of Credit Pooling in EPC as per 3GPP specifications, including the relevant Diameter messages and their formats.","Credit Pooling in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is a feature that allows multiple Usage Reporting Rules (URRs) to share a common pool of credits. When the Credit Pool feature is supported and the Control Plane (CP) function, such as the PGW-C, is instructed to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session, the CP function creates a URR for the Credit Pool. This URR includes one Aggregated URR ID Information Element (IE) per URR sharing the credit pool, which consists of the URR ID and the associated Multiplier to measure the abstract service units consumed from the credit pool.

The quota for the credit pool is calculated using the formula:
S = Q1*M1 + Q2*M2 + ... + Qn*Mn,
where S is the quota for the credit pool, Qn is the quota, and Mn is the multiplier for each Rating Group (RG) provided via the Multiple Services Credit Control from the Online Charging System (OCS). Each RG has a defined URRn.

The CP function may set the Reporting Trigger to report upon reaching a volume or time threshold or quota, and the Measurement Method to data volume, duration, or combined volume/duration according to the Measurement Method set in the URRs in the Credit Pool. Additionally, the CP function includes the Linked URR IE, set to the Credit Pool URR ID, in all URRs sharing the credit pool.

"Describe the UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure, including its purpose, conditions for performance, steps involved, and the process for counting and reporting UL packets.","The UE-initiated Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurement procedure is designed to enable the User Equipment (UE) to measure the PLR of uplink (UL) traffic to the User Plane Function (UPF) over an access of a Multi-Access (MA) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) session. This procedure can only be performed when the UE has user-plane resources on the access of the MA PDU session. It can be executed for the Quality of Service (QoS) flow of either the default QoS rule or a non-default QoS rule.

The UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of two main components:
a) The UE-initiated PLR count procedure.
b) One or more UE-initiated PLR report procedures.

The procedure begins with the UE sending a PMFP PLR count request message to the UPF. If the measurement is for the QoS flow of a non-default QoS rule, the message is transported over that specific QoS flow; otherwise, it is transported over the default QoS flow. Upon sending this message, the UE starts counting the transmitted UL packets over the QoS flow.

Upon receiving the PMFP PLR count request message, the UPF starts counting the received UL packets over the same QoS flow and sends a PMFP PLR count response message back to the UE. The UE then sends a PMFP PLR report request message to the UPF, requesting the number of counted UL packets and stops counting the transmitted UL packets. If the UE intends to restart the counting process, it includes an indication in the report request message and resumes counting the transmitted UL packets.

The UPF, upon receiving the report request message, stops counting the UL packets and sends a PMFP PLR report response message, which includes the number of UL packets counted since the last count request message. If the restart indication is accepted, the UPF restarts counting the received UL packets.

The UE calculates the UL packet loss rate based on its local count of transmitted UL packets and the reported count of received UL packets from the UPF. If the restart indication is not accepted, the UE aborts the restart of the measurement procedure.

An example of this procedure, which includes the steps and messages exchanged, is illustrated in figure 5.4.6.1-1. The procedure ensures that the UE does not initiate another PLR measurement over the same QoS flow on the same access until the current procedure is completed.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The purpose of the UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure.
  - The conditions under which the procedure can be performed.

Dual stack support for IPv4 and IPv6 is recommended due to potential transition scenarios. RNC/CN using IP transport must support Diffserv code point marking (IETF RFC 2474), with the code point determined from application parameters.

These protocol layers and their functionalities ensure robust and reliable signalling and communication within the network as specified in TS 25.412.","The answer must include a detailed description of each protocol layer mentioned in the documents, their specific functionalities, and any relevant standards or references. It should cover SCCP, MTP3-B, SAAL-NNI, ATM, M3UA, SCTP, IP over ATM, AAL5, and IP functionalities including IPv6 and IPv4 support, as well as Diffserv code point marking."
Describe the transport protocols and identifiers used in different interfaces within the UTRAN network as specified in the 3GPP documents.,"The UTRAN network supports various transport protocols and identifiers across different interfaces to ensure efficient data transmission and network management. 

1. **Transport Protocols**:
   - **Iu-CS Interface**: RTP over UDP over IP is supported for data streams. The transport bearer is identified by the UDP port number and IP address (source and destination).
   - **Iu-PS Interface**: GTP-U over UDP over IP is used for data streams. The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID and IP address (source and destination).
   - **Iu-BC Interface**: TCP over IP is supported for data streams. The transport bearer is identified by the TCP port number and IP address (source and destination).
   - **Iub and Iur Interfaces**: UDP over IP is supported for DCH and E-DCH data streams. The transport bearer is identified by the UDP port number and IP address (source and destination).
   - **Iub Interface**: UDP over IP is also supported for RACH, FACH, PCH, DSCH [TDD], USCH [TDD], and HS-DSCH data streams.

2. **Identification of Transport Bearers**:
   - **UDP and TCP**: The transport bearers are identified using the port numbers and IP addresses (source and destination).
   - **GTP-U**: The transport bearer is identified using the GTP-U TEID and IP addresses.

3. **NSAP Structure**:
   - The NSAP structure is used to encapsulate IP addresses on several interfaces, including Iu-CS, Iur, and Iub. This structure helps in explicitly identifying the type of the TNL address being conveyed by the given RNL protocol. On the Iu-PS interface, straight IP addressing is used instead of the NSAP structure.

4. **IP Dual Stack Support**:
   - IP dual stack support is recommended for the transition period from IPv4 to IPv6 in the transport network. While IPv6 support is mandatory, IPv4 support is optional but not precluded.

5. **IP Differentiated Services Code Point Marking**:
   - IP Differentiated Services code point marking is supported to manage traffic categories. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv code points is configurable by O&M.

6. **Optional Protocols and Features**:
   - IP multicast may be supported for FACH data streams on the Iub interface, provided the security of the RAN is not compromised. This is feasible in a closed IP-based RAN.

These protocols and identifiers ensure robust and flexible communication within the UTRAN network, accommodating various data transmission needs and network configurations.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The types of transport protocols supported on different interfaces (e.g., RTP over UDP over IP, GTP-U over UDP over IP, TCP over IP, UDP over IP).
- The methods of identifying transport bearers (e.g., using UDP port number and IP address, GTP-U TEID, TCP port number).
- The use of NSAP structure for encapsulating IP addresses and the specific interfaces where this is applicable.
- The support for IP dual stack and IP Differentiated Services code point marking.
- Any optional protocols or features (e.g., IP multicast for FACH data streams) and their conditions for use."
"Explain the impact of Dynamic Spatial Reuse (DSR) on voice call quality and system performance in a GSM network, considering the requirements and findings from 3GPP TS 45.912.","Dynamic Spatial Reuse (DSR) can significantly impact voice call quality and system performance in a GSM network. According to the findings from 3GPP TS 45.912, several key points need to be considered:

1. **MIMO Receiver Requirements**: A MIMO receiver must have at least as many Rx antennas as there are data streams occupying the same timeslot and channel. However, DSR proposes spatial multiplexing without ensuring this requirement is met. Typically, a BTS has 2 Rx antennas, but there may be more than two data streams in a given timeslot and channel. This can lead to limitations in the receiver's ability to handle multiple data streams effectively.

2. **Spatial Filtering vs. Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC)**: The weighting coefficients of the two Rx antennas can only be set for either spatial filtering or MRC, but not both simultaneously. If the antennas are used for spatial filtering to separate a conventional GSM signal and a DSR signal occupying the same channel, they cannot be used to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by MRC. This trade-off can affect the overall signal quality.

3. **Interference with Voice Calls**: Since the TX antennas in MIMO are located on the same terminal, only the throughput of that single terminal suffers if spatial multiplexing fails. However, with DSR, the two transmit antennas are on different terminals, which means a DSR user can potentially jam the uplink of another mobile station's voice call.

4. **Dynamic System Simulations**: Simulations were run to evaluate the impact of DSR on voice call quality. The reference EGPRS simulation showed that without DSR power reduction, the number of bad quality speech connections slightly increased compared to the reference EGPRS simulation. However, a 2 dB power reduction was sufficient to maintain speech performance at the reference level across various quality criteria.

5. **Impact on Uplink Carrier-to-Interference Ratio (C/I)**: System simulations revealed that the C/I for speech users is 1 dB to 2 dB lower in the DSR case compared to the EGPRS case, with 1.7x higher throughput. This difference is due to blurred reuse in the DSR scenario, where adjacent channel interferers have a large part of their energy in the desired band, and the receiver filter in the BTS cannot suppress it effectively.

In summary, while DSR can enhance data throughput, it poses challenges for voice call quality and system performance due to limitations in antenna requirements, trade-offs in signal processing techniques, and potential interference issues. Proper power control and careful planning are essential to mitigate these impacts.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The necessity of having at least as many Rx antennas as data streams in MIMO receivers and the limitations posed by DSR.
  - The trade-off between spatial filtering and MRC in improving signal quality.
  - The potential for DSR users to interfere with other users' voice calls.
  - Results from dynamic system simulations showing the impact of DSR on voice call quality and the required power reduction to maintain quality.
  - The effect of DSR on uplink carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) and the implications of blurred reuse in DSR scenarios."
Describe the procedure and requirements for handling synchronization failures during EPS authentication in 3GPP networks.,"During EPS authentication in 3GPP networks, the Mobility Management Entity (MME) plays a crucial role in handling synchronization failures. When the MME receives an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with the EMM cause #21 'synch failure' and a re-synchronization token AUTS, it must include the stored RAND and the received AUTS in the authentication data request to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS). This requirement ensures that the HSS can check the AUTS parameter before sending new authentication vectors to the MME.

The purpose of this procedure is to provide the MME with one or more EPS authentication vectors (RAND, AUTN, XRES, KASME) from the user's Home Environment (HE) to perform user authentication. Each EPS authentication vector can be used to authenticate the User Equipment (UE). It is recommended that the MME fetch only one EPS authentication vector at a time due to the reduced need to perform Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) runs in EPS through the use of a more elaborate key hierarchy.

If the MME does not include RAND and AUTS in the authentication data request to the HSS, the HSS will return a new authentication vector based on its current value of the sequence number SQNHE. While a new authentication procedure between MME and UE using this new authentication vector may be successful if the cause of the synchronization failure was a 'stale' challenge, it will fail again if the cause was a problem with the sequence number SQNHE in the HSS. This failure can be considered security-relevant as it may lead to a subscriber being shut out from the system permanently.

Upon receiving the authentication data request, the HE may have pre-computed the required number of EPS authentication vectors and retrieve them from the HSS database or compute them on demand. The HE sends an authentication response back to the MME containing the requested information. If multiple EPS authentication vectors are requested, they are ordered based on their sequence numbers, and the MME must use them in order.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of MME in handling synchronization failures.
  - The necessity of including RAND and AUTS in the authentication data request to HSS.
  - The process of fetching EPS authentication vectors from HSS.
  - The implications of not including RAND and AUTS in the request, including potential security-relevant failure cases.
  - The sequence and order of EPS authentication vectors and their usage."

Explain the process and implications of NAT remapping in the context of H(e)NB and SeGW as specified in 3GPP TS 29.139.,"The process of NAT remapping in the context of H(e)NB (Home eNodeB) and SeGW (Security Gateway) involves several key steps and has specific implications as outlined in 3GPP TS 29.139.

Initially, the tunnel establishment procedure between H(e)NB and SeGW is defined in TS 29.139 6.2.1. This procedure sets up the secure communication channel necessary for the H(e)NB to connect to the core network through the SeGW.

NAT remapping can occur when the UDP port number is reassigned by the NAT, or the H(e)NB local IP address is reallocated due to a NAT restart, as specified in TS 29.139 6.2.2. When NAT remapping is detected, the SeGW initiates the tunnel disconnection procedure as specified in TS 29.139 6.3.3. This procedure uses the methods defined in IETF RFC 5996 to disconnect the IPsec tunnel to the H(e)NB. Following the disconnection, the H(e)NB must re-initiate the tunnel establishment procedure as per TS 29.139 6.2.1.

Furthermore, TS 29.139 6.3.2 highlights that if NAT remapping is detected by the SeGW, it will initiate the tunnel disconnection procedure. However, it is noted that there are no procedures defined in the current release of the specification to enable the SeGW to send the modified H(e)NB local IP address information to the H(e)NB during the lifetime of the IKEv2 security association. This limitation implies that the H(e)NB must rely on re-establishing the tunnel to update its IP address information, potentially causing temporary communication disruptions.

In summary, NAT remapping triggers a sequence of actions involving tunnel disconnection and re-establishment, with specific procedures defined for these steps. However, the current specification does not provide a method for updating the H(e)NB local IP address during the active security association, which can lead to temporary connectivity issues.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The initial tunnel establishment procedure between H(e)NB and SeGW as per TS 29.139 6.2.1.
  - The conditions under which NAT remapping occurs and the actions taken by SeGW and H(e)NB as per TS 29.139 6.2.2.
  - The specific procedure used by SeGW to disconnect an IPsec tunnel as defined in IETF RFC 5996, referenced in TS 29.139 6.3.3.
  - The detection of NAT remapping by SeGW and the current limitations in the specification regarding updating H(e)NB local IP address during the lifetime of IKEv2 security association as noted in TS 29.139 6.3.2."
"Describe the spreading operation for downlink physical channels, including the modulation mapper stage, channelisation stage, IQ combining stage, and scrambling stage.","The spreading operation for downlink physical channels involves several stages: modulation mapper, channelisation, IQ combining, and scrambling. Initially, modulation mapping is performed as described in subclause 5.2.3. Following this, the channelisation stage spreads the I and Q branches to the chip rate using the same real-valued channelisation code Cch,SF,m. Each input symbol on the I and Q branches is converted into a sequence of SF chips, which corresponds to the channelisation code chip sequence multiplied by the real-valued symbol. The channelisation code sequence is aligned with the symbol boundary. In the IQ combining stage, the real-valued chip sequence on the Q-branch is complex multiplied with j and summed with the corresponding real-valued chip sequence on the I-branch, resulting in a single complex-valued chip sequence I+jQ. This complex-valued chip sequence is then scrambled in the scrambling stage by a complex-valued scrambling code Sdl,n. Finally, all complex-valued spread channels are separately weighted and combined, along with separately weighted Primary SCH and Secondary SCH, into one complex-valued chip sequence using complex addition. The resulting signal is modulated prior to transmission.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The stages involved in the spreading operation: modulation mapper, channelisation, IQ combining, and scrambling.
  - The process of spreading the I and Q branches to the chip rate using the same real-valued channelisation code.

1. **Colorimetry Requirements**:
   - The Bitstream must use Recommendation ITU-R BT.709 colorimetry.
   - In the Video Usability Information (VUI), the `video_signal_type_present_flag` and `colour_description_present_flag` values must be set to 1.
   - The `colour_primaries`, `transfer_characteristics`, and `matrix_coefficients` values in the VUI must all be set to 1.
   - The Receiver must be capable of decoding and rendering Bitstreams that use Recommendation ITU-R BT.709 colorimetry according to these requirements.

2. **Frame Rate Requirements**:
   - The Bitstream must have one of the following frame rates: 24; 25; 30; 24/1001; 30/1001; 50; 60; 60/1001 Hz.
   - If timing information is present in the VUI (`timing_info_present_flag` set to 1), the values of `num_units_in_tick` and `time_scale` must be set according to the allowed frame rates.
   - The timing information in the video Bitstream should be consistent with the timing information signaled at the system level.
   - The frame rate must not change between two Random Access Points (RAPs), and the `fixed_frame_rate_flag` value must be set to 1.
   - The Receiver must be capable of decoding and rendering Bitstreams that use these frame rates according to the documented requirements.

3. **Aspect Ratio Requirements**:
   - The aspect ratio information must be present in the VUI (`aspect_ratio_present_flag` set to 1).
   - The `aspect_ratio_idc` value must be set to 1, indicating a square pixel format.
   - There are no requirements on output timing conformance for H.264/AVC decoding, and any Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD) parameters present should be ignored by the Receiver.

"Describe the procedures and conditions for handling Call Completion (CC) requests in a 3GPP network, particularly focusing on the roles and actions of the terminating Application Server (AS) when the callee is busy or becomes available.","In a 3GPP network, the handling of Call Completion (CC) requests involves several procedures and conditions, particularly focusing on the roles and actions of the terminating Application Server (AS) when the callee is busy or becomes available.

1. **General Process for Handling CC Requests**:
   The terminating AS is responsible for managing CC requests. When a CC request is received, the AS places it in a queue and monitors the status of the callee (destination B).

2. **Actions When the Callee Becomes Available**:
   When the callee becomes registered or not busy, the terminating AS checks the queue for any pending CC requests. If there is an entry currently being processed, no further action is taken. Otherwise, the AS examines the entries in the queue. If an entry is suspended, another entry is selected; if not suspended, the AS selects it for CC recall. The AS then starts the destination B idle guard timer (CC-T8). Upon expiry of CC-T8, the AS processes the selected CC request.

3. **Handling Scenarios When the Callee is Busy**:
   - **Busy Upon Expiry of CC-T8**: If the callee is busy when CC-T8 expires, the AS defers servicing the CC queue until the callee becomes not busy again.
   - **Busy Upon Arrival of CC Call**: If the callee is busy when a CC call arrives, the procedures depend on whether the retain option is supported:
     - **Retain Option Not Supported**: The AS cancels the CC request and sends a 486 (Busy Here) response with a Call-Info header field to the originating AS. Normal procedures apply if a new CCBS invocation request is received.
     - **Retain Option Supported**: The AS retains the original CC request in the queue, continues to monitor destination B, stops timer CC-T9, and sends a 486 (Busy Here) response with a Call-Info header field to the originating AS.
   - **No CC Call Result**: If no CC call results from the CC recall mechanism and the recall timer CC-T9 expires, the AS sends a NOTIFY request to the originating AS, indicating the termination of the subscription.

4. **Priority Handling of CC Requests**:
   When a user is both a caller (user A) and a callee (user B) simultaneously, the CC AS prioritizes handling CC requests activated by this user over CC requests from other users.

5. **Interaction Between CW Service and CC Recall**:
   The CW AS does not invoke the CW service on a CC recall. For a waiting communication, destination B is not considered busy. If the communication waiting indication cannot be given at destination B, user A receives a busy indication and can invoke the CCBS service to destination B. Procedures for encountering busy again during a CC call are described in the relevant subclauses.

These procedures ensure efficient handling of CC requests, maintaining communication continuity and user satisfaction in a 3GPP network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The general process for handling CC requests by the terminating AS.
  - Actions taken by the terminating AS when the callee becomes available, including queue processing and timer CC-T8.

What are the requirements and conditions for UE to perform and report SRS-RSRP measurements according to TS 38.533?,"According to TS 38.533, the UE must be capable of performing SRS-RSRP measurements based on the configured SRS resource. The measurement period for these measurements is defined as TSRS_RSRP_measurement_period for both FR1 and FR2. If the SRS resources configured for measurement overlap partially or fully with the SMTC window, SSB, CSI-RS configured for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP measurement, or measurement gaps, the requirements for TSRS_RSRP_measurement_period are not specified.

When configured by the network, the UE must be able to perform SRS-RSRP measurements of the configured srs-ResourceConfigCLI. These requirements apply when the subcarrier spacing for the SRS-RSRP measurement resource configuration matches the subcarrier spacing of the active DL BWP of the serving cell. The UE is not required to measure SRS using different subcarrier spacing compared to the downlink active BWP subcarrier spacing of the same carrier.

For SRS resources to be considered measurable, the following conditions must be met for each relevant SRS:
- SRS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.22.1 for FR1 and FR2 for the corresponding band.
- SRS_RP and SRS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.7 for the corresponding band.

The UE must send SRS-RSRP reports only for report configurations according to reportType, which can be either cliPeriodical or cliEventTriggered when SRS-RSRP reporting is configured. The SRS-RSRP value must be reported as a 7-bit value in the range [-140, -44] dBm with a 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.22.1 for FR1 and FR2.

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports must meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.1. The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting must meet the requirements specified in clause 9.7.2.3.3. The UE must not send any event-triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that triggers a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signaling on the DCCH. The delay uncertainty, resulting from inserting the measurement report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH, is 2 x TTIDCCH. The measurement reporting delay excludes any delay caused by the lack of UL resources for the UE to send the measurement report.

"Describe the procedures and coding for operating bands in 3GPP TS 37.466, referencing the relevant sections and tables from TS 37.461 and TS 37.466.","The procedures and coding for operating bands in 3GPP TS 37.466 involve several steps and specific data handling methods. Firstly, the operating bands for a UTRA/FDD BS, UTRA/TDD BS, E-UTRA BS, NR BS, or antenna modem are defined in 3GPP TS 25.101, TS 36.101, and TS 38.101, as stated in TS 37.461 subclause 4.3.7. The manufacturer must declare the operating bands of the BS modem or antenna modem.

In TS 37.466 Annex B, the standard fields for additional data are used by procedures such as SetDeviceData, GetDeviceData, AntennaSetDeviceData, and AntennaGetDeviceData. These fields have no operational impact and are stored in little endian order for multiple-octet numbers. ASCII variables shorter than the assigned field lengths are right-aligned, with leading blanks filled with null characters (0x00). Unused or uninitialized parameters return the value 0x00 for the GetDeviceData, AntennaGetDeviceData, and TMAGetDeviceData procedures.

Annex F of TS 37.466 provides coding for operating bands, although it is not updated in Rel-16 and onwards.

Finally, the interpretation of specific fields (0x13, 0x14, and 0x15) should be included, explaining the bit values and frequency steps."
"Describe the procedures for RACS parameter provisioning in 3GPP networks, including the differences between 4G and 5G implementations.","The procedures for RACS (Radio Access Capability Set) parameter provisioning in 3GPP networks involve several steps and types of HTTP messages for creating, updating, replacing, and deleting provisioning information. 

In 4G networks, the SCS/AS (Service Capability Server/Application Server) initiates these procedures by sending HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE messages to the SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function). 

1. **Creating a new RACS Parameter Provisioning**: The SCS/AS sends an HTTP POST request to the SCEF with a list of RACS IDs, their radio capability parameters, and the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s). If authorized, the SCEF interacts with the UCMF (UE Capability Management Function) and responds with a 201 Created or 200 OK status, including the successfully provisioned RACS information. If provisioning fails for some RACS IDs, the SCEF includes failure reports in the response.

2. **Replacing an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning**: The SCS/AS sends an HTTP PUT request to the SCEF to change all properties of an existing resource. The message body includes the same type of information as the POST request. The SCEF processes the request similarly, responding with 200 OK or 204 No Content if successful, or with failure reports if some RACS IDs fail.

3. **Partially updating an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning**: The SCS/AS sends an HTTP PATCH request to the SCEF to change some properties of an existing resource. The SCEF handles the request and responds similarly to the PUT request.

4. **Deleting an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning**: The SCS/AS sends an HTTP DELETE request to the SCEF. Upon successful interaction with the UCMF, the SCEF removes the resource and responds with 204 No Content.

Failure handling is detailed in TS 29.122 clauses 5.16.3 and 5.16.5, which specify the failure codes and response procedures for unsuccessful provisioning requests. If all RACS IDs fail, the SCEF may send a 500 Internal Server Error response with failure reports.

In 5G networks, the procedures are similar but with changes in terminology:
- The SCS/AS is referred to as the AF (Application Function).
- The SCEF is referred to as the NEF (Network Exposure Function).

These changes reflect the updated architecture in 5G networks, but the fundamental procedures for RACS parameter provisioning remain consistent with those in 4G networks.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the offline charging functionality in IMS networks, including the types of Charging Data Requests and their usage in different scenarios.","The offline charging functionality in IMS networks is based on the IMS network nodes reporting accounting information upon reception of various SIP methods or ISUP messages, as most of the accounting relevant information is contained in these messages. This reporting is achieved by sending Charging Data Requests from the IMS Network Elements to the Charging Data Function (CDF) or Charging Function (CHF). The types of Charging Data Requests include start, interim, stop, and event for the CDF, and Initial, Update, Termination, and Event for the CHF.

For successful SIP sessions, the charging client uses Charging Data Requests (start/Initial, interim/Update, and stop/Termination). For unsuccessful SIP sessions and session unrelated procedures, it uses Charging Data Requests (event). The specific SIP methods or ISUP messages that trigger a Charging Data Request are operator configurable in the nodes. Tables 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 describe all possible Charging Data Requests that might be sent from various IMS nodes such as P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, IBCF, MGCF, BGCF, and MRFC.

Session CDRs are generated by the CDF on a per session level, reflecting the usage of multimedia sessions. A session CDR is opened upon reception of a Charging Data Request (start) message, and partial CDRs may be generated upon reception of a Charging Data Request (interim) message due to session modification procedures or expiration of the Charging Data Interim Interval. The final session CDR is closed upon reception of a Charging Data Request (stop) message, indicating the termination of the SIP session.

For unsuccessful session set-up attempts, accounting information may be sent using Charging Data Request (event) messages. Session unrelated CDRs are created in a ","The answer should cover the offline charging functionality in IMS networks, detailing the types of Charging Data Requests (start, interim, stop, event) and their specific usage in successful SIP sessions, unsuccessful SIP sessions, and session unrelated procedures.

"What are the requirements for UE maximum output power reduction in E-UTRA and NR single carrier and CA operations, and how are these requirements specified for different UE power classes and modulation schemes?","The requirements for UE maximum output power reduction in E-UTRA and NR single carrier and CA operations are specified in various clauses of TS 36.101 and TS 38.101-2. For E-UTRA single carrier and CA operations, the requirements are detailed in clauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.3A of TS 36.101. For NR single carrier and CA operations, the requirements are specified in clauses 6.2.2, 6.2A.2, and 6.2D.2 of TS 38.101-2.

The general requirements for UE maximum output power reduction include considerations for higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks). Specifically, for UE Power Class 1, 2, and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) is detailed in Table 6.2.3-1 of TS 36.101. This table specifies the MPR values for different modulation schemes such as QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM, and the evaluation periods for MPR are provided in Table 6.2.3-2.

For non-contiguous resource allocation in single component carriers, the MPR is calculated using specific formulas based on the modulation scheme. For example, for QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM, the MPR is given by CEIL{MA, 0.5}, where MA is defined by different equations depending on the value of A (NRB_alloc / NRB). For 256QAM, different equations are used to define MA.

Additional requirements and conditions for UE maximum output power reduction include specific conditions for different frequency bands and power classes. For instance, for transmissions on an Scell in Band 46 or Band 49 within a component carrier of a nominal channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or 20 MHz, the allowed MPR is specified according to Table 6.2.3-1 for certain RIV values. For other RIV values, the allowed MPR is 2.5 dB for QPSK modulation, 3 dB for 16QAM modulation, and 4 dB for 64QAM modulation.

Furthermore, for a power class 2 capable UE operating on Band 41, if certain conditions are met (such as an IE P-max of 23 dBm or lower or specific uplink/downlink configurations), the requirements for power class 2 are not applicable, and the requirements for power class 3 UE shall apply. The impact of IE P-Max settings is also considered, where the UE must meet the requirements for the default power class or the supported power class based on the provided IE P-Max value.

Overall, the requirements for UE maximum output power reduction are comprehensive and take into account various factors such as modulation schemes, resource block allocations, frequency bands, power classes, and specific IE P-Max settings.","The answer should include:

  - The applicability to packet switched traffic.
  - The relevance to 5GS."
"Describe the application layer redundancy scheme and bandwidth properties as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114, including the negotiation process for bandwidth properties.","The application layer redundancy scheme in 3GPP TS 26.114 is designed to handle severe packet loss rates by encapsulating one or more previously transmitted speech frames into the same RTP packet as the current frame. This means an RTP packet can contain zero, one, or several redundant speech frames along with zero, one, or several non-redundant speech frames. When transmitting redundancy, the MTSI client should switch to a lower codec mode if possible, utilizing the codec mode rates within the negotiated codec mode set. Redundant speech frames should not be sent before reaching the targeted codec mode. The scheme allows up to 300% redundancy, meaning a speech frame can be repeated in three other RTP packets.

Bandwidth properties are defined to describe different transport bandwidths, including Maximum Supported Bandwidth, Maximum Desired Bandwidth, Minimum Desired Bandwidth, and Minimum Supported Bandwidth. These properties include IP, UDP, and RTP overhead. Additional properties like IP version, Maximum packet rate, and Minimum packet rate assist in recalculating bandwidth values when converting between different IP versions. The best compromise between quality and network utilization is achieved using bandwidths from Minimum Desired Bandwidth to Maximum Desired Bandwidth. Bandwidths below Minimum Desired Bandwidth may be used during poor conditions, while bandwidths above Maximum Desired Bandwidth can provide room for redundancy during very bad conditions.

The offer/answer negotiation process for 'a=bw-info' attribute lines involves handling each attribute line, payload type, direction, and bandwidth property individually. An offerer can use 'a=bw-info' for some or all offered payload types and may use wild cards to apply bandwidth properties to all payload types. The offerer must ensure no contradicting information and avoid multiple occurrences of the same bandwidth property for the same payload type, direction, and IP version. An answerer can remove or add 'a=bw-info' lines and individual bandwidth properties. The SDP offer may include any defined directionality, and the answerer should include 'a=bw-info' in the answer for all offered payload types. The answerer can modify bandwidth properties by reducing Maximum Supported Bandwidth, Maximum Desired Bandwidth, Minimum Desired Bandwidth, and Maximum Packet Rate, or increasing Minimum Supported Bandwidth and Minimum Packet Rate.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Explanation of the application layer redundancy scheme, including how speech frames are encapsulated in RTP packets and the codec mode adjustments required.
- Description of the bandwidth properties, including their definitions and relationships, and how they include IP, UDP, and RTP overhead.

"Describe the procedure for testing the SAN (System Antenna Node) as outlined in TS 38.181, including the key steps and requirements for measuring throughput.","The procedure for testing the System Antenna Node (SAN) as outlined in TS 38.181 involves several key steps and requirements to ensure accurate measurement of throughput. 

1. **Placement and Alignment**: 
   - Place the SAN with its manufacturer-declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the calibrated point in the test system.
   - Align the manufacturer-declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN with the test system.
   - Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be tested.
   - Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power from the test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.
   - For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same operational band as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test configuration.

"What are the requirements and test cases for GTP-C filtering as specified in TS 33.117, and how do they apply to different network products according to TS 33.216, TS 33.326, and TS 33.511?","The requirements for GTP-C filtering as specified in TS 33.117 include the capability to check whether the sender of a GTP-C message is authorized to send messages pertaining to the protocol. This check can be performed against a whitelist or blacklist of permitted message type/sender identity combinations. The actions that should be supported when the check is satisfied include discarding, accepting, and accounting for the matching messages. The accounting action is useful for monitoring traffic before blocking it.

The requirement is conditional, meaning that either the network product must support the capability and state this in the product documentation, or the product documentation must state that the capability is not supported and that the network product needs to be deployed with a separate entity providing the capability, such as a GTP firewall.

The test case for GTP-C filtering, named TC_GTP-C_FILTERING, aims to verify that the network product provides filtering functionalities for incoming GTP-C messages. The test involves configuring the network product with specific rules, using a network traffic generator or pcap file to send GTP-C messages, and verifying the actions taken by the network product using a network traffic analyzer. The expected results include receiving GTP-C EchoResponse messages only for authorized source IP addresses and correctly accounting for messages matching the rules.

The identification of a cell includes detection and performing a single measurement with a measurement period defined for UE category M1. In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurement period for intra frequency measurements is specified in Table 8.1.23.3-1, and the UE must be capable of performing measurements for at least 6 cells when measurement gaps are activated. If more than 6 cells are identified, the reporting rate of RSRP measurements may be decreased. The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering, must be less than the defined period in Clause 8.1.23.3.

"What are the performance criteria for base stations and ancillary equipment as defined in TS 37.113, and how do these criteria ensure the proper functioning of the equipment during and after testing?","The performance criteria for base stations and ancillary equipment as defined in TS 37.113 are designed to ensure that the equipment operates correctly during and after testing, maintaining communication links and user control functions. 

For base stations, the performance criteria are outlined in subclause 6.2. At the conclusion of each exposure, the equipment under test (EUT) must operate with no user noticeable loss of the communication link. After the total test, which includes a series of individual exposures, the EUT must function as intended without any loss of user control functions or stored data, as declared by the manufacturer. The communication link must also be maintained throughout the test. Specific criteria for different technologies, such as E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE, NB-IoT, and NR, are defined based on manufacturer declarations and detailed in various tables and subclauses within the document.

For ancillary equipment, the performance criteria are specified in subclause 6.4. The apparatus must continue to operate as intended after the test, with no degradation of performance or loss of function below the performance level specified by the manufacturer. During the test, some degradation of performance is allowed, but the minimum performance level or permissible performance loss must be maintained. If these levels are not specified by the manufacturer, they can be derived from the product description and documentation, as well as reasonable user expectations.

"What are the performance criteria for base stations, ancillary equipment, and repeaters as defined in TS 25.113?","The performance criteria for base stations, ancillary equipment, and repeaters as defined in TS 25.113 are as follows:

1. **Base Stations (Subclause 6.2)**:
   - The test should be performed using a bearer with the characteristics of data rate and BLER defined in Table 2. If none of these bearers are supported by the base station (BS), the characteristics of the bearer used shall be recorded.
   - The BS Uplink and Downlink paths must each meet the performance criteria defined in Table 2 during the test. If evaluated as a one loop, the criteria is two times the value shown in Table 2.
   - After each test case, the BS must operate as intended with no loss of user control function, stored data, and the communication link must be maintained.
   - The performance criteria include a temporary BLER > 10^-2, but the communication link must be maintained even if a bearer with different characteristics is used.

2. **Ancillary Equipment (Subclause 6.5)**:
   - The apparatus must continue to operate as intended after the test, with no degradation of performance or loss of function below the performance level specified by the manufacturer.

"Describe the provision of capabilities of the NGN to support end users attached to an NGCN, highlighting the differences between scenarios where each site has a service subscription to the IMS and where the NGCN operator has a service level agreement with the IMS operator.","The provision of capabilities of the NGN to support end users attached to an NGCN can be described through two different scenarios. 

In the first scenario, each site of the NGCN has a service subscription to the IMS. This means that the private extensions behind the NGCN do not need their own service subscription, as they are owned and managed by the NGCN. The NGCN site interfaces to the NGN using SIP as the control protocol. Business trunking applications, such as those defined in subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 22.519, can be provided by an Application Server (AS) if required. If such capabilities are not needed, the AS is not included in any request processing.

In the second scenario, the NGCN operator has a service level agreement with the IMS operator. Services are provided to the private extensions behind the NGCN using the NGCN. Similar to the first scenario, the NGCN sites interface to the NGN using SIP as the control protocol. However, in this scenario, intelligent routeing tables at the routeing function are used to provide business trunking applications. One mechanism to support such functionality is to use an AS attached to a transit function via the ISC interface, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218. If such capabilities are not required, the AS is not included in any request processing.

The key differences between these scenarios are the service subscription models and the mechanisms used to provide business trunking applications. In the first scenario, each site has an individual service subscription to the IMS, while in the second scenario, the NGCN operator has a service level agreement with the IMS operator. Additionally, the second scenario utilizes intelligent routeing tables and the ISC interface for business trunking applications, whereas the first scenario does not.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The difference in service subscription models (individual site subscription vs. operator service level agreement).
  - The role of private extensions behind the NGCN in both scenarios.
  - The use of SIP as the control protocol in both scenarios.
  - The provision of business trunking applications and the role of the AS in both scenarios.
  - The use of intelligent routeing tables and the ISC interface in the second scenario."
Explain the process and conditions for establishing an uplink packet resource in dedicated mode according to 3GPP TS 44.018.,"The establishment of an uplink packet resource in dedicated mode is initiated by the RR (Radio Resource) entity of the mobile station using the packet request procedure. This procedure is triggered by a request from the upper layers to transfer an LLC (Logical Link Control) PDU. The request from the upper layers specifies several details including TLLI (Temporary Logical Link Identity), radio priority, requested RLC (Radio Link Control) mode associated with the packet transfer, LLC frame type, establishment cause, QoS (Quality of Service) information for the requested packet session, and optionally, the PFI (Packet Flow Identifier).

Upon receiving such a request, the RR entity of the mobile station will initiate the packet request procedure if access to the network is allowed, which is determined by the support of dual transfer mode in the cell. If access is not allowed, the RR entity will reject the request. Additionally, if the request from the upper layers indicates any signaling procedure, the acknowledged RLC mode shall be requested.

The mobile station initiates the establishment of the packet resource by sending a DTM (Dual Transfer Mode) REQUEST message on the main DCCH (Dedicated Control Channel). This message contains several key elements: TLLI, Channel Request Description, Packet establishment cause (indicating a request to send user data, cell update, page response, or a mobility management message), PFI (if PFC procedures are supported by the mobile station), Multiple TBF (Temporary Block Flow) Capability, RLC Non-persistent Mode Capability, and MS (Mobile Station) capabilities related to support of Reduced Latency or FANR (Flexible Asymmetric Network Resource), Uplink EGPRS2 (Enhanced General Packet Radio Service) and Downlink EGPRS2. After sending the DTM REQUEST message, the mobile station starts timer T3148.

It is important to note that the network has the ability to order its preferred RLC mode when establishing uplink packet resources, independently of the RLC mode requested by the mobile station. This means that if the mobile station supports RLC non-persistent mode, the network may allocate an EGPRS TBF that uses this RLC mode.","The answer must include:
  - The role of the RR entity in initiating the uplink packet resource establishment.
  - The triggering mechanism by upper layers and the specific details they provide.
  - The RR entity's actions based on network access conditions.
  - The contents and significance of the DTM REQUEST message.
  - The condition for network access (dual transfer mode support).
  - The implications of the network's ability to order preferred RLC mode independently."
"Describe the process and requirements for the DCCF to notify the NF Service Consumer about a subscribed data event, including the handling of successful and erroneous HTTP POST requests.","The DCCF (Data Collection and Control Function) notifies the NF (Network Function) Service Consumer about a subscribed data event by invoking the Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify service operation. This involves sending an HTTP POST request with the notification URI as the Resource URI. The notification URI is obtained from the NdccfDataSubscription data structure during the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation.

The request body of the HTTP POST must include the NdccfDataSubscriptionNotification data structure, which contains:
- The data notification correlation identifier within the 'dataNotifCorrId' attribute.
- The timestamp representing when the DCCF completes the preparation of the requested data within the 'timeStamp' attribute.
- One of the following:
  - The data notification within the 'dataNotif' attribute.
  - Summarized data derived from events based on processing and formatting instructions within the 'dataReports' attribute.
  - Information for fetching the contents of the notification within the 'fetchInstruct' attribute.

Optionally, the request body may include a termination request within the 'terminationReq' attribute.

Upon successful processing and acceptance of the HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer must store the notification and respond with an HTTP '204 No Content' status code. If errors occur during the processing of the HTTP POST request, the NF Service Consumer must send an HTTP error response as specified in the relevant documentation. If the NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function) determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, it must send an HTTP redirect response as specified in the appropriate guidelines.","The answer should include:

How should the User-Agent request header field be formatted for different MBS User Services functions according to TS 26.517?,"According to TS 26.517, the User-Agent request header field for different MBS User Services functions should be formatted with specific elements and values. The general provisions for the User-Agent request header field include the inclusion of a product identifier indicating the type of client function making the request, an optional product-version suffix indicating the version number of the document and the 3GPP release number, and possible comment elements.

"Describe the process and requirements for negotiating and obtaining service API security method information from the CAPIF core function, including the structure and data elements involved.","To negotiate and obtain service API security method information from the CAPIF core function, the API invoker must send an HTTP PUT message to the CAPIF core function. The body of this HTTP PUT message should include a Security Method Request and a Notification Destination URI for security-related notifications. The Security Method Request contains the unique interface details of the service APIs and may include a preferred method for each unique service API interface.

Upon receiving the HTTP PUT message, the CAPIF core function will:
1. Determine the security method for each service API interface.
2. Store the Notification Destination URI for security-related notifications.
3. Create a new resource as defined in the relevant documentation.

Describe the procedures and capabilities related to time synchronization services in 5G systems as specified in the 3GPP documents.,"The 5G system supports time synchronization services that can be activated and deactivated by the Application Function (AF). The procedures and capabilities related to these services are detailed in various 3GPP documents.

Firstly, the authorization of NF Service Consumer requests for subscription, creation, update, activation, and deactivation of time synchronization services is provided. This includes the ability to subscribe to notifications about the capability of the time synchronization service and to manage the configuration of the service.

The AF can use specific procedures for configuring the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) instance in the 5G system or for controlling the 5G access stratum time distribution for a particular User Equipment (UE). These procedures are not intended to be used together, but the activation, modification, and deactivation of the PTP instance can influence the 5G access stratum time distribution for the UEs involved.

The AF has the capability to learn about the availability and capabilities of the 5G system and UEs for time synchronization services. It can control the activation and deactivation of the time synchronization service for targeted UEs using service-specific parameters. These parameters are specified for both PTP-based and 5G access stratum-based time synchronization services.

The AF may subscribe to the availability and capabilities of the 5G system and UEs for time synchronization services. The subscription request can include details such as Data Network Name (DNN), Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI), and a list of UE identities or group identity to limit the subscription to specific UEs.

The Time Synchronization Control and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) exposes the availability and capabilities of the 5G system and UEs for synchronization services to the AF. This includes information about user plane node identities, UE identities, and supported capabilities for PTP time synchronization service.

The AF can request to use specific PTP instance types and other service parameters for controlling the PTP time synchronization service. It can also request to use the 5G access stratum as a time synchronization distribution method, where the time source is provided by the 5G system.

The TSCTSF uses the time synchronization parameters received from the AF to control the PTP time synchronization service and the 5G access stratum time synchronization distribution. For handling PTP traffic, the Policy Control Function (PCF) chooses a 5G Quality Indicator (5QI) and dynamically sets the Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and Maximum Data Burst Volume (MDBV) according to the requirements for the PTP protocol.

The AF may provide a temporal validity condition when activating the time synchronization service, specifying the start-time and stop-time attributes that describe the period when the service is active for the targeted AF sessions. The TSCTSF manages these temporal validity conditions accordingly.

Overall, the procedures and capabilities related to time synchronization services in 5G systems involve detailed authorization processes, configuration and control methods, exposure of capabilities to AF, service-specific parameters, and handling of PTP traffic.","The answer should cover the authorization processes for NF Service Consumer requests, the procedures for configuring and controlling time synchronization services, the capabilities exposed to AF, the service-specific parameters for synchronization, and the handling of (g)PTP traffic. It should also include details on how AF can learn about 5GS/UE availability, control synchronization, and subscribe to services, as well as the temporal validity conditions for synchronization services."
"Describe the behavior and state updates of the receiving UM RLC entity when handling UMD PDUs, including the conditions for reassembly window, reception buffer management, and t-Reassembly timer operations.","The receiving UM RLC entity follows specific procedures and updates state variables when handling UMD PDUs. 

1. **Reassembly Window Conditions**:
   - A Sequence Number (SN) falls within the reassembly window if (RX_Next_Highest – UM_Window_Size) <= SN < RX_Next_Highest.
   - A SN falls outside of the reassembly window otherwise.

2. **Actions Upon Receiving a UMD PDU**:
   - If the UMD PDU header does not contain an SN, the UM RLC entity removes the RLC header and delivers the RLC SDU to the upper layer.
   - If the SN falls within the range (RX_Next_Highest – UM_Window_Size) <= SN < RX_Next_Reassembly, the received UMD PDU is discarded.
   - Otherwise, the received UMD PDU is placed in the reception buffer.

3. **Handling UMD PDUs in the Reception Buffer**:
   - If all byte segments with SN = x are received, the UM RLC entity reassembles the RLC SDU from these segments, removes the RLC headers, and delivers the reassembled RLC SDU to the upper layer.
   - If x = RX_Next_Reassembly, RX_Next_Reassembly is updated to the SN of the first SN > current RX_Next_Reassembly that has not been reassembled and delivered to the upper layer.
   - If x falls outside of the reassembly window, RX_Next_Highest is updated to x + 1, and any UMD PDUs with SN outside of the reassembly window are discarded.
   - If RX_Next_Reassembly falls outside of the reassembly window, it is set to the SN of the first SN >= (RX_Next_Highest – UM_Window_Size) that has not been reassembled and delivered to the upper layer.

4. **t-Reassembly Timer Operations**:
   - If t-Reassembly is running and certain conditions are met (e.g., RX_Timer_Trigger <= RX_Next_Reassembly, RX_Timer_Trigger falls outside of the reassembly window and is not equal to RX_Next_Highest, or RX_Next_Highest = RX_Next_Reassembly + 1 with no missing byte segment), t-Reassembly is stopped and reset.
   - If t-Reassembly is not running and certain conditions are met (e.g., RX_Next_Highest > RX_Next_Reassembly + 1, or RX_Next_Highest = RX_Next_Reassembly + 1 with at least one missing byte segment), t-Reassembly is started, and RX_Timer_Trigger is set to RX_Next_Highest.

5. **Actions When t-Reassembly Expires**:
   - RX_Next_Reassembly is updated to the SN of the first SN >= RX_Timer_Trigger that has not been reassembled.
   - All segments with SN < updated RX_Next_Reassembly are discarded.
   - If RX_Next_Highest > RX_Next_Reassembly + 1, or RX_Next_Highest = RX_Next_Reassembly + 1 with at least one missing byte segment, t-Reassembly is started, and RX_Timer_Trigger is set to RX_Next_Highest.

These procedures ensure proper management of UMD PDUs, efficient reassembly of RLC SDUs, and timely updates to state variables and timers within the UM RLC entity.","The answer should cover:
- The criteria for a SN to be within the reassembly window.
- The actions taken by the UM RLC entity upon receiving a UMD PDU, including delivery, discard, or placement in the reception buffer.
- The detailed process for handling UMD PDUs in the reception buffer, including reassembly and state variable updates.
- The conditions and actions related to the t-Reassembly timer, including when it is started, stopped, or reset.
- The specific actions taken when t-Reassembly expires, including updates to RX_Next_Reassembly and RX_Timer_Trigger."

If the maximum number of allowed retransmissions is reached, the initiating UE shall abort the direct link setup procedure. Additionally, the initiating UE may notify the upper layer that the target UE is unreachable. If the initiating UE is a remote UE requesting link setup to a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, it shall initiate the relay reselection procedure. The maximum number of allowed retransmissions is specific to the UE implementation. If the need to establish a link no longer exists before the procedure is completed, the initiating UE shall abort the procedure.","The answer should include the following key points:

Describe the architecture and procedures for a UE to connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials without registration to 5GS.,"The architecture and procedures for a User Equipment (UE) to connect to a WLAN access network using 5G System (5GS) credentials without registration to 5GS are based on the Non-Seamless WLAN Offload Function (NSWOF). This function interfaces with the WLAN access network using the SWa' reference point and interfaces with the Authentication Server Function (AUSF) using the Nausf Service Based Interface (SBI). The SWa' reference point is similar to the SWa reference point defined in other specifications, with the key difference being that SWa' connects the Untrusted non-3GPP IP Access, possibly via a 3GPP AAA Proxy, to the NSWOF, and uses a Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) instead of an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) user ID.

The reference architecture is depicted in several figures:
- Figure 4.2.15-1 shows the reference architecture for authentication in non-seamless WLAN offload.
- Figure 4.2.15-2 illustrates the service-based reference architecture for the same purpose.
- Figure 4.2.15-3 and Figure 4.2.15-4 present the roaming reference architectures, with Figure 4.2.15-3 showing the reference point representation and Figure 4.2.15-4 showing the service-based representation.

The NSWOF enables a UE to connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials without registering to 5GS. This is achieved through the non-seamless WLAN offload procedure, which allows the UE to obtain a local IP address from the WLAN. If the WLAN is configured as Untrusted Non-3GPP access and supports IEEE 802.1x, the UE may first use the 5G NSWO procedure to establish a connection and obtain a local IP address, and subsequently initiate the Untrusted Non-3GPP Access to gain access to the 5G Core (5GC).

In both roaming and non-roaming scenarios, the NSWOF acts as a 3GPP AAA server towards the WLAN Access, with the distinction that the EAP user ID is a SUCI instead of an IMSI. The roaming architectures include different configurations, with Configuration 2 in Figure 4.2.15-3 being a deployment variant of Configuration 1.

Overall, the NSWOF plays a crucial role in enabling seamless connectivity for UEs to WLAN access networks using 5GS credentials without the need for 5GS registration, supporting both non-seamless WLAN offload and trusted non-3GPP access procedures.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the NSWOF and its role in enabling UE to connect to WLAN using 5GS credentials without registration to 5GS

"Describe the procedures followed by the IP-SM-GW when a Chat Session SIP BYE request is received, including the steps taken if operator policy mandates informing the SMS user of the Chat Session teardown.","When the IP-SM-GW located in either the terminating or originating network receives a Chat Session SIP BYE request to tear down a Chat Session, the procedures followed depend on whether operator policy mandates informing the SMS user of the Chat Session teardown.

In the terminating network, if operator policy requires informing the SMS user, the IP-SM-GW proceeds with the procedures outlined in subclauses 6.1.14.2, 6.1.14.3, and 6.1.14.4. If informing the SMS user is not required, the IP-SM-GW directly proceeds with the procedures in subclause 6.1.14.4.

Similarly, in the originating network, if operator policy mandates informing the SMS user, the IP-SM-GW follows the procedures in subclauses 6.1.16.2, 6.1.16.3, and 6.1.14.4. If informing the SMS user is not required, the IP-SM-GW proceeds with the procedures in subclause 6.1.14.4.

Subclause 6.1.14.4 specifies that the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP BYE request. If the IP-SM-GW has associated a specific MSISDN for the Chat Session, it shall release that MSISDN.

Upon receipt of an MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI parameter set to SMS-DELIVER-REPORT (as per subclause 6.1.14.3.1) or SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT (as per subclause 6.1.16.3), the IP-SM-GW shall proceed with the procedures in subclause 6.1.14.4.

Describe the test procedure for verifying SS-RSRP measurement accuracy on the carrier frequency with CCA as specified in TS 38.533.,"The test procedure for verifying SS-RSRP measurement accuracy on the carrier frequency with CCA as specified in TS 38.533 involves several key steps and requirements. 

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the SS-RSRP measurement accuracy on the carrier frequency with CCA is within the specified limits. This test applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 16 and forward, supporting standalone 2DL CA NR-U and intra-frequency measurements on shared channel access.

Minimum conformance requirements are specified in clauses 11.6.1.0.1 and 11.6.1.0.2 for absolute and relative accuracy. The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.133 clause A.11.6.1.2.

The test description includes supported test configurations, initial conditions, and detailed test procedure steps. Supported test configurations are shown in Table 11.6.1.2.4.1-1, and initial conditions are set according to Table 11.6.1.2.4.1-2. The general test parameter settings are defined in Table 11.6.1.2.5-1.

The detailed test procedure involves deploying three cells: FR1 PCell (Cell 1) on the carrier frequency with CCA, and two cells on the same carrier frequency with CCA transmitting SSBs in DBT windows according to the DL CCA model: SCell (Cell 2) and a neighbor cell (Cell 3). The UE must be in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific parameters as per TS 38.508-1 clause 4.5. The SS transmits an RRCReconfiguration message on Cell 1 configuring the UE to perform intra-frequency measurements in SCC DBT windows. The UE acknowledges the configuration and transmits periodic MeasurementReport messages. The SS checks the SS-RSRP reported values in the periodic MeasurementReport and compares them to the expected SS-RSRP values. The test continues until the confidence level is achieved.

Message contents are defined in clause 11.6.1.2.4.3 with exceptions noted in TS 38.508-1 clause 7.3. Test requirements include primary level settings, absolute and relative accuracy requirements as defined in Tables 11.6.1.2.5-1, 11.6.1.2.5-2, and 11.6.1.2.5-3. For the test to pass, the ratio of successful reported values in each test must be more than 90% with a confidence level of 95%.

"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the I1 session is cleared and subsequently disabled in an ICS UE, including the role of the Location Area Identification information element and the supplementary service invocation process.","The I1 session in an ICS UE is cleared and subsequently disabled under specific conditions. If the ICS UE receives a 'systemFailure' or 'unexpectedDataValue' message, the I1 session is cleared as described in subclause 6.2.3. The I1 session remains disabled until either the UE changes PLMNs, identified by the Mobile Network Code (MNC) received in the Location Area Identification information element, or the UE is turned off.

The Location Area Identification information element provides an unambiguous identification of location areas within the area covered by the 3GPP system. It is a type 3 information element with a length of 6 octets, coded as specified in figure 10.5.3 and table 10.5.3 of TS 24.008.

When the SCC AS wants to add I1 control to an existing end-to-end call that was previously established without using the I1 protocol and invoke a mid-call supplementary service, it follows a specific process. The SCC AS invokes the supplementary service as specified in subclause 6.3, performing standard SIP procedures toward the far end and the MGCF. It then sends an I1 message to the ICS UE specifying the invoked supplementary service, with the message populated according to subclauses 6.2.1.3.2.1 and 6.3. The I1 message includes a new value in the Call-Identifier (Part-2) subfield, with all bits set to '1', and excludes the SCC-AS-id information element.

The LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message, sent by the network to the mobile station, indicates that updating or IMSI attach in the network has been completed. This message is significant in the network-to-mobile station communication, as detailed in table 9.2.15 of TS 24.008.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The specific conditions (systemFailure and unexpectedDataValue) under which the I1 session is cleared and disabled.

What are the procedures and requirements for the MCData client when establishing and handling MSRP connections and MBMS delivery?,"The procedures and requirements for the MCData client when establishing and handling MSRP connections and MBMS delivery are as follows:

1. Establishing MSRP Connection:
   - Upon receiving an indication to establish an MSRP connection for file distribution as the terminating client, the MCData client must act as an MSRP client according to IETF RFC 6135.
   - The client can act either as an active endpoint or a passive endpoint to open the transport connection, following IETF RFC 6135.
   - The MSRP connection must be established according to the parameters in the SDP offer received in the SIP INVITE request, as per IETF RFC 4975.
   - If acting as an active endpoint, the client must send an empty MSRP SEND request to bind the MSRP connection to the MSRP session from the perspective of the passive endpoint, following the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 and IETF RFC 6135.

2. Handling MSRP Session:
   - Once the MSRP session is established, the MCData client must follow the rules and procedures defined in IETF RFC 4975 and IETF RFC 6714 upon receipt of an MSRP request.
   - If an MSRP SEND request indicates the use of chunking, the client must wait until all further MSRP SEND requests for the remaining chunks have been received and reassemble the entire set of MSRP requests into the file before delivering the content to the application.
   - The received content must be handled as described in clause 7.1.3.2.

3. Decoding and Indicating File Download Completion:
   - Upon receiving a file, the MCData client must decode the contents of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-file MIME body.
   - Once all chunks of the file are successfully received, the client must indicate to the signaling plane that the file download is completed.

4. Monitoring MBMS Subchannel:
   - While MBMS delivery is expected, the terminating MCData client must monitor the general-purpose MBMS subchannel.
   - Upon receiving a Map Group To Bearer message over the MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCData client must associate the TMGI in the TMGI field and the MBMS subchannel for media with the MCData group identity in the MCData Group ID field, and start or continue the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.3.
   - Upon receiving an Unmap Group To Bearer message referring to the current communication over an MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface must remove the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for media in the group session identified by the MCData Group ID field, and cease monitoring the associated MBMS bearer and subchannel for media. If the MSRP session is still ongoing, file delivery must resume or continue via the media plane over unicast.

5. Handling (S)RTP Media Packets:
   - While MBMS delivery is expected, the terminating MCData client must monitor the MBMS bearer and subchannel indicated by the Map Group To Bearer message.
   - For each received (S)RTP media packet, until a SIP BYE is received or an implementation-dependent timeout occurs, the client must decapsulate the payload out of the (S)RTP packet, decrypt and validate the payload if SRTP is used, and process the payload as a received MSRP SEND message during the established MSRP session, according to clause 7.1.3.1.","The answer should include the steps for establishing an MSRP connection, including acting as an active or passive endpoint, sending MSRP SEND requests, and handling received MSRP requests. It should also cover the decoding of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-file MIME body and indicating file download completion. Additionally, it should describe the monitoring of MBMS subchannels, associating TMGI with MCData group identity, and handling Map Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer messages. Finally, it should explain the monitoring of MBMS bearer and subchannel, decapsulating and processing (S)RTP media packets, and handling MSRP SEND messages during the established MSRP session."

What are the requirements and functionalities of the MBMS Client in relation to the Hypothetical FEC Decoder and the MBMS RTP Streaming User Service as specified in the 3GPP TS 26.346 and TS 26.347 documents?,"The MBMS Client must adhere to several requirements and functionalities as specified in the 3GPP TS 26.346 and TS 26.347 documents. 

Firstly, the Hypothetical FEC Decoder, as outlined in TS 26.346, is crucial for ensuring packet stream and MBMS receiver conformance. The decoder uses inputs such as the packet stream, transmission time of each packet, initial buffering delay, and SDP for the stream. The buffer size for the hypothetical FEC decoder is set to a maximum of 1 Mbytes, and the buffer occupancy level must not exceed the value of the buf-size parameter in the SDP or the default buffer size if the parameter is absent. The decoder operates by initially emptying the buffer, inserting packets into a FEC source block at their transmission time, and removing non-original UDP packets once the last FEC source and repair packets are transmitted. Original UDP packets are removed and output sequentially based on specific timing conditions and transmission completion of all packets in the same FEC source block. An MBMS client must be capable of receiving and decoding a packet stream that complies with these specifications.

Secondly, the MBMS RTP Streaming User Service, as defined in TS 26.347, provides the MAA with interfaces to access MBMS Streaming Delivery Services. The MAA can request to start or stop any available RTP streaming service and will receive information about the RTP data. The API for these services is defined with the serviceType set to RTP for the service request, and the SDP provided in the sdpURI should be used together with the RTP interface.

Additionally, the MBMS Client should implement the functions of the Hypothetical FEC Decoder and provide the MAA with an SDP that describes the packet stream and the network interface from which the data stream can be received. The MBMS Client may forward packets locally or through the network to the client, modifying the SDP accordingly to ensure compliance with the offered SDP.

Lastly, the MBMS Transparent User Service, also defined in TS 26.347, provides the MAA with interfaces to access MBMS transparent delivery services. The MAA can request to start or stop any available transparent service, with the serviceType set to TRANSPARENT or TRANSPARENT-ROM for the service request. The SDP provided in the sdpURI should be used together with the Packet Data interface. The MBMS Client must provide an interface that ensures the data stream complies with the SDP and offers the network interface for data reception, modifying the SDP as necessary to conform to the session requirements.

In summary, the MBMS Client must implement the Hypothetical FEC Decoder functions, handle buffer size constraints and packet procedures, provide interfaces for RTP streaming and transparent services, and ensure SDP compliance and network interface provisions.","The answer must include details on the Hypothetical FEC decoder's operation, buffer size constraints, and packet handling procedures as specified in TS 26.346. It should also cover the MBMS RTP Streaming User Service interface, service request types, and the use of SDP in the sdpURI as outlined in TS 26.347. Additionally, the answer should describe the MBMS Client's interface requirements for packet stream delivery, including the implementation of Hypothetical FEC Decoder functions and SDP modifications. Finally, the answer should address the MBMS Transparent User Service interface, service request types, and the use of SDP in the sdpURI, along with the MBMS Client's interface requirements for transparent delivery method and network interface provisions."
Describe the structure and components of the VAE_MessageDelivery API URI as defined in 3GPP TS 29.486 and TS 29.501.,"The VAE_MessageDelivery API URI is structured according to the guidelines provided in 3GPP TS 29.486 and TS 29.501. The complete URI structure is defined as follows:

{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>

Each component of the URI is specified as:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts including the scheme ('http' or 'https'), the fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port) as defined in IETF RFC 3986, and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character. The host should be represented by the operator-specific FQDN.
- <apiName>: This defines the name of the API. For the VAE_MessageDelivery API, the apiName is 'vae-message-delivery'.
- <apiVersion>: This indicates the major version of the API. For the VAE_MessageDelivery API, the apiVersion is 'v1'.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 6.1.3 of 3GPP TS 29.486 and specifies the resource URI relative to the API URI.

An example of the VAE_MessageDelivery API URI would be:
'https://operator-specific-fqdn/vae-message-delivery/v1/resource-specific-part'

"Describe the configuration and relationship of channels in the E-DCH testing model as per 3GPP TS 34.123, focusing on MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is entities.","The E-DCH (Enhanced Dedicated Channel) testing model as per 3GPP TS 34.123 involves the configuration and relationship of various channels from logical channels to physical channels, focusing on MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is entities.

For MAC-e/es entities:
- The TTCN writer can define MAC-e/es and multiplex logical channels onto MAC-d flows.
- The E-DCH transport channel and MAC-d flows can be configured.
- Channels such as E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH, E-HICH, E-RGCH, and E-AGCH can be configured.
- MAC-es and the served RLC are cell-independent and are configured using cell-id = -1.
- During reconfigurations, cell changes, and state transitions, relevant counters in the RLC are maintained.
- The E-DCH active set is a subset of the DCH active set, and this must be respected during configuration.
- During active set updating (soft handover), configurations may involve multiple cells under the control of the same or different Node Bs. Only one E-DPDCH is necessary for each Node B.
- The UL-DPCCH is needed as a reference channel for the E-DPCCH and is configured in every cell with an E-DCH, but without the associated transport channel configuration in non-serving cells.

For MAC-i/is entities in DC-HSUPA:
- The TTCN writer can define MAC-i/is and multiplex logical channels onto MAC-d flows.
- The E-DCH transport channel and MAC-d flows can be configured on all cells.
- Channels such as E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH, E-HICH, E-RGCH, and E-AGCH can be configured on both primary and secondary uplink frequencies.
- MAC-is and the served RLC are cell-independent and are configured using cell-id = -1.
- A single MAC-i entity is shared by the primary and secondary serving radio links and is mapped to a NodeB id, connected to the MAC-is entity.
- During active set updating (soft handover) involving multiple Node Bs, two MAC-i entities are configured, but only one is connected to the MAC-is entity.
- The HS-DPCCH channel is configured only in the primary uplink frequency cell.
- The UL-DPCCH is needed as a reference channel for the E-DPCCH and is configured in every cell with an E-DCH.

In summary, both MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is models involve the configuration of various channels and flows, with specific considerations for cell independence, active set updating, and the use of reference channels. The MAC-i/is model in DC-HSUPA introduces the concept of a shared MAC-i entity between primary and secondary serving radio links.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is entities and their roles in E-DCH testing.
  - Details on the configuration of logical channels onto MAC-d flows.

  - Differences between MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is models, including the shared MAC-i entity in DC-HSUPA."
How should an MCVideo client handle an on-demand private call without transmission control?,"An MCVideo client should handle an on-demand private call without transmission control by following the procedures outlined in clause 10.2.2.1.1 with specific exceptions. Firstly, in step 8 of clause 10.2.2.1.1, the MCVideo client should not offer a media-level section for a media-transmission control entity. Secondly, step 9 of clause 10.2.2.1.1 should be ignored. Upon receipt of an initial SIP INVITE request for the private call with an SDP offer that does not include a media-level section for a media-transmission control entity, the MCVideo client should consider it as a request for a private call without transmission control and follow the procedures specified in clause 10.2.2.1.2 for an on-demand session.","The answer must include the specific exceptions to the procedures in clause 10.2.2.1.1, namely not offering a media-level section for a media-transmission control entity in step 8 and ignoring step 9. It should also mention that upon receipt of an initial SIP INVITE request with an SDP offer not including a media-level section for a media-transmission control entity, the MCVideo client should follow the procedures in clause 10.2.2.1.2 for on-demand session."
"Describe the procedures and functionalities related to RTCP Codec Control Commands and Indications as specified in 3GPP TS 23.333, including the roles of MRFC and MRFP, and how these commands are negotiated and utilized.","RTCP Codec Control Commands and Indications, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.333, include feedback messages such as Full Intra Request (FIR), Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate Request (TMMBR), and Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate Notification (TMMBN). These commands are used to manage media streams in conferencing scenarios.

The negotiation of these commands is performed via the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer exchange. Specifically, the RTCP feedback capability attribute 'a=rtcp-fb' is used to indicate support for these commands. Each type of RTCP feedback message is negotiated with a separate 'a=rtcp-fb' attribute line.

The Media Resource Function Controller (MRFC) and the Media Resource Function Processor (MRFP) play crucial roles in handling these commands. When the MRFC receives an SDP offer containing 'a=rtcp-fb' lines with 'CCM' parameters such as 'fir' and 'tmmbr', it includes the 'CCM BASE' information element with these parameters when requesting the MRFP to configure resources. This indicates that the MRFP should be prepared to receive and send the RTCP CCM feedback messages.

The MRFP then assigns resources for the requested RTCP control flow. It may send the RTCP FIR feedback message to request the media sender to send a decoder refresh point, or the RTCP TMMBR feedback message to request the media sender to limit the maximum bit rate for a media stream. Upon receiving the RTCP TMMBR feedback message, the MRFP adjusts the media rate accordingly and responds with the RTCP TMMBN feedback message.

Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) impacts the use of RTCP feedback messages. For instance, the trigger for sending the RTCP TMMBR feedback message can be the reception of RTP packets marked with ECN-CE.

Additionally, the normative specifications for the H.248 Package related to Multi-stream Multiparty Conferencing Media Handling are detailed in TS 29.333 Annex C. These specifications provide guidelines for implementing the procedures and functionalities associated with RTCP Codec Control Commands and Indications.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Explanation of RTCP Codec Control Commands and Indications, including FIR, TMMBR, and TMMBN.

"Describe the procedure for measuring timing advance adjustment accuracy in a single cell test as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521, and explain the role of the timeAlignmentTimer as defined in 3GPP TS 36.321.","The procedure for measuring timing advance adjustment accuracy in a single cell test involves several steps and configurations. The test consists of two successive time periods, T1 and T2, during which timing advance commands are sent to the User Equipment (UE) and Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) are transmitted from the UE and received by the Serving Station (SS). The accuracy of the timing advance adjustment is measured by analyzing the reception of the SRS and the transmit timing.

1. Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF.
2. Set the parameters according to T1 in the specified tables and configure propagation conditions.
3. The SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
4. The UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The SS sends a timing advance command (TA) set to 31, indicating an adjustment of the current NTA value to 0.
6. The UE transmits SRS and adjusts its uplink timing at the beginning of sub-frame n+6 for the TA received in sub-frame n.
7. When T1 expires, the SS switches the TA from T1 to T2.
8. The SS sends a sequence of messages with TA set to 39, indicating an adjustment of the current NTA value to 128.
9. The UE transmits SRS and adjusts its uplink timing at the beginning of sub-frame n+6 for the TA received in sub-frame n.
10. The accuracy of the timing advance adjustment is measured to ensure it is within ± 4.5 × TS of the signalled timing advance value.
11. The number of successful or failed tests is recorded based on the accuracy measurement.
12. The SS transmits an RRCConnectionRelease message to release the RRC connection.
13. After the RRC connection release, the SS either transmits a Paging message or switches off and on the UE to ensure it is in State 3A-RF.
14. Steps 2-13 are repeated until the confidence level is achieved.

The UE Time Alignment Timer (timeAlignmentTimer IE) is configured to ensure it does not expire during the test. The timeAlignmentTimer, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.321, controls how long the MAC entity considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated Timing Advance Group (TAG) to be uplink time aligned. The timer is started or restarted when a Timing Advance Command MAC control element is received, and it is stopped when the contention resolution is not successful. Upon expiry, the timer triggers actions such as flushing HARQ buffers, releasing PUCCH/SPUCCH and SRS, and clearing downlink assignments and uplink grants. The timer ensures that the UE maintains accurate uplink timing alignment, which is crucial for the timing advance adjustment accuracy measurement.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Detailed steps for the single cell test procedure, including the setup, timing advance commands, SRS transmission, and measurement criteria.

Describe the process and key elements involved in the registration of API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function.,"The registration of API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function involves several key steps and elements as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.222. The process begins with the API management function sending a registration request to the CAPIF core function. This request includes a list of information about all the API provider domain functions that need to be registered.

Upon receiving the registration request, the CAPIF core function validates the request and generates identity and other security-related information for each API provider domain function listed. This generated information is then sent back to the API management function in a registration response message.

The API management function subsequently configures the received information to the individual API provider domain functions, completing the registration process.

The API operation involved in this process is named Register_API_Provider. It is used to register the API provider domain functions as authorized users of the CAPIF. The known consumer of this API operation is the API management function. The inputs for this operation are detailed in subclause 8.28.2.1, and the outputs are described in subclause 8.28.2.2.

Describe the structure and notation conventions for M3AP protocol messages and information elements as specified in TS 36.444.,"The structure and notation conventions for M3AP protocol messages and information elements as specified in TS 36.444 are detailed as follows:

1. **Notation Conventions**:
   - **Procedure**: When referring to an elementary procedure, the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word 'procedure', e.g., MBMS procedure.
   - **Message**: When referring to a message, the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word 'message', e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
   - **Information Element (IE)**: When referring to an information element, the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation 'IE', e.g., Information Element IE.
   - **Value of an IE**: When referring to the value of an information element, the 'Value' is written as specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., 'Value'.

2. **Structure of Messages and Information Elements**:
   - Subclauses 9.1 and 9.2 describe the structure of the messages and information elements required for the M3AP protocol in tabular format. The attributes used for the tabular description include Presence, Range Criticality, and Assigned Criticality.
   - Subclause 9.2 presents the M3AP IE definitions in tabular format, while subclause 9.3 provides the corresponding ASN.1 definition. In case of contradiction between the tabular format and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.

3. **Principles for Ordering Bits in Bitstrings**:
   - When specifying information elements represented by bitstrings, the following principles apply:
     - The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB).
     - The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB).
     - When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information.

4. **ASN.1 Definition and Conformance**:
   - The M3AP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.691 and ITU-T Rec. X.680. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of M3AP messages, which can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1.
   - For this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a M3AP message according to the PDU definitions module with specific rules:
     - IEs shall be ordered in the order they appear in object set definitions.
     - Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value 'mandatory'. An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value 'optional' or 'conditional'.
     - If a M3AP message is not constructed as defined, it shall be considered as an Abstract Syntax Error and handled accordingly.

"Describe the registration and PDU session establishment procedures for a UE with a subscription in an SNPN, including the handling of subscription data and authentication processes.","The registration and PDU session establishment procedures for a UE with a subscription in an SNPN can be categorized into two main approaches: pre-stored subscription data and on-demand subscription data.

1. **Pre-stored Subscription Data:**
   - **Registration Request:** The UE selects the SNPN as the serving network and sends a Registration Request message, including its UE identifier (UE-ID).
   - **Authentication:** The AMF triggers the primary network authentication procedure, and the UE is authenticated by the AAA server using any EAP authentication method. The AAA server sends the authentication result to the AMF, which may include key material and the SI-SUPI.
   - **NAS Security Setup:** The AMF performs NAS security mode command with the UE to set up NAS security using the key material received during authentication.
   - **Subscription Data Retrieval:** The AMF uses the SI-SUPI to retrieve subscription data from the UDM/UDR. The UE-ID is used for security procedures and communication during re-authentication/authorization.
   - **PDU Session Establishment:** The UE may request PDU session establishment, and the AMF selects an appropriate SMF, including the SI-SUPI in the message. The SMF uses the SI-SUPI to retrieve the UE's session management subscription data from the UDM.
   - **Benefits:** This approach reduces UE-specific signaling exchange between the SNPN and the SP to the primary authentication and authorization procedure. Once authentication is completed, the SNPN can serve the UE without further interaction with the SP.

2. **On-demand Subscription Data:**
   - **Registration Request:** Similar to the pre-stored approach, the UE sends a Registration Request message to the SNPN.
   - **Authentication:** The AAA server sends the authentication result to the AMF, which may include key material and subscription retrieval parameters such as an access token and subscription-data-URI.
   - **Subscription Data Retrieval:** The AMF initiates UE subscription data retrieval with the UDM using the subscription retrieval parameters. The UDM retrieves the subscription data from the AAA server and generates a subscription identifier (SI-SUPI).
   - **Subscription Data Storage:** The UDM responds to the AMF with the UE subscription data and the subscription identifier. The AMF stores the received data and uses both UE-ID and SI-SUPI for further procedures.
   - **PDU Session Establishment:** The UE may request PDU session establishment, and the AMF selects an appropriate SMF, including the SI-SUPI in the message. The SMF uses the SI-SUPI to retrieve the UE's session management subscription data from the UDM.
   - **Benefits:** This approach allows dynamic updates to the UE service subscription data, enabling the SNPN to handle changes in subscription data efficiently.

3. **Quota Management in Roaming Scenarios:**
   - A local quota of 'max number of PDU Sessions per network slice' is allocated to the vPLMN per SLA agreement and stored in the vNSQ. During roaming, the quota monitoring and enforcement are done by the vNSQ entity.

Overall, both approaches ensure secure and efficient handling of subscription data and authentication processes, with specific benefits tailored to the needs of the network and the UE.","The answer must include details on the registration request process, authentication methods, NAS security setup, subscription data retrieval and storage, PDU session establishment, and the benefits of each approach (pre-stored vs on-demand subscription data).

The UE is required to implement the MSUA role, which involves subscribing to or requesting information about status changes of a message account from a Message Waiting Indicator Application Server (MWI AS). 

When the MSUA intends to subscribe for status information changes, it generates a SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with RFC 6665 and RFC 3842, and follows the procedures outlined in 3GPP TS 24.229. If the UE receives a 489 (Bad Event) response or a 405 (Method Not Allowed) response to the SUBSCRIBE request, it must not retry the request until the public user identity is de-registered from the IMS. These responses indicate that MWI is not supported in the network.

These requirements apply to all types of repeaters and configurations as specified by the manufacturer's specifications.

Subclause 9.2.1.1 details the requirements for Category A limits for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329. At maximum repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per channel, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the limits specified in table 9.5. These requirements also apply at maximum gain without WCDMA signals in the pass band. Additionally, when the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB compared to the input level producing the maximum rated output power, the requirement must still be met.

Subclause 9.2.1.2 outlines the requirements for Category B limits for spurious emissions, also defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329. Similar to Category A, at maximum repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated power output per channel, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the limits specified in table 9.5A for both the down-link and up-link. These requirements also apply at maximum gain without WCDMA signals in the pass band. When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB compared to the input level producing the maximum rated output power, the requirement must still be met. Additionally, subclause 9.2.1.2 mentions several void tables (9.6, 9.6A, 9.6B, 9.6C, 9.6D, 9.6E, and 9.6F).","The answer should include the general applicability of subclauses 9.2.1.1 and 9.2.1.2 to all types of repeaters and configurations. It should detail the specific requirements for Category A limits, including the conditions at maximum repeater gain with WCDMA signals, maximum rated output power per channel, and increased power levels. Similarly, it should cover the specific requirements for Category B limits, including the same conditions. The answer should also mention the void tables in subclause 9.2.1.2."

For inter RAT handover from GERAN to LTE, the MME performs the cause value mapping when it receives the GTPv2 Forward Relocation Request message from the S4-SGSN or the GTPv1 Forward Relocation Request message from Gn/Gp-SGSN. This mapping is defined in Table 5.4.1 of TS 29.010. If the handover fails in LTE access, the MME maps the S1AP cause in the S1AP Handover Failure message to a RANAP cause using Table 6.2.1. The MME then uses the RANAP cause in the GTPv1 Forward Relocation Response message to the Gn/Gp-SGSN, which maps the RANAP cause to a BSSGP cause as per Table 15.2 in TS 29.060 and sends this BSSGP cause in the BSSGP PS Handover Required Nack message.

For inter RAT handover from LTE to GERAN, the MME performs the cause value mapping when it receives the GTPv2 Forward Relocation Response message from the S4-SGSN or the GTPv1 Forward Relocation Response message from the Gn/Gp-SGSN. This mapping is defined in Table 5.4.2 of TS 29.010. If the handover fails in GERAN, the MME maps the S1AP cause in the S1AP Handover Required message to a RANAP cause using Table 6.2.2. The MME then uses the RANAP cause in the GTPv1 Forward Relocation Request message to the Gn/Gp-SGSN, which maps the RANAP cause to a BSSGP cause as per Table 15.3 in TS 29.060 and sends this BSSGP cause in the BSSGP PS Handover Request message.

Similarly, the S4-SGSN performs cause value mapping for inter RAT handover scenarios. For GERAN to LTE handover, the S4-SGSN maps the cause values when it receives the GTPv2 Forward Relocation Response message from the MME, as defined in Table 6.3.1 of TS 29.010. For LTE to GERAN handover, the S4-SGSN maps the cause values when it receives the GTPv2 Forward Relocation Request message from the MME, as defined in Table 6.3.2 of TS 29.010.

The APN Restriction information element, as defined in TS 29.060, indicates the level of restriction imposed on primary PDP Contexts created to the associated APN. When used in messages from the GGSN to the SGSN, it contains an unsigned integer value indicating the level of restriction. When used in messages from the SGSN to GGSN, it indicates the highest level of restriction type for all currently active PDP Contexts associated with the subscriber. The meaning of the value contained within the IE is as defined in clause 15.4 of TS 23.060. The structure of the APN Restriction IE is detailed in Figure 62b of TS 29.060.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The purpose of mapping cause values between BSSGP and S1AP in inter RAT handover scenarios.
- Detailed explanation of the mapping process for GERAN to LTE and LTE to GERAN handovers, referencing Tables 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 6.3.1, and 6.3.2.
- The role of the MME and S4-SGSN in the mapping process.
- Explanation of the APN Restriction information element, including its structure and usage in messages between GGSN and SGSN, and the meaning of the restriction levels."
Describe the impact of different pulse shapes on network performance and legacy user experience based on the findings from TS 45.913.,"The study in TS 45.913 evaluated the impact of different pulse shapes on network performance and legacy user experience through various scenarios and metrics.

Document 1 discusses the suppression of candidate pulse shapes after the power amplifier (PA) with a linearised GMSK filter truncated to ±160 kHz. It highlights that the 50 dB requirement is not fully met in some cases, but verification with an actual PA rather than a PA model could still keep these pulse shapes as candidates.

Document 2 focuses on the impact of pulse shapes on legacy speech users. It uses the criteria for Bad Quality Calls (BQC), where the average Frame Erasure Rate (FER) should be greater than 1% except in the WIDER-1 network scenario where it is greater than 2%. The target percentage of BQCs is less than 5%, which is mostly met across scenarios. The findings indicate that at equal PS load, the speech quality of legacy users is not degraded by either wide pulse shape, and any increase in adjacent-channel interference (ACI) from the wide pulse is compensated by a reduction in activity time. However, supporting more data users with wide pulses would impact legacy speech users. At maximum PS load, a small impact on legacy voice users is observed only in the WIDER-1 network configuration.

Document 3 evaluates connection throughput at different percentiles (10%, 50%, and 90%). At equal PS load, the median throughput for the reference pulse is about 35 kbit/s/TS, with candidate pulse #2 showing a 40% gain and candidate pulse #3 showing a 35% gain. At maximum PS loads, the median throughput gain is lower at about 20% for both pulse shapes, but there is a data capacity gain of about 20%.

Document 4 summarizes the evaluation scenarios, assumptions, and findings. The study considered different network scenarios (WIDER-1, WIDER-2, and WIDER-3) and deployment strategies. Assumptions included 100% penetration of the EGPRS2-B service, saturation of PS traffic load, and 2% blocking of CS traffic load. Two pulse shapes (Candidate #2 and Candidate #3) with different spectral properties were evaluated, showing lower inter-symbol interference and lower adjacent-channel protection. The throughput performance of EGPRS2-B users demonstrated gains of 13-27% in median throughput and 16-24% in data capacity, depending on the network scenario and pulse shape. The impact on legacy user speech quality was minimal or acceptable, even at network saturation levels, due to fewer PS timeslots compared to CS timeslots.

Overall, the findings from TS 45.913 indicate that while wide pulse shapes can improve data throughput and capacity, they have a minimal or acceptable impact on legacy speech users, especially when network saturation is considered.","The answer should include details on the suppression of candidate pulse shapes and the 50 dB requirement from Document 1. It should cover the impact on legacy speech users, criteria for BQC, and the target percentage of BQCs from Document 2. From Document 3, it should discuss the connection throughput at different percentiles, throughput gains, and data capacity gains for candidate pulses. Finally, it should summarize the evaluation scenarios, assumptions, pulse shapes, link level performance, throughput performance, and impact on legacy user speech quality from Document 4."
"Describe the positioning methods and their operations as specified in 3GPP TS 36.305, including OTDOA and TBS.","The 3GPP TS 36.305 specification outlines two primary positioning methods: downlink Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) and Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS).

The downlink (OTDOA) positioning method involves the User Equipment (UE) measuring the timing of downlink signals received from multiple Transmission Points (TPs). The UE uses assistance data received from the positioning server to measure the timing of these signals, and the resulting measurements are used to determine the UE's location relative to the neighboring TPs. The detailed operation of the OTDOA positioning method is described in clause 8.2 of the specification.

The Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS) consists of a network of ground-based transmitters that broadcast signals specifically for positioning purposes. The current types of TBS positioning signals include Metropolitan Beacon System (MBS) signals and Positioning Reference Signals (PRS). The UE measures the received TBS signals, optionally aided by assistance data, to calculate its location or to send measurements to the positioning server for position calculation. The operation of the TBS positioning method based on MBS signals is detailed in clause 8.9, while PRS-based TBS is part of the downlink (OTDOA) positioning method and is described in clause 8.2.

The specification supports three positioning modes for TBS:
1. UE-Assisted: The UE performs TBS measurements with or without assistance from the network and sends these measurements to the E-SMLC (Enhanced Serving Mobile Location Center) where the position calculation takes place, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources.
2. UE-Based: The UE performs TBS measurements and calculates its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources.
3. Standalone: The UE performs TBS measurements and calculates its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources, without network assistance.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - Explanation of the downlink (OTDOA) positioning method, including how the UE measures timing of signals and uses assistance data from the positioning server.
  - Description of the operation of OTDOA positioning as per clause 8.2.
  - Overview of Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS), including the types of signals used (MBS and PRS).
  - Detailed explanation of the operation of TBS positioning based on MBS signals as per clause 8.9.
  - Clarification that PRS-based TBS is part of OTDOA positioning and described in clause 8.2.
  - Description of the three positioning modes supported by TBS (UE-Assisted, UE-Based, Standalone)."
Describe the procedures and exceptions for ICE handling by the P-CSCF in different transport protocols as defined in TS 24.229.,"The procedures and exceptions for ICE handling by the P-CSCF in different transport protocols as defined in TS 24.229 are as follows:

1. **Standard ICE Procedures for UDP Based Streams (TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.2)**:
   The P-CSCF follows standard ICE procedures for UDP based streams. These procedures involve the P-CSCF acting as an ICE agent to facilitate the establishment of media streams using the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) framework.

2. **Exceptions for ICE Lite Procedures for UDP Based Streams (TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.3)**:
   When the P-CSCF uses ICE lite procedures for UDP based streams, the procedures are similar to those described in subclause 6.7.2.7.2, with the following exceptions:
   - The P-CSCF always acts as an ICE controlled entity towards both the offerer and the answerer.
   - The P-CSCF requests the IMS-ALG to perform ICE lite candidate selection procedures as defined in RFC 8445.

3. **Disabling ICE Procedures for TCP Based Streams (TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.4.1)**:
   For TCP based streams, where TCP is indicated as the transport protocol in the m-line, the P-CSCF disables ICE procedures. Instead, the P-CSCF uses the mechanism defined in RFC 4145 for establishing TCP based streams, as further detailed in RFC 6544. This approach ensures proper handling and establishment of TCP based media streams.

4. **Handling of TCP Candidates for UDP Based Streams (TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.4.1)**:
   An entity that supports ICE continues the ICE procedures for UDP based streams, even if no candidates are provided for TCP based streams. The handling of TCP candidates for UDP based streams is described in subclause 6.7.2.7.2.

These guidelines ensure that the P-CSCF can effectively manage media stream establishment using different transport protocols while adhering to the defined standards and procedures.","The answer should cover the standard ICE procedures for UDP based streams as described in TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.2, the specific exceptions when ICE lite procedures are used by the P-CSCF as per TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.3, the disabling of ICE procedures for TCP based streams and the alternative mechanisms defined in RFC 4145 and RFC 6544 as per TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.4.1, and the handling of TCP candidates for UDP based streams as noted in TS 24.229 6.7.2.7.4.1."
Explain the use and syntax of the Response-Source header field in SIP error responses as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229.,"The Response-Source header field in SIP error responses is used to provide information about the sender of the error response. This header field can be included by a SIP User Agent (UA) or SIP proxy when responding to a SIP request with an error response. The purpose of this header field is to identify the SIP capable functional entity that is sending the error response using a URN value.

The ABNF syntax for the Response-Source header field is specified as follows:
Response-Source = \","The answer should include the following key points: 
  - The purpose of the Response-Source header field in SIP error responses.
  - The ABNF syntax and structure of the Response-Source header field, including the URN values and their definitions.
  - How a UA should use and handle the Response-Source header field.
  - How a proxy should use and handle the Response-Source header field.
  - Examples of the Response-Source header field parameter values."
How are PDCP PDUs with invalid or unexpected PDU Types handled according to the 3GPP TS 25.323 specifications?,"According to the 3GPP TS 25.323 specifications, the handling of PDCP PDUs with invalid or unexpected PDU Types involves several steps and conditions. Firstly, the PDU type field, which indicates the PDCP Data PDU type, is 3 bits long. If a PDCP entity receives a PDCP PDU with a PDU Type set to Reserved, it shall discard the PDCP PDU. Additionally, if the PDCP entity is not configured for lossless SRNS Relocation or lossless DL RLC PDU size change and receives a PDCP SeqNum PDU, it shall discard the PDCP SeqNum PDU.

For radio bearers configured to perform PDCP Unrecoverable Error Detection, the process is more detailed. If the PDCP entity receives 2 or 3 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an unexpected or invalid PDU Type or PID value, the UE PDCP entity may indicate PDCP Unrecoverable Error to the upper layer. If the PDCP entity receives 4 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an unexpected or invalid PDU Type or PID value, the UE PDCP entity shall indicate PDCP Unrecoverable Error to the upper layer. 

It is important to note that PDCP unrecoverable error detection is performed before the invalid PDU type check specified in subclause 9.1. Furthermore, PDCP unrecoverable error detection in the UE can only detect the problem in the downlink. Until the UE receives 4 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an unexpected or invalid PDU Type or PID value, the UE may apply a self-recovery mechanism, such as indicating to the RLC layer that the HFN can be incremented.","The answer should include the length and purpose of the PDU type field, the actions taken when a PDCP PDU with a Reserved PDU Type is received, the conditions under which PDCP SeqNum PDUs are discarded, and the process for detecting and handling PDCP Unrecoverable Errors. It should also mention the sequence of error detection and the scope of detection (downlink only)."
"Describe the APIs related to File Delivery Application Service in 3GPP TS 26.347, including their input and output parameters.","The 3GPP TS 26.347 specification defines several APIs related to the File Delivery Application Service, each with specific input and output parameters:

1. **getFdServices() API**:
   - **Input Parameters**: None.

These APIs collectively manage the retrieval, capture, and listing of files associated with the File Delivery Application Service in the 3GPP TS 26.347 specification.","The answer should cover the following points:
- The getFdServices() API does not have any input parameters and returns a list of available File Delivery Application Services with detailed descriptions of each service.
- The startFdCapture() API requires serviceId, fileUri, disableFileCopy, and captureOnce as input parameters.
- The stopFdCapture() API uses the same parameters as the startFdCapture() API.
- The getFdAvailableFileList() API requires serviceId as an input parameter and returns a list of fileUri records."
Describe the media plane control mechanisms and capability functions for SDS and FD in MCData as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582.,"The media plane control mechanisms in MCData involve interactions between the MCData server and the MCData UE, where the MCData server hosts capability functions for Short Data Service (SDS) and File Distribution (FD), and the MCData UE incorporates the MCData client. The MCData user or user application can feed or consume data through these capability functions.

The MCData server's capability functions are divided into controlling and participating MCData functions. The controlling MCData function manages the distribution of data, while the participating MCData function forwards data to the controlling function and serves one or more MCData clients. Depending on the deployment, the controlling MCData function may communicate with multiple participating functions, and if co-located, they act as a single entity.

For SDS, the capability function in the MCData server includes SDS distribution and Transmission/Reception control. SDS data consists of short data such as text, hypertext, binary strings, or location information. This data follows a path from the originating MCData client to the terminating clients, as outlined in the media plane control mechanisms.

For FD, the capability function in the MCData server includes FD function and Transmission/Reception control. FD data consists of files, which follow a similar transmission path from the originating MCData client to the terminating clients.

In the media plane, the MCData client and the controlling MCData function act as Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) clients. If a participating MCData function is present as a separate entity, it acts as an MSRP relay, facilitating the communication between the controlling function and the MCData clients.","The answer should include details on how media plane control is conducted between the MCData server and MCData UE, specifying the roles of controlling and participating MCData functions. It should explain the capability functions for SDS and FD, including the types of data handled (short data for SDS and files for FD) and the transmission paths from originating to terminating MCData clients. Additionally, the roles of MSRP clients and relays in the media plane should be covered."
Describe the role and handling of the PROGRESS message in the call establishment and release process.,"The PROGRESS message plays a crucial role in the call establishment and release process within the PLMN/ISDN environment. The network may send a progress indicator information element to the calling mobile station either in an appropriate call control message if a state change is required (e.g., ALERTING or CONNECT) or in the PROGRESS message if no state change is appropriate. This progress indicator information element shall contain progress description value #32 'Call is end-to-end ISDN/PLMN'.

At any time during the establishment or release of a call and during an active call, the network may send a PROGRESS message to the mobile station. Upon receipt of a PROGRESS message during the establishment or release of a call, the mobile station is required to stop all call control timers related to that call. Notably, if the PROGRESS message is received before the CALL PROCEEDING message, the mobile station will not start timer T310 upon receipt of the CALL PROCEEDING message. This ensures that the mobile station correctly handles the timing and state transitions during the call setup and release phases.","The answer should explain the conditions under which the network sends a PROGRESS message and the impact on the mobile station's call control timers. It should also mention the specific progress description value #32 'Call is end-to-end ISDN/PLMN' and the scenarios where the PROGRESS message is used instead of other call control messages. Additionally, the answer should cover the behavior of the mobile station upon receiving the PROGRESS message, particularly in relation to timer T310."
Describe the process and criteria for PLMN selection and cell camping as specified in 3GPP TS 25.304.,"The process and criteria for PLMN selection and cell camping as specified in 3GPP TS 25.304 involve several key steps and conditions:

1. **Scanning RF Channels and Identifying PLMNs**:
   - The User Equipment (UE) scans all RF channels in the UTRA bands according to its capabilities to find available Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs).
   - On each carrier, the UE searches for the strongest cell and reads its system information to determine the PLMN to which the cell belongs.
   - If the UE can read one or several PLMN identities in the strongest cell, each found PLMN is reported to the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) as a high-quality PLMN, provided that the following high-quality criteria are met:
     - For an FDD cell, the measured primary Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) value must be greater than or equal to -95 dBm.
     - For a TDD cell, the measured Primary Common Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH) RSCP must be greater than or equal to -84 dBm.
   - PLMNs that do not meet the high-quality criteria but whose identities can be read by the UE are reported to the NAS along with their respective RSCP values.

2. **Entering the 'Any Cell Selection' State**:
   - The UE enters the 'Any cell selection' state if the NAS indicates that a location registration (LR) is rejected, except for specific causes (#12, #14, #15, or #25).
   - If the LR is rejected with one of these specific causes, the UE follows the behavior specified in the relevant documents.
   - In this state, the UE attempts to find an acceptable cell of any PLMN to camp on, trying all Radio Access Technologies (RATs) supported by the UE and prioritizing the search for high-quality cells.

3. **Finding an Acceptable Cell to Camp On**:
   - When the UE is not camped on any cell, it remains in the 'Any cell selection' state until it finds an acceptable cell.
   - The UE searches for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the provided Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) ID if one is provided by the NAS as part of PLMN selection.
   - Once an acceptable cell is found, the UE informs the NAS and camps on the cell to obtain limited service, entering the 'Camped on any cell' state.
   - The subsequent actions of the NAS regarding PLMN selection are specified in the relevant documents.

Overall, the process ensures that the UE efficiently scans for available networks, prioritizes high-quality connections, and handles specific conditions for location registration rejections to maintain connectivity.","The answer should include the following key details:
1. The process of scanning RF channels to find available PLMNs and the criteria for reporting high quality PLMNs based on RSCP values for FDD and TDD cells.
2. The conditions that lead the UE to enter the 'Any cell selection' state, particularly in cases of location registration rejection with specific causes.
3. The procedure for the UE to find an acceptable cell to camp on when it is not camped on any cell, including the prioritization of high quality cells and the search across all supported RATs."
Compare the impacts and dependencies of MP-QUIC and QUIC solutions on 5GS entities as described in the 3GPP TS 23.700 documents.,"The impacts and dependencies of MP-QUIC and QUIC solutions on 5GS entities are detailed in the 3GPP TS 23.700 documents. 

For MP-QUIC:
- **SMF**: Supports the selection of UPF based on its MP-QUIC capability.
- **PCF**: Authorizes MP-QUIC functionality steering method for the SDF.
- **UPF**: Supports MP-QUIC proxy functionality, establishes MP-QUIC connection with the UE, and adds/removes MP-QUIC header before forwarding packets.
- **UE**: Supports MP-QUIC functionality, establishes MP-QUIC connection with UPF per IP flow, and handles uplink and downlink traffic encapsulation and decapsulation.

It should also cover the required enhancements to SM NAS protocol, N5 and N4 interfaces, Npcf service for both solutions. Additionally, the dependencies on relevant IETF drafts and the need for IETF support for NULL encryption connections should be discussed. The answer should highlight the additional impacts and dependencies for non-transparent proxy solutions involving the MASQUE protocol."
Describe the procedures involved in the 3GPP UAV presence monitoring mode operation as outlined in TS 23.256 5.3.3.,"The 3GPP UAV presence monitoring mode operation involves several key procedures as outlined in TS 23.256 5.3.3:

1. **Initiation of UAV Presence Monitoring Request**: The UAV presence monitoring request is initiated by the USS via the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation to the UAS NF/NEF. This request includes the GPSI corresponding to the target UAV, geographic area information (e.g., longitude/latitude, zip code), and an indication of reliable UE location information required. Optionally, it may also include a policy or rule indicating the 3GPP network's corresponding action when an Area of Interest (AOI) event is detected, such as revoking the connectivity between the UAV and its controller.

2. **Mapping of Geographical Area**: The UAS NF/NEF maps the geographical area into an area of interest represented by a list of Cell IDs, gNB IDs, or TAIs. It then determines the relevant NF (AMF or GMLC) for location reporting based on the UAV's capability, network capability, and geographic area information.

3. **Obtaining UE Presence Status**:
   - If the geographic area info can be mapped to a 3GPP defined area and the relevant NF is determined as AMF, the UAS NF/NEF maps the GPSI to SUPI and provides the SUPI and the mapped 3GPP defined area to the AMF to obtain the UE presence status using the Area of Interest mechanism.
   - If the geographic area info cannot be mapped to a 3GPP defined area and the relevant NF is determined as GMLC, the UAS NF/NEF uses the GMLC-based procedure for configuring presence monitoring. This is preferable if presence monitoring is needed with finer granularity than the Cell ID. The UAS NF/NEF invokes the Ngmlc_Location_ProvideLocation Request service operation towards the GMLC, including the geographical area of interest. The UAS NF/NEF may first use the AMF-based procedure before invoking the GMLC service.

4. **Reporting UAV Presence Monitoring Results**: The UAS NF/NEF receives the UAV presence monitoring report from AMF or GMLC and reports the UAV presence in the geographic area to the USS, including its GPSI. Optionally, the CAA Level UAV ID may also be provided in the report.

5. **Optional Policy-Based Actions**: If policies have been provided by the USS in the initial request, the UAS NF/NEF will take appropriate network layer actions when the UAV presence in the monitoring area matches a policy. This includes indicating the SMF (via PCF) to revoke the connectivity between the UAV and its controller. The UAS NF/NEF uses the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to provide relevant parameters to the PCF, which then issues a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request with updated policy information about the PDU Session.

These procedures ensure comprehensive monitoring and management of UAV presence within the specified geographic areas, leveraging both AMF and GMLC capabilities as needed.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how USS initiates the UAV presence monitoring request and the information included in the request.
  - Description of how UAS NF/NEF maps the geographical area into an area of interest and determines the relevant NF.
  - Detailed steps for obtaining UE presence status using AMF or GMLC, including the conditions for choosing between AMF and GMLC.
  - Process of reporting UAV presence monitoring results to USS.
  - Explanation of optional policy-based actions and how they are implemented by UAS NF/NEF and PCF."
What are the key performance requirements for fine time assistance capable UEs as specified in the 3GPP documents?,"The key performance requirements for fine time assistance capable User Equipment (UEs) are outlined in several 3GPP documents. Firstly, the use of fine time assistance to improve the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) performance of the UE is optional, even when signaled by the network. There are minimum performance requirements defined for all UEs, and additional requirements for those capable of fine time assistance. 

For UEs supporting A-GPS L1 C/A only, the specific requirements are detailed in subclause 5.1.2, where 8 satellites are generated for the terminal, and the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel model is used. For UEs supporting other GNSSs, the requirements are specified in clause 6.1.2, where 6 satellites are generated for single and dual constellations, and 7 satellites for triple constellations, also using the AWGN channel model.

Additionally, the accuracy and response time requirements for the first fix position estimates are provided in TS 37.571, which references TS 36.171 clauses 5.1.2 and 6.1.2. These requirements include specific parameters for sensitivity fine time assistance across various sub-tests, ensuring that the position estimates meet the defined accuracy and response time criteria.

In summary, the key performance requirements for fine time assistance capable UEs include the number of satellites used in different constellations, the use of the AWGN channel model, and the accuracy and response time requirements for the first fix position estimates, as specified in the relevant clauses of TS 36.171 and TS 37.571.","The answer should include the distinction between UEs with and without fine time assistance, the specific performance requirements for fine time assistance capable UEs, the number of satellites used in different constellations, the use of the AWGN channel model, and the accuracy and response time requirements for the first fix position estimates. Additionally, it should reference the relevant clauses from TS 36.171 and TS 37.571."
Describe the process and information flow involved in the deletion of a TSC stream as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434.,"The deletion of a TSC stream as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 involves several steps and information flows between the VAL server and the NRM server. The process begins with the VAL server sending a TSC stream deletion request to the NRM server, as outlined in Table 14.3.2.27-1. This request includes the VAL Stream ID, which is used to identify the specific stream to be deleted.

Upon receiving the request, the NRM server identifies the MAC addresses of the DS-TTs involved in the stream based on the stored information for the VAL Stream ID. The NRM server then triggers the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation via Nxx, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502, to delete both the uplink (UL) QoS flow (from the sender UE to the UPF/bridge) and the downlink (DL) QoS flows (from the UPF/bridge to the receiver UE) from the PDU sessions of the UEs referred to by the VAL Stream ID.

After completing the deletion process, the NRM server sends a TSC stream deletion response to the VAL server, detailing the result of the deletion for the VAL Stream ID, as described in Table 14.3.2.28-1.

The API operation for this process is named TSC_Stream_Deletion, with the VAL server being the known consumer. The inputs for this API operation are detailed in subclause 14.3.2.27, and the outputs are described in subclause 14.3.2.28. For a comprehensive understanding of the usage of this API operation, subclause 14.3.7.4 provides detailed procedural information.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The initial request from the VAL server to the NRM server to delete a TSC stream, including the VAL Stream ID.
  - The identification of MAC addresses involved in the stream by the NRM server.
  - The triggering of the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation by the NRM server to delete QoS flows.
  - The response from the NRM server to the VAL server with the result of the deletion.
  - The API operation name, inputs, outputs, and known consumers as described in TS 23.434."
"What is the significance of the CFN (Connection Frame Number) in the context of radio frames for uplink and downlink transmissions, and how is it calculated?","The CFN (Connection Frame Number) is crucial in identifying the specific radio frame in which the first data is received on the uplink or transmitted on the downlink. This is particularly important when a transport bearer is used by multiple FACH channels with the IP multicast option. The calculation of the CFN is given by the formula: CFN = (MFN – CFN Offset) mod 256. Here, MFN represents the value of the CFN field in the data frame, and CFN Offset is a parameter indicated by the RNC. The value range and field length of CFN depend on the transport channel being used. For PCH (Paging Channel), the value range is {0..4095} with a field length of 12 bits. For other transport channels, the value range is {0..255} with a field length of 8 bits. This calculation ensures proper synchronization and timing for data transmission and reception across the network.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of the CFN (Connection Frame Number) and its role in identifying the radio frame for uplink and downlink transmissions. It should describe the calculation formula CFN = (MFN – CFN Offset) mod 256, and define MFN and CFN Offset. Additionally, it should specify the value ranges and field lengths for different transport channels (PCH and others). References to subclause 6.2.7.3 should be acknowledged."
How does the Mobile Station (MS) derive the C value and measure channel quality in packet transfer mode according to 3GPP TS 43.064?,"According to 3GPP TS 43.064, the Mobile Station (MS) derives the C value and measures channel quality in packet transfer mode through a series of steps and processes:

1. **Measuring Signal Strength**:
   - In packet idle mode, the MS measures the signal strength of the PCCCH or BCCH if PCCCH is not available.
   - In packet transfer mode, the MS measures the signal strength on BCCH or, if indicated by a broadcast parameter, on one of the PDCHs in BTTI configuration or on one of the PDCH-pairs in RTTI configuration where the MS receives PACCH. This is particularly useful when BCCH is in a different frequency band than the used PDCHs.

2. **Filtering to Derive the C Value**:
   - The MS measures the signal strength of each radio block it monitors and filters this signal strength using a running average filter to derive the C value. The filtering is typically continuous between RR modes, but it is restarted if there is no valid C value during the previous RR mode.
   - For EC-GSM-IoT, the measurement of the C value is implementation-dependent and based on bursts of the FCCH and EC-SCH channels, excluding contributions from interference and noise.

3. **Measuring Interference Signal Levels**:
   - The MS measures the interference signal level during idle frames of the multiframe when the serving cell is not transmitting. In packet transfer mode, it measures the interference signal strength of all eight channels (slots) on the same carrier as the assigned PDCHs.
   - The interference, denoted as γCH, is filtered using a running average filter, and the filter parameters are broadcast on PBCCH or BCCH.

4. **Reporting Channel Quality**:
   - In packet transfer mode, the MS transfers the 8 γCH values, RXQUAL, SIGN_VAR, and C values to the network in the Channel Quality Report included in the (EGPRS) PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message.
   - For a MS in EC operation, it transfers RXQUAL and C values in the Channel Quality Report included in the EC PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK.
   - In downlink dual carrier and multi-carrier configurations, channel quality measurements are performed for each radio frequency channel or Unique Frequency Parameter Set (UFPS) independently. The MS reports these measurements based on the network's request and the configuration.

5. **Use of PTCCH and Idle Frames**:
   - The MS uses PTCCH and idle frames for BSIC identification for cell re-selection, continuous timing advance procedures, and interference measurements for power control.
   - The scheduling of these tasks is not strictly specified, but the MS must efficiently manage BSIC identification, timing advance, and interference measurements using the available PTCCH and idle frames.

Overall, the MS follows a detailed process to measure signal strength, filter it to derive the C value, measure interference levels, and report channel quality, ensuring efficient communication and network performance in packet transfer mode.","The answer should include:
  - The process of measuring signal strength in packet idle and transfer modes.
  - The filtering method used to derive the C value.
  - How interference signal levels are measured during idle frames.
  - The reporting of channel quality measurements in different configurations (single, dual, multi-carrier).
  - The use of PTCCH and idle frames for BSIC identification, timing advance, and interference measurements."
"What are the conformance requirements for a Base Station (BS) intended to operate in geographic areas with unsynchronised UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD, and for a BS intended to operate co-located with unsynchronised UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD BS?","The manufacturer must declare whether the BS under test is intended to operate in geographic areas where unsynchronised UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD, which includes uplink receive functionality, is deployed.

Additionally, the manufacturer must declare if the BS is intended to operate co-located with unsynchronised UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD BS that includes uplink receive functionality. If so, compliance with the conformance requirement specified in subclause 6.6.3.2.5.2 is mandatory to protect TDD BS receivers in co-located scenarios.

Describe the impact of DSR on throughput and voice quality in various interference scenarios based on 3GPP TS 45.912 specifications.,"The impact of Dual Symbol Rate (DSR) on throughput and voice quality in various interference scenarios is detailed in the 3GPP TS 45.912 specifications. 

Document 1 highlights that DSR can provide 1.7 to 1.9 times higher average throughput in interference-limited scenarios. At the cell border, the throughput gain was observed to be 54% at reuse 3/9. It is suggested that the interference rejection (IR) performance could be improved if dynamic link adaptation were applied in simulations.

Document 2 compares the impact of DSR on voice quality to that of EDGE. At lower data loads, DSR has a similar impact on voice quality as EDGE, but at higher data loads, DSR has a smaller impact than EDGE. Several control measures are proposed to minimize the impact of DSR on voice quality, such as allocating DSR in BCCH carriers and voice users in TCH carriers, synchronizing DSR allocation in BSS, using different frequency reuse patterns, and implementing DSR power control by lowering the power by 2 dB. The findings at the cell border indicate that with similar UL cell throughput as in DL, DSR has a similar impact on voice quality as EDGE, and with 1.7 times higher UL cell throughput, DSR has a 0.7 dB smaller impact on voice quality than EDGE.

Document 3 discusses the use of DSR without specific Radio Resource Management (RRM) optimization, stating that DSR can be used for frequency reuses up to 1/1. IRC receivers can typically handle increased UL interference without decreasing voice capacity, assuming existing networks employ MRC or have sufficient unused gain from IRC. Considerations for edge channels include restricting the use of DSR/EGPRS by punctured MA lists, which will depend on the service. In asynchronous networks, DSR power control can be optimized, and neighboring base stations on the same band with DSR should preferably use interference rejection combining to be more robust against uplink interference from other cells. DSR does not require changes to existing frequency planning and can be enabled like a plug-and-play feature in existing networks.

Overall, DSR improves average throughput significantly in interference-limited scenarios and at cell borders, while its impact on voice quality can be managed effectively through various control measures and optimizations.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The average throughput improvements with DSR in interference limited scenarios and at cell borders.
  - Comparison of DSR's impact on voice quality versus EDGE, especially at different data loads.
  - Control measures to minimize DSR's impact on voice quality, including power control and frequency reuse patterns.
  - The ability of IRC receivers to handle increased UL interference and the implications for existing networks.
  - Considerations for edge channels and asynchronous networks when implementing DSR."
"Describe the burst formats and channel coding schemes used in the GSM-CTS system, highlighting any specific differences from the standard GSM system.","In the GSM-CTS system, three types of burst formats are utilized: Normal Burst (NB), Frequency Correction Burst (FB), and Synchronisation Burst (SB). These burst formats are specified in GSM 05.02 subclause 5.2, with a notable difference for the synchronisation bursts used in GSM-CTS. Specifically, GSM-CTS synchronisation bursts incorporate a unique training sequence to prevent misleading detection by GSM-MS devices.

The Frequency Correction Burst (FB) is employed for the CTSBCH-FB, while the Synchronisation Burst (SB) is used for the CTSBCH-SB. The channel coding scheme for CTSBCH-SB is identical to the one used for SCH, as specified in GSM 05.03 subclause 4.7. Conversely, no channel coding is required for CTSBCH-FB.

Additionally, Synchronisation Bursts (SB) are used for the CTSARCH. Due to the short distance between the CTS-FP and the CTS-MS, there is no need to use a burst of reduced length, such as the Access Burst specified in GSM 05.02 subclause 5.2. The channel coding scheme for CTSARCH is the same as for SCH, as outlined in GSM 05.03 subclause 4.7.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The three types of burst formats used in the GSM-CTS system: Normal Burst (NB), Frequency Correction Burst (FB), and Synchronisation Burst (SB).
  - The specific training sequence used in GSM-CTS synchronisation bursts to avoid misleading detection by GSM-MS.
  - The use of FB for CTSBCH-FB and SB for CTSBCH-SB, including the channel coding schemes: no channel coding for CTSBCH-FB and the same channel coding as SCH for CTSBCH-SB.
  - The use of SB for CTSARCH and the same channel coding scheme as SCH, with a note on the non-requirement of reduced length bursts due to the short distance between CTS-FP and CTS-MS."
"Describe the procedures for restoring PDN connections in the event of an SGW failure as specified in TS 23.007, including the differences in procedures for UEs with ISR active and ISR not active.","The procedures for restoring PDN connections affected by an SGW failure, as specified in TS 23.007, aim to resume the delivery of downlink data towards the UE with minimal service interruption and minimal signaling in the network. These procedures are optional to support and are designed to handle SGW failures with or without restart.

For UEs with ISR (Idle State Signaling Reduction) not active when the SGW fails, the procedures specified in clause 27.2 apply. Conversely, for UEs with ISR active when the SGW fails, the procedures specified in clause 27.3 apply. These procedures are applicable to PDN connections established between MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertaining to the same operator, covering both non-roaming and roaming scenarios with local breakout.

The procedures for an SGW in clauses 27.2 and 27.3 also apply to an SGW-C, which must additionally apply related PFCP procedures towards the SGW-U. The applicability of these procedures is restricted to PDN connections established between MME/S4-SGSN and PGW of the same operator to ensure consistent logic and policies for restoring PDN connections, particularly IMS PDN connections, even in roaming scenarios with local breakout.

While these SGW restoration procedures may be extended by Service Level Agreements to PDN connections established between MME/S4-SGSN and PGW of different operators for roaming scenarios with home routed traffic, this extension is not further considered in 3GPP specifications.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The general purpose of the procedures for restoring PDN connections affected by SGW failure.
  - The distinction between procedures for UEs with ISR active and ISR not active.
  - The scope of applicability of these procedures, including non-roaming and roaming scenarios with local breakout.
  - Mention of the optional nature of these procedures and the potential extension by Service Level Agreements for roaming scenarios with home routed traffic."
"Describe the format and key elements of distribution and non-distribution messages in the 3GPP TS 44.060 specification, including how errors are handled and the significance of the Page Mode and Used DL Coverage Class information.","In the 3GPP TS 44.060 specification, distribution and non-distribution messages are distinguished by the most significant bit of the message type. A distribution message is recognized when this bit is set to '1', while a non-distribution message is recognized when it is set to '0'.

The general format of distribution messages, except those sent on the EC-PACCH, includes the 'Distribution contents' which contain Page Mode information and any specific distribution information according to the message type's syntax. For distribution messages sent on the EC-PACCH, the 'Distribution contents' contain Used DL Coverage Class information instead of Page Mode information. Padding bits in these messages can be reduced to a null string.

Similarly, non-distribution messages have a general format that includes 'Distribution contents' with Page Mode information and specific distribution information. For non-distribution messages sent on the EC-PACCH, the 'Distribution contents' contain Used DL Coverage Class information instead of Page Mode information. Additionally, non-distribution messages include 'Address information' which must be analyzed by the receiving mobile station. Any mobile station not identified by the address information will ignore the 'Non-distribution contents' following the address information. Padding bits in non-distribution messages can also be reduced to a null string.

The Page Mode information, defined in sub-clause 12.20, controls the action of the mobile station belonging to the paging subgroup corresponding to the paging subchannel. The Used DL Coverage Class information, defined in sub-clause 12.71, indicates the DL Coverage Class and the number of blind physical layer transmissions for the current RLC/MAC message.

Errors in these messages are handled using generic error labels for syntactical errors such as 'Unknown message type', 'Distribution part error', 'Address information part error', and 'Non-distribution part error'. When an error is detected, the error branch is called, and the corresponding data is ignored. For 'Unknown message type' errors, the content of the bits representing the message type is ignored, and the remaining part of the message is analyzed according to the 'Default downlink message content' defined in sub-clause 11.2.0.1. This default content includes Page Mode information for messages not sent on the EC-PACCH and Used DL Coverage Class information for messages sent on the EC-PACCH.

The MESSAGE_TYPE field distinguishes different types of downlink RLC/MAC control messages, with specific encoding for Page Mode and Used DL Coverage Class information elements.","The answer should include:
  - The criteria for recognizing distribution and non-distribution messages.
  - The general format of distribution and non-distribution messages, including the specific elements like Page Mode and Used DL Coverage Class information.
  - How padding bits are handled in these messages.
  - The role and encoding of Page Mode and Used DL Coverage Class information.
  - The process for handling syntactical errors, including the generic error labels and the treatment of 'Unknown message type' errors.
  - The default downlink message contents and the significance of the MESSAGE_TYPE field."
"Explain the interleaving process for TCH/F9.6 as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003, including how it is applied across different subclauses.","The interleaving process for TCH/F9.6 as specified in 3GPP TS 45.003 is detailed in subclause 3.3.4. The process involves reordering and interleaving coded bits according to a specific rule: i(B,j) = c(n,k) for k = 0,1,...,455, n = 0,1,...,N,N + 1,..., B = B0 +4n + (k mod 19) + (k div 114), and j = (k mod 19) + 19 (k mod 6). This results in the distribution of the reordered 114 bits of a given data block, n = N, over 19 blocks, with 6 bits equally distributed in each block in a diagonal manner over consecutive blocks. In other words, the interleaving distributes the encoded, reordered 456 bits from four input data blocks over 22 bursts, with 6 bits in the first and 22nd bursts, 12 bits in the second and 21st bursts, 18 bits in the third and 20th bursts, and 24 bits in the remaining 16 bursts. The coded data block is interleaved diagonally, starting a new block of coded data with every fourth burst and distributing it over 22 bursts.

This interleaving process is also referenced in subclauses 3.4.4, 3.5.4, and 3.7.4 of the same document, indicating that the same interleaving method is applied in these contexts as well.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of the interleaving process for TCH/F9.6 as described in subclause 3.3.4. This includes the reordering and interleaving rule, the distribution of coded bits over bursts, and the diagonal interleaving pattern. Additionally, it should mention that the same interleaving process is referenced in subclauses 3.4.4, 3.5.4, and 3.7.4 for other contexts."
"Describe the random access procedure in 3GPP specifications, including the roles of different primitives and synchronization mechanisms.","The random access procedure in 3GPP specifications is a critical process for establishing communication between the User Equipment (UE) and the network. This procedure is invoked whenever a higher layer requests transmission of a message on the Random Access Channel (RACH). The physical random access procedure is controlled by primitives from the Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers.

The sequence begins with the configuration of the RACH via the CPHY-TrCH-Config-REQ primitive, which is used for initial configuration or when a parameter needs to be changed. The CMAC-Config-REQ primitive is then used to configure MAC parameters required for the random access procedure, such as persistence value, Access Service Class (ASC) parameters, and the maximum number of synchronization attempts.

When there is data to be transmitted on the RACH, the MAC-Data-REQ primitive initiates the RACH transmission control procedure, including the selection of an ASC. After a backoff period, the PHY-Access-REQ primitive is sent to the physical layer (L1), triggering the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) message transmission. If no acknowledgment is received on the Fast Physical Access Channel (FPACH) and the maximum number of synchronization attempts has not been exceeded, the PHY-Access-REQ procedure is repeated. Upon acknowledgment of the SYNC_UL burst on the FPACH, the MAC layer receives an acknowledgment via the PHY-Access-CNF primitive, and data transmission is requested with the PHY-DATA-REQ primitive, completing the PRACH transmission procedure.

Node B plays a crucial role in uplink synchronization. If Node B detects that the UE is out of uplink synchronization, it orders the UE to establish synchronization via the High-Speed Shared Control Channel (HS-SCCH) order. The UE then initiates the random access procedure, involving the Uplink Physical Channel (UpPCH) and the Enhanced Uplink Dedicated Channel (E-RUCCH). Node B limits the synchronization delay using a timer T-protect. If the E-RUCCH is not received before T-protect expires, Node B restarts the uplink synchronization procedure via another HS-SCCH order. After N-protect successive attempts, Node B terminates the synchronization procedure and indicates an uplink synchronization failure to higher layers. The specific parameter settings for T-protect and N-protect are configured by higher layers.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The general context of the random access procedure.
  - How the physical random access procedure is invoked and controlled by RRC and MAC primitives.
  - The detailed sequence of random access transmission, including the configuration of RACH, MAC parameters, and the role of different primitives (CPHY-TrCH-Config-REQ, CMAC-Config-REQ, MAC-Data-REQ, PHY-Access-REQ, PHY-Access-CNF, PHY-DATA-REQ).
  - The role of Node B in uplink synchronization, including the use of HS-SCCH orders, the timer T-protect, and handling synchronization failures after N-protect attempts."
Describe the procedures and requirements for routing S-NSSAI and performing local authentication in 3GPP networks.,"The procedures and requirements for routing S-NSSAI and performing local authentication in 3GPP networks are outlined in two key documents: TS 33.326 and TS 33.501.

For routing S-NSSAI, TS 33.326 specifies that if the AAA-P (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Proxy) is present, the NSSAAF (Network Slice Selection Assistance Function) forwards the EAP ID Response message to the AAA-P. If the AAA-P is not present, the NSSAAF forwards the message directly to the AAA-S (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Server). The routing is based on the S-NSSAI (Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information). The requirement is referenced in TS 33.501, clause 6.8.1.2.3, and further detailed in clause 6.13.

To verify the correct routing of NSSAA requests, the test environment should include an AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function), AAA-S, and AAA-P, which may be simulated. The NSSAAF under test should be connected with these components. The test involves preconfiguring the NSSAAF with routing entries for two slices: one directly associated with the MNO (Mobile Network Operator) and the other serving a third party, requiring the use of AAA-P. The execution steps include sending NSSAA authentication requests with different S-NSSAI values and verifying that the NSSAAF forwards the requests to the correct AAA-S or AAA-P. The expected results are that the NSSAAF routes the requests correctly based on the S-NSSAI, with evidence saved in a .pcap file.

For performing local authentication, TS 33.501 describes a procedure used by the gNB (next-generation NodeB) to periodically perform local authentication and check the amount of data sent during the AS (Access Stratum) connection. The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) COUNT check is used to detect maliciously inserted packets. This procedure is triggered when the PDCP COUNT values reach a critical checking value defined by the visited network. The gNB sends a Counter Check message containing the most significant parts of the PDCP COUNT values from each active radio bearer. The UE (User Equipment) responds with a Counter Check Response message, comparing the received PDCP COUNT values with its own. If the response contains different PDCP COUNT values, the gNB may release the connection or report the differences for further traffic analysis to detect potential attackers.

In summary, the NSSAAF routes S-NSSAI based on predefined logic to either AAA-S or AAA-P, and the gNB performs periodic local authentication using PDCP COUNT checks to maintain integrity and detect malicious packets.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how the NSSAAF routes S-NSSAI to the correct AAA-S or AAA-P based on the requirement in TS 33.326.
  - Description of the test environment and pre-conditions for verifying NSSAAF routing.
  - Detailed steps for executing the routing verification test and expected results.
  - Overview of the gNB's periodic local authentication procedure as described in TS 33.501.
  - Importance of PDCP COUNT check in maintaining integrity and detecting malicious packets.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in the interception and delivery of communication content from various gateways (S-GW, PDN-GW, ePDG) to the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) as per the specifications.","The process of interception and delivery of communication content from various gateways (S-GW, PDN-GW, ePDG) to the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) involves several key steps and elements:

1. **Packet Duplication**: At the S-GW, PDN-GW, and ePDG, packets are duplicated without modification. This ensures that the original communication remains intact while a copy is created for interception purposes.

2. **Additional Header Information**: The duplicated packets are sent with additional header information to DF3 for further delivery to the LEA. This header includes crucial details that aid in the identification and correlation of the intercepted data.

3. **Information Transfer**: Along with the intercepted content, the following information needs to be transferred from the gateways to DF3:
   - Target identity
   - Correlation number
   - Timestamp (optional)
   - Direction (indicates whether the packet is Mobile Originated (MO) or Mobile Terminated (MT)) - optional
   - Target location (if available) or Intercept Access Points (IAs) in case of location-dependent interception
   - Date/time of location (if target location is provided)

4. **Packet Detection Rules**: These rules allow the User Plane (UP) function to determine which user plane packets are duplicated and sent to the SX3LIF. The rules may differ for Serving Gateway-U and PDN Gateway-U. For example, Serving Gateway-U may use the GTP tunnel Id of the bearer, while PDN Gateway-U may use the UE IP address.

5. **Forwarding Action Rules**: These rules indicate how the UP function should forward the duplicated packets to the SX3LIF over the X3u reference point. This includes information such as the destination IP address at the SX3LIF and the GTP tunnel Id.

6. **Intercepted Packet Identification Rules**: These rules help the SX3LIF identify and associate the user plane packets received over the X3u reference point with the target intercept information. The SX3LIF uses the IP address and GTP tunnel Id of the X3u tunnel to associate the received packets with the target intercept information received from the Control Plane (CP) function over the X3c reference point.

7. **CC Interception at Serving Gateway**: When CC interception is required at the Serving Gateway, the Serving Gateway-C activates the packet detection rules, forwarding action rules, and indicates to perform packet duplication. It also sends target identity, correlation identifier, and intercepted packet identification rules to the SX3LIF. The Serving Gateway-U forwards the packets to the SX3LIF, which then associates them with the target interception and delivers the communication content to DF3.

8. **CC Interception at PDN Gateway**: Similarly, when CC interception is required at the PDN Gateway, the PDN Gateway-C activates the packet detection rules, forwarding action rules, and indicates to perform packet duplication. It sends target identity, correlation identifier, and intercepted packet identification rules to the SX3LIF. The PDN Gateway-U forwards the packets to the SX3LIF, which associates them with the target interception and delivers the communication content to DF3.

Overall, the process ensures that intercepted communication content is accurately duplicated, identified, and delivered to the LEA with all necessary information for effective monitoring and analysis.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The process of packet duplication at various gateways (S-GW, PDN-GW, ePDG) without modification.
  - The additional header information required for delivery to DF3.
  - The specific information that needs to be transferred (target identity, correlation number, timestamp, direction, target location, date/time of location).
  - The packet detection rules for UP function and differences between Serving Gateway-U and PDN Gateway-U.

"Describe the procedures and information elements involved in Local Call Local Switching (LCLS) call leg correlation within a GERAN network, including the roles of the originating MSC server, terminating MSC server, and BSS.","Local Call Local Switching (LCLS) call leg correlation within a GERAN network involves several key procedures and information elements. The originating MSC server generates a Global Call Reference (GCR) Information Element, which serves as a globally unique call identifier for the duration of the call. This GCR IE is included in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST and HANDOVER REQUEST messages sent to all nodes in the routing path. The BSS, upon receiving the GCR IE, stores it for each call leg until the call is released or handed over to another BSS. If the BSS supports LCLS, it performs call leg correlation and sends the LCLS-BSS-Status IE with the correct value in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE or HANDOVER COMPLETE messages.

The tMSC server, when performing access bearer assignment, includes the GCR IE and the LCLS-Configuration IE in the BSSAP Assignment Request message sent to the terminating BSS. If the tMSC server supports optional intra-Network call detection and determines that the Network ID within the GCR IE is not equal to its own Network ID, it includes the LCLS-Correlation-Not-Needed IE in the Assignment Request message. Similarly, if the tMSC server supports optional intra-BSS call detection and determines that the BSS ID within the GCR IE is not equal to the terminating BSS ID, it includes the LCLS-Correlation-Not-Needed IE in the Assignment Request message.

The terminating BSS, upon receiving the Assignment Request message containing the GCR IE and the LCLS-Configuration IE, stores the GCR against the assigned call leg and checks if it can support the requested LCLS-Configuration. If the BSS does not support LCLS, the GCR IE and LCLS-Configuration IE are ignored, and no LCLS-BSS-Status IE is returned in the Assignment Complete message. The tMSC server then continues the call establishment as for a normal non-LCLS call.

For detailed descriptions and related call flows for the call establishment procedures, refer to Clause 6. The handling of supplementary service interaction with LCLS and Inter-MSC Handover is further detailed in Clauses 13 and 8, respectively.","The answer should cover the generation and role of the Global Call Reference (GCR) Information Element, its inclusion in specific messages by the originating MSC server, and the handling of these messages by the BSS. It should explain the conditions under which the BSS performs call leg correlation and the significance of the LCLS-BSS-Status IE. Additionally, the answer should detail the procedures for the tMSC server when performing access bearer assignment, including the handling of optional Intra-Network and Intra-BSS Call Detection procedures. References to specific clauses for further details should be included."

Explain the differences between the TCI State Indication and the Enhanced TCI States Indication for UE-specific PDCCH MAC CE as specified in 3GPP TS 38.321.,"The TCI State Indication and the Enhanced TCI States Indication for UE-specific PDCCH MAC CE are mechanisms used by the network to indicate TCI states for PDCCH reception in a Serving Cell or a set of Serving Cells. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Purpose and Usage Conditions**:
   - **TCI State Indication**: This is used to indicate a single TCI state for PDCCH reception. It is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID and has a fixed size of 16 bits.
   - **Enhanced TCI States Indication**: This is used to indicate two TCI states for PDCCH reception. It is identified by a MAC PDU subheader with eLCID and has a fixed size of 24 bits.

2. **Fields and Their Lengths**:
   - **Serving Cell ID**:
     - Both indications have a Serving Cell ID field with a length of 5 bits, indicating the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies.
   - **CORESET ID**:
     - Both indications have a CORESET ID field with a length of 4 bits, indicating the Control Resource Set for which the TCI state is being indicated. If the value is 0, it refers to the Control Resource Set configured by controlResourceSetZero.
   - **TCI State ID**:
     - **TCI State Indication**: This field has a length of 7 bits and indicates a single TCI state identified by TCI-StateId.
     - **Enhanced TCI States Indication**: This field also has a length of 7 bits but indicates two TCI states identified by TCI-StateId.

3. **Field Values and Implications**:
   - For both indications, if the CORESET ID field is set to a value other than 0, the TCI state ID field indicates a TCI-StateId configured by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID.
   - For the TCI State Indication, if the CORESET ID field is set to 0, the TCI state ID field indicates a TCI-StateId for a TCI state of the first 64 TCI-states configured by tci-StatesToAddModList and tci-StatesToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or by dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToAddModList and dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or the reference BWP.

4. **Specific Notes and Conditions for Enhanced TCI States Indication**:
   - The Enhanced TCI States Indication is not applicable to any of the configured CORESETs in a BWP if the CORESETs are configured with different CORESETPoolindex values in the BWP.
   - It is applied only if sfnSchemePdcch is configured.
   - It is not applicable to the CORESET configured by controlResourceSetZero if the CORESET is associated with the search space configured by pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB, or searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, or pagingSearchSpace in PDCCH-ConfigCommon.

In summary, while both indications serve to inform the UE about TCI states for PDCCH reception, the Enhanced TCI States Indication provides more detailed information by indicating two TCI states and has additional conditions for its applicability.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The purpose and usage conditions of both TCI State Indication and Enhanced TCI States Indication.
  - The specific fields and their lengths for both indications, including Serving Cell ID, CORESET ID, and TCI state ID.
  - The differences in the field values and their implications, particularly for CORESET ID and TCI state ID.
  - Any specific notes or conditions that apply to the Enhanced TCI States Indication, such as its applicability to certain CORESETs and the requirement for sfnSchemePdcch configuration."
"Describe the different approaches for provisioning a new target in the LI system as outlined in TS 33.127, and discuss the potential risks and benefits associated with each approach.","In TS 33.127, two main approaches for provisioning a new target in the Lawful Interception (LI) system are outlined. 

The first approach involves deploying the full target list at all Points of Interception (POIs) during the User Equipment (UE) registration process. This method is straightforward and ensures that every POI is fully armed and ready to recognize if a target identifier is in the target list as soon as the UE arrives in the network. The primary benefit of this approach is its simplicity and immediate readiness for interception. However, it carries a significant risk: if any node is compromised, the entire target list could be leaked, posing a substantial security threat.

The second approach is more selective and involves polling every serving User Data Management (UDM) POI for all target UEs. The Administration and Management Function (ADMF) will arm the associated POI and start interception only if a target UE is discovered to be served by that particular Network Function (NF). This method takes longer to implement and is likely to miss more ongoing target interactions with the network compared to the first approach. However, it reduces the risk of compromising the entire target list, as only the relevant POIs are armed based on the presence of target UEs.

Both approaches have their own set of risks and benefits. The first approach is faster and simpler but riskier in terms of security, while the second approach is more secure but slower and potentially less effective in real-time interception.","The answer should cover the two main approaches for provisioning a new target in the LI system: 1) deploying the full target list at all POIs, and 2) polling every serving UDM POI for target UEs. It should discuss the simplicity and risk of the first approach, including the potential for compromising the complete target list. For the second approach, it should explain the longer time required and the likelihood of missing ongoing target interactions, as well as the race condition consequences faced by the CSP."
"Describe the inter-frequency measurement reporting process in UTRAN, including the quantities reported by the UE and the criteria for triggering measurement reports.","The inter-frequency measurement reporting process in UTRAN involves the UE reporting specific quantities for each cell when an event is triggered for an inter-frequency measurement. The quantities that the UE shall report are defined by the 'Inter-frequency reporting quantity' Information Element (IE) and include the following:

1. Cell identity
2. SFN-SFN observed time difference
3. Cell synchronization information
4. Downlink Ec/No (FDD)
5. Downlink path loss
6. Downlink received signal code power (RSCP) after despreading
7. ISCP measured on Timeslot basis (TDD)
8. Proposed TGSN (TDD)
9. UTRA carrier RSSI

For FDD mode, path loss is calculated as the difference between the Primary CPICH Tx power and CPICH RSCP, both measured in dBm. For TDD mode, path loss is calculated as the difference between the Primary CCPCH Tx power and Primary CCPCH RSCP, also measured in dBm. Path loss values are rounded up to the next higher integer, with results higher than 158 reported as 158 and results lower than 46 reported as 46.

The criteria for triggering measurement reports are specified within the measurement reporting criteria field in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message. UTRAN notifies the UE which events should trigger the UE to send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message. These events are evaluated with respect to one of the measurement quantities and are measured on the monitored primary common pilot channels (CPICH) in FDD mode and the monitored primary common control channels (PCCPCH) in TDD mode.

Used and non-used frequencies are defined based on whether the frequency is currently used for the connection or not. The frequency of the first secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is treated as a non-used frequency for inter-frequency measurement purposes and as a used frequency for intra-frequency measurement purposes when more than one uplink frequency is configured.

The monitored set on non-used frequency consists of cells in the IE 'Intra-frequency cell info on secondary UL frequency' or 'Inter-frequency cell info' in the variable CELL_INFO_LIST that are not part of the virtual active set on that non-used frequency. The detected set on non-used frequency includes all cells not part of the virtual active set and not in the CELL_INFO_LIST. The IE 'Cells to be excluded in non-used frequency detected cells' instructs the UE to exclude certain cells from the measurement report.

For measurements configured with the IE 'Triggering Condition non-used frequency detected cells,' the UE maintains two virtual active sets and two variables to evaluate the event using one set and variable for cells only in the CELL_INFO_LIST and another set and variable for all cells, including detected set cells not indicated in 'Cells to be excluded in non-used frequency detected cells.'","Key details the answer must include:
  - List and describe the inter-frequency reporting quantities (1 to 9) as specified in TS 25.331 14.2.0
  - Explain the pathloss calculation for both FDD and TDD modes, including the units and reporting limits
  - Outline the measurement reporting criteria and events that trigger the MEASUREMENT REPORT message as per TS 25.331 14.2.1
  - Define used and non-used frequencies and their handling in inter-frequency measurements
  - Describe the monitored and detected sets on non-used frequency and the exclusion of certain cells from measurement reports
  - Explain the concept of virtual active sets and variables for event evaluation"
"Describe the procedures and signaling flows involved in the cancellation of PS handover in GERAN A/Gb mode and UTRAN/GERAN Iu mode, including the conditions under which the handover can be canceled and the subsequent steps taken by the source BSS and SGSN.","The PS handover can be canceled by the source BSS under several conditions, such as timer expiration or loss of radio contact with the mobile station (MS). The cancellation process involves sending a PS Handover Cancel PDU to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) to release the resources reserved for the handover in the target system.

Before the PS Handover Command message is sent to the MS, the source BSS can cancel the handover due to various events within the source BSS. The signaling procedures for this scenario are detailed in sub-clause 5.5.2.

After the PS Handover Command message is sent, if the source BSS detects that radio contact with the MS has been lost, it initiates the PS Handover Cancel procedure. In the case of an optimized intra-BSS PS handover, the BSS releases the assigned resources in both the source and target cells. For SGSN-involved PS handovers, the source BSS releases the resources in the source cell and sends a PS Handover Cancel PDU to the old SGSN to release the reserved resources in the target cell.

In GERAN A/Gb mode, the source BSS sends a PS Handover Cancel PDU to the old SGSN, which then terminates the PS handover by sending a Relocation Cancel Request message to the new SGSN. The new SGSN triggers the release of resources in the target cell and returns a Relocation Cancel Response message to the old SGSN, which then releases all its resources for the connection.

In UTRAN/GERAN Iu mode, the source BSS sends a PS Handover Cancel PDU to the old SGSN, which terminates the PS handover by sending a Relocation Cancel Request message to the new SGSN. The new SGSN sends an Iu Release Command message to the target Radio Network Controller (RNC), which releases all resources allocated for the handover and returns an Iu Release Complete message to the new SGSN. The new SGSN then releases its own resources and returns a Relocation Cancel Response message to the old SGSN.

Detailed signaling flows for these procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.401.","The answer should include:
- The conditions under which the PS handover can be canceled by the source BSS, such as timer expiration and loss of radio contact with the MS.
- The procedure for sending PS Handover Cancel PDU to the SGSN.
- The signaling procedures before and after the PS Handover Command message is sent.
- The steps taken by the source BSS and SGSN in both GERAN A/Gb mode and UTRAN/GERAN Iu mode, including the release of resources and the exchange of Relocation Cancel Request and Response messages.

Describe the roles and functions of the key functional entities within the SIP core as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280.,"The SIP core, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280, is responsible for providing rendezvous (contact address binding and URI resolution) and service control (application service selection) functions. It is composed of three key functional entities: the local inbound/outbound proxy, the registrar finder, and the registrar/application service selection entity.

1. **Local Inbound/Outbound Proxy Functional Entity**: This entity acts as both an inbound proxy and an outbound proxy for all SIP transactions. It provides several functions including:
   - NAT traversal
   - Resource control
   - Routing and forwarding requests and responses to user agents
   - SIP signalling security
   - Discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers, depending on the PLMN operator policy

2. **Registrar Finder Functional Entity**: The registrar finder is responsible for identifying the serving registrar/application service selection functional entity. It uses information from either the PLMN operator's SIP database or the MC service provider's SIP database, and optionally the PLMN operator's internal information such as network topology and registrar availability. The registrar finder can operate in different domains:
   - In the MC service provider domain, it uses the MC service provider's SIP database to identify the serving registrar.
   - In the PLMN operator domain, it uses the PLMN operator's SIP database to identify the serving registrar.
   - In scenarios where the registrar finder is in the PLMN operator domain and the registrar is in the MC service provider domain, it uses the MC service provider's SIP database for identification.
   Additionally, the registrar finder provides discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.

3. **Registrar/Application Service Selection Functional Entity**: This entity performs several critical functions:
   - Acts as a registrar with an integral provision of a location server, and also serves as an inbound and outbound proxy for SIP transactions requiring application service selection.
   - Registers users and maintains the association of their location and identity in a location service, providing notifications of registration states.
   - Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling, accessing either the public network's SIP database or the MC service provider's SIP database.
   - Provides application service selection for all SIP transactions, potentially based on information stored in the public network's SIP database or the MC service provider's SIP database.
   - Performs SIP signalling security.

Overall, the SIP core integrates these functional entities to ensure efficient contact address binding, URI resolution, and service control within the network.","The answer should cover the specific roles and functions of each functional entity within the SIP core as described in the documents. It should include the local inbound/outbound proxy's capabilities such as NAT traversal and SIP signalling security, the registrar finder's role in identifying serving registrars and providing discovery/address resolution, and the registrar/application service selection entity's functions including user registration, authentication, and application service selection.

Explain the handling of criticality information in RNSAP messages according to 3GPP TS 25.423 specifications.,"The handling of criticality information in RNSAP messages according to 3GPP TS 25.423 specifications involves several key aspects. Criticality information is set for individual Information Elements (IEs) and/or IE groups within RNSAP messages, instructing the receiver on how to act when an IE or IE group is not comprehended. The criticality information is crucial in cases of missing IE/IE group abstract syntax errors.

There are three possible values for criticality information:
1. Reject IE: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE', the receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information received is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the procedure is terminated, and the Error Indication procedure is initiated.
2. Ignore IE and Notify Sender: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present. The missing IEs/IE groups are reported in the response message, and if necessary, the Error Indication procedure is initiated.
3. Ignore IE: If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Ignore IE', the receiving node shall ignore the missing IEs and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present.

The rules for comprehension of IEs, IE groups, and EPs are as follows:
1. IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity, although some may remain unsupported.
2. EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality 'Reject IE' or 'Ignore IE and Notify Sender', the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. Additional elements such as the Repetition Number IE and the Message Structure IE (if the missing IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1) are also included.

In summary, the handling of criticality information in RNSAP messages ensures that the receiving node takes appropriate actions based on the specified criticality of missing IEs/IE groups, thereby maintaining the integrity and functionality of the communication procedures.","The answer should include:
  - The role of criticality information in RNSAP messages.
  - The three possible values of criticality information and their implications.

"Describe the service operations involved in PC5 security establishment for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay communication over Control Plane, including the procedures and expected responses.","The PC5 security establishment for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay communication over Control Plane involves two key service operations: the Register service operation and the ResolveRemoteUserId service operation.

The Register service operation is invoked by a Network Function (NF) Service Consumer, specifically the Authentication Server Function (AUSF), to request the Proximity-based Services Network Function (PAnF) to store the ProSe context information for a 5G ProSe Remote User Equipment (UE). This operation is crucial for establishing security over the Control Plane. The procedure involves the AUSF sending a POST request to the resource representing the ProSe Context Info for a 5G ProSe Remote UE. If the operation is successful, the PAnF responds with a '204 No Content' status code. If the user does not exist, a '404 Not Found' status code is returned, including additional error information in the response body within the 'ProblemDetails' element. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with relevant error information in the POST response body.

The ResolveRemoteUserId service operation is invoked by another NF Service Consumer, the Session Management Function (SMF), towards the PAnF to resolve the Remote User ID. This operation is also part of the PC5 security establishment process. The SMF sends a POST request to the resource representing the 'get' custom operation, with the request body containing the Remote User ID (CP-PRUK ID). On success, a '200 OK' status code is returned, and the response body contains the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI). On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with additional error information.

These operations ensure that the necessary context information is stored and resolved, facilitating secure communication over the Control Plane for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay communication.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of NF Service Consumers (AUSF and SMF) in invoking the respective service operations.

"Describe the process and requirements for an MSC server to support early-session as a network option, including the necessary steps and interactions with other protocols and systems.","To support early-session as a network option, the MSC server must follow a specific process and meet certain requirements. Firstly, when the MSC server receives an incoming SETUP message, it must include the 'early-session' option tag in the Supported header field of the SIP INVITE request, as defined in IETF RFC 3959. This step is crucial for indicating that the MSC server supports early-session.

Upon receiving the first SIP 18x response that includes an early-session SDP, the MSC server is required to send an ALERTING message. This message is sent according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.008. Following this, the MSC server must engage in a negotiation process for early-session and normal session establishment with the IMS side. This negotiation follows the procedure outlined for the MGCF in 3GPP TS 29.163 clause 7.5.13.

In summary, the key steps for the MSC server to support early-session include:
1. Including the 'early-session' option tag in the Supported header field of the SIP INVITE request.
2. Sending an ALERTING message upon receiving the first SIP 18x response with early-session SDP.

Each IRP instance's capabilities are fully identified by the version number of the corresponding IRP specification, referred to as the IRPVersion. The IRPAgent must provide a function that allows the IRPManager to retrieve all supported IRPVersions over the Itf-N interface. This enables the IRPManager to decide whether it wants to communicate with the IRP instance based on the retrieved IRPVersions.

Additionally, the CORBA Solution Set is described in Annex A of TS 32.316. This annex provides the CORBA Solution Set for the IRP, whose semantics are specified in the Generic IRP: Information Service (TS 32.312). The CORBA Solution Set outlines the implementation details and protocols for communication between IRPManager and IRPAgent, ensuring that the semantics defined in TS 32.312 are adhered to.","The answer should include a detailed explanation of the IRPAgent's role, its ability to support multiple IRP instances, how the capabilities of each instance are identified, and the function allowing IRPManager to retrieve supported IRP versions. Additionally, it should describe the CORBA Solution Set and its relation to the semantics specified in TS 32.312."
Describe the performance requirements and applicability rules for PUSCH and UCI multiplexed on PUSCH for IAB-DU as defined in 3GPP TS 38.176.,"The performance requirements for PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel) are determined by a minimum required throughput for a given Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This required throughput is expressed as a fraction of the maximum throughput for the Fixed Reference Configurations (FRCs) listed in annex A, and the performance requirements assume Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) re-transmissions. The specific tests applicable to IAB-DU (Integrated Access and Backhaul - Distributed Unit) are based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.

The applicability rules for PUSCH requirement tests cover various aspects:

1. **Subcarrier Spacings**: PUSCH requirement tests apply only for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported. If IAB-DU supports more than one subcarrier spacing, tests with the highest modulation order apply only with the lowest supported subcarrier spacing, and tests with other modulation orders apply only with the highest supported subcarrier spacing.

2. **Channel Bandwidths**: For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth apply only if the IAB-DU supports it. Tests are done only for the widest supported channel bandwidth, or if not specified, for the closest lower channel bandwidth.

3. **Configurations**: PUSCH requirement tests apply only for the mapping type declared to be supported. If both mapping types A and B are supported, tests are done for either type A or B, with the same chosen mapping type used for all tests except for PUSCH mapping Type B with 2 symbol length allocated.

4. **Uplink Carrier Aggregation**: Tests for uplink carrier aggregation are carried out according to the declaration and apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled, conducted on a per component carrier basis.

5. **TDD UL-DL Patterns**: For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, if IAB-DU supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of the supported patterns is used for all tests.

6. **Transform Precoding**: Tests with transform precoding enabled apply only if the IAB-DU supports it.

For UCI (Uplink Control Information) multiplexed on PUSCH, the performance requirement is determined by two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI (Channel State Information) part 1 and CSI part 2. The required SNR is measured at a BLER of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1%, and CSI part 2 not exceeding 1%. The UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two cases: 7 bits (5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2) and 40 bits (20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2). In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1, and CSI part 2 are transmitted simultaneously. The specific tests applicable to IAB-DU are based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.","The answer must include the performance requirements for PUSCH, including the minimum required throughput for a given SNR and the assumption of HARQ re-transmissions. It should detail the applicability rules for PUSCH requirement tests across different subcarrier spacings, channel bandwidths, configurations, uplink carrier aggregation, TDD UL-DL patterns, and transform precoding. Additionally, the answer should cover the performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, including the BLER thresholds for CSI part 1 and CSI part 2, the definition of UCI information bit payload per slot, and the simultaneous transmission of PUSCH data, CSI part 1, and CSI part 2. The test applicability rules for IAB-DU as defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2 should be referenced throughout."
Describe the testing requirements for repeaters with optional components according to 3GPP TS 38.115.,"According to 3GPP TS 38.115, testing requirements for repeaters with optional components, such as a duplexer or an ancillary RF amplifier, are specified to ensure compliance with the standard. 

For repeaters with a duplexer, if the duplexer is supplied as part of the repeater, all requirements must be met with the duplexer fitted. If the duplexer is optional, tests should be conducted both with and without the duplexer to verify compliance. The specific tests that must be performed with and without the duplexer include:
1) Repeater output power (clause 6.2) for the highest static power step, if measured at the antenna connector.
2) Out of band gain (clause 6.4) outside the repeater downlink or uplink band.
3) Unwanted emissions (clause 6.5) outside the repeater downlink or uplink band.
4) Output intermodulation (clause 6.7), ensuring carrier frequencies minimize intermodulation products falling in receive channels.
5) Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (clause 6.9) outside the repeater downlink or uplink band.

Other tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted. It is important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test apparatus when performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted. This can be achieved using attenuators, isolators, and filters. Additionally, intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP specifications and may degrade over time. Therefore, operators should select NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive channels.

For repeaters with an ancillary RF amplifier, the requirements must be met with the amplifier fitted. During tests, the amplifier is connected to the repeater by a connecting network with applicable loss to ensure appropriate operating conditions. The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values, with the lowest value used unless otherwise stated. Tests should be repeated with and without the ancillary amplifier to verify compliance. Specifically, the repeater output power test (clause 6.2) must be conducted with the highest applicable attenuation value applied.

In summary, the testing requirements for repeaters with optional components according to 3GPP TS 38.115 involve conducting specific tests with and without the components to ensure compliance, considering intermodulation products, and selecting appropriate NR-ARFCNs to minimize interference.","The answer should cover the necessity of performing tests with and without optional components (duplexer and ancillary RF amplifier) to ensure compliance with 3GPP TS 38.115. It should detail the specific tests required (repeater output power, out of band gain, unwanted emissions, output intermodulation, Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio) and the considerations for intermodulation products and connecting network loss. Additionally, it should mention the importance of selecting NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive channels."
Describe the procedure for ASP to consume provisioning MnS to instantiate the EAS as depicted in Figure 7.1.2.1-1 of TS 28.538.,"The procedure for ASP to consume provisioning MnS to instantiate the EAS involves several steps. Firstly, the ASP consumes the provisioning MnS with the createMOI operation for the EASRequirements IOC, which includes deployment requirements such as service areas, software image information, QoS requirements, service continuity requirements, and affinity/anti-affinity requirements. The ECSP provisioning MnS producer then sends a response to the ASP indicating that the instantiation operation is in progress.

Next, the ECSP provisioning MnS producer analyzes the deployment requirements to determine the appropriate EDN and the number of EAS instances needed. It downloads the EAS VNF software image from the specified location. The ECSP provisioning MnS producer then invokes the InstantiateNsRequest or UpdateNsRequest operation to request the NFVO to instantiate a NS instance, including the EAS VNF instance.

The NFVO sends a notification to the ECSP provisioning MnS producer indicating the result of the instantiation procedure. If the VNF instantiation is successful, the ECSP provisioning MnS producer creates the MOI for the EASFunction IOC. If all VNF instances are successfully instantiated, the ECSP provisioning MnS producer creates the MOI for the EASRequirements IOC and notifies the ASP about the successful instantiation of the EAS. If the instantiation is unsuccessful, the ECSP provisioning MnS producer notifies the ASP about the failure.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
1. ASP's consumption of provisioning MnS with createMOI operation for EASRequirements IOC.
2. Attributes included in EASRequirements IOC (service areas, software image information, QoS requirements, service continuity requirements, affinity/anti-affinity).
3. ECSP provisioning MnS producer's response and analysis of deployment requirements.
4. Invocation of InstantiateNsRequest or UpdateNsRequest operation by ECSP provisioning MnS producer to request NFVO to instantiate NS instance.
5. Notification from NFVO to ECSP provisioning MnS producer about the result of instantiation procedure.
6. Creation of MOI for EASFunction IOC and EASRequirements IOC by ECSP provisioning MnS producer.
7. Notification to ASP about the successful or unsuccessful instantiation of EAS."
"Describe the process and requirements for transmitting RLC data blocks in both uplink and downlink directions, including the role of USF and pseudorandom data sequences, as specified in 3GPP TS 44.014.","The process and requirements for transmitting RLC data blocks in both uplink and downlink directions, as specified in 3GPP TS 44.014, involve several key elements:

1. **Role of USF in Downlink Transmission**: The SS sets the USF (Uplink State Flag) field in blocks transmitted on the downlink to address the MS (Mobile Station). The MS shall transmit RLC (Radio Link Control) data blocks obeying USF, according to the normal rules for transmission. This ensures that the MS knows when it is allowed to send data.

2. **Exception for MS with EC Operation**: In cases where an MS has enabled EC (Extended Coverage) operation, the MS is not allocated resources by USF. Instead, the SS allocates resources through Fixed Uplink Allocation. The MS shall then transmit RLC data blocks obeying the Fixed Uplink Allocation(s).

3. **Pseudorandom Data Sequences**: The data payload of the RLC data blocks in the uplink shall contain a pseudorandom data sequence. This sequence is generated using any binary pseudorandom sequence generator with a cycle of 32,767 bits or greater, such as those defined by CCITT (e.g., PN15, PN22). Example test patterns can be found in CCITT recommendation O.153.

4. **Valid MAC and RLC Headers**: Both uplink and downlink RLC data blocks must have valid MAC (Medium Access Control) headers and may have valid RLC headers. These headers are essential for proper data transmission and processing by Layer 1.

5. **Multiple Transmit Timeslots**: When multiple transmit timeslots are active, the same data carried in the RLC data block in the first timeslot may be used in RLC data blocks carried in subsequent timeslots. This helps in efficient use of resources and simplifies the transmission process.

6. **Handling CRC Errors**: In the event where the USF field is correctly decoded but there is a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) error on the payload data, the MS shall, if required by the USF, transmit the received payload data. This ensures that data transmission continues even in the presence of errors.

7. **Countdown Procedure**: The countdown procedure (CV=15) shall not be used for uplink RLC data blocks. This is a specific requirement to ensure proper timing and synchronization in data transmission.

8. **Repetition of Pseudorandom Sequences**: When RLC/MAC control blocks are received on the downlink, the MS may repeat on the uplink the pseudorandom sequence carried in the previous uplink RLC data blocks. This helps in maintaining consistency in data patterns.

Overall, these requirements ensure reliable and efficient transmission of RLC data blocks in both uplink and downlink directions, with specific handling for different scenarios and error conditions.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The role of USF in addressing the MS for downlink transmission and the normal rules for MS transmission of RLC data blocks.
  - The exception for MS with EC operation and the use of Fixed Uplink Allocation.
  - The requirement for pseudorandom data sequences in the data payload of RLC data blocks and the specifications for generating these sequences.
  - The handling of valid MAC and RLC headers in both uplink and downlink transmissions.
  - The process for multiple transmit timeslots and the use of the same data in subsequent timeslots.
  - The specific handling of CRC errors and the countdown procedure for uplink RLC data blocks.
  - The repetition of pseudorandom sequences in uplink transmissions when RLC/MAC control blocks are received on the downlink."
"Describe the process and conditions under which a UE can push a session to another federated UE, including the role of the AS in handling the REFER request.","The process for a User Equipment (UE) to push a session to another federated UE involves several steps and conditions. Firstly, the UE must learn the status and identities of other federated UEs using the dialog event package specified in RFC 4235 and extended as specified in TS 24.229. Once the UE has this information, it sends a REFER request towards the target UE. The REFER request is populated with specific details: the Request-URI is set to the UE's own public user identity and includes a 'gr' SIP URI parameter, which is set to the value of the 'identity' attribute for the target UE received in the dialog event notification. This 'identity' attribute has the same format as a Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) but is not assigned by the Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) and only has local significance. Additionally, the Refer-to header field is set to the SIP URI of the remote end, including headers and bodies determined by the service logic.

The Application Server (AS) plays a crucial role in handling the REFER request. Upon receiving the REFER request, the AS must verify that the user is allowed to push a call. If the call push is allowed based on local policy, the AS can either forward the REFER request towards the REFER target or start Third Party Call Control (3pcc) procedures to transfer the originating leg from the originator of the REFER request to the REFER target and, if necessary, update the terminating leg. The AS uses the 'gr' SIP URI parameter in the Request-URI to identify the REFER target UE. If the AS knows that the 'gr' SIP URI parameter is not a GRUU assigned by the S-CSCF, it must remove the 'gr' SIP URI parameter from the Request-URI before forwarding the request.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
1. The steps a UE must take to push a session to another federated UE, including learning the status and identities of other UEs and sending a REFER request.
2. How the Request-URI is set and the significance of the 'gr' SIP URI parameter.
3. The role of the AS in verifying user permissions for call push.
4. The actions the AS can take if the call push is allowed, including forwarding the REFER request or starting 3pcc procedures.

"Describe the requirements and conditions for measuring the serving cell absolute accuracy of RSRP as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521, including the reference sensitivity power level and the measurement report mapping.","The serving cell absolute accuracy of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) is defined as the RSRP measured from the serving cell. The accuracy requirements are valid under specific conditions: cell-specific reference signals must be transmitted from one, two, or four antenna ports, and the conditions defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 Clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity must be fulfilled. The RSRP reporting range is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with a resolution of 1 dB. The mapping of the measured quantity is detailed in Table 9.9.2.1.3-2, and the range in the signaling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range. The normative references for these requirements are found in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.1, clause 9.1.4, and A.9.9.2.

The reference sensitivity power level (REFSENS) is the minimum mean power applied to each UE antenna port for all UE categories except category 0, category M1, category M2, and category 1bis, or to the single antenna port for UE category 0, UE category M1, category M2, and UE category 1bis. At this power level, the throughput must meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. The throughput for the REFSENS test is measured based on Transmission Mode 1 unless specified otherwise.","The answer must include the definition of serving cell absolute accuracy of RSRP, the conditions under which the accuracy requirements are valid, the transmission from antenna ports, the reference sensitivity conditions, the RSRP reporting range and resolution, the measurement report mapping, and the normative references.

Describe the procedures and requirements for confidentiality protection in MCData services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 and TS 33.180.,"Confidentiality protection in MCData services is governed by specific conditions and procedures outlined in 3GPP TS 24.282 and TS 33.180. 

According to 3GPP TS 24.282 clause 6.5.2.3.1, confidentiality protection is enabled if the <confidentiality-protection> element in the MCData Service Configuration document is set to 'true' or if the element is absent. When enabled, the MCData client must use the appropriate keying information specified in clause 6.5.2.2, perform procedures to protect XML elements containing content described in clause 4.6, and protect URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in clause 4.6. If the <confidentiality-protection> element is set to 'false', confidentiality protection is disabled, and content is included in XML elements and attributes without encryption.

When confidentiality protection is enabled, as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.1, and the participating MCData function receives a Client Server Key (CSK) within a SIP REGISTER or SIP PUBLISH request for service authorization, the MCData function may update the CSK. The procedure involves generating a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 and IETF RFC 3428, setting the Request-URI to the URI received in the To header field of the third-party SIP REGISTER request, including specific header fields such as Accept-Contact and P-Asserted-Service, and including an application/mikey MIME body containing the algorithm, CSK-ID, and encrypted CSK within a MIKEY message. The SIP MESSAGE request is then sent to the MCData client.

Additionally, 3GPP TS 33.180 clause 9.2.1 specifies the algorithm and keying information used to protect MCData signalling fields. This includes details on how the CSK is encrypted and the procedures for key download.

"Describe the handling of failures between MSC-B server and MGW-B as per 3GPP TS 23.205, including the release of resources and call termination procedures.","In the context of 3GPP TS 23.205, the handling of failures between the MSC-B server and MGW-B involves several key steps and procedures. Firstly, it is important to understand that the terms 'incoming' and 'outgoing' refer to the direction of propagation of the Release message, not the direction of establishing the original call.

When a procedure between the MSC-B server and MGW-B fails, the MSC-B server must handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 and 3GPP TS 29.010. This means that the MSC-B server will treat the failure as an internal issue and follow the guidelines provided in these specifications to manage the error.

If MGW-B resources have already been seized at the target access side, these resources must be released using the Release Termination procedure. This ensures that any resources allocated for the failed procedure are properly freed and made available for other operations.

Additionally, the call from the MSC-A server must be released as described in clause 7.1 of 3GPP TS 23.205. This involves following the specific steps outlined in the clause to terminate the call and ensure that all related resources are appropriately managed.

How are Abstract Syntax Errors in NGAP messages handled according to the 3GPP TS 38.413 specification?,"Abstract Syntax Errors in NGAP messages are handled according to specific rules outlined in the 3GPP TS 38.413 specification. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NGAP messages, including the ordering and occurrence rules for Information Elements (IEs). If an NGAP message is not constructed according to these rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error.

An Abstract Syntax Error occurs in several cases:
1. When the receiving entity receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID).
2. When IEs violate the logical range specified.
3. When mandatory IEs or IE groups are missing.
4. When IEs or IE groups are in the wrong order or have too many occurrences.
5. When conditional IEs or IE groups are present but the condition is not met.
6. When IEs or IE groups are received for unsupported functionality.

The handling of Abstract Syntax Errors depends on the type of error:
- For cases 1, 2, and 6, the receiver acts according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information of the IE/IE group.
- For case 3, the receiver also considers the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the missing IE/IE group.
- For cases 4 and 5, the procedure is rejected, and the handling is specified in subclause 10.3.6.

If a message initiating a procedure contains IEs or IE groups in the wrong order or with too many occurrences, the receiving node rejects the procedure and reports the cause value ","The answer must include the rules for constructing NGAP messages as per ASN.1 definitions, the specific conditions that constitute an Abstract Syntax Error, and the detailed procedures for handling such errors, including rejection of procedures, initiation of error indication, and local error handling.

The format of the Old Serial Number IE is defined in subclause 9.2.3. Similarly, the New Serial Number IE is used to identify a new message intended for broadcast. This identifier is also altered every time the message changes, ensuring that new messages can be distinguished from old ones. The format for the New Serial Number IE is likewise defined in subclause 9.2.3.

This process is essential for authenticating a user equipment (UE) in a 5G network.

The UDM initiates the process by sending a POST request with the custom method 'generate-av' to the HSS. The request must include the following parameters:
- The identity of the UE (imsi).
- The serving network name.
- The authentication method (either 5G_AKA or EAP_AKA_PRIME).
- Optional resynchronization information if needed.

Upon receiving the request, the HSS processes it and responds accordingly:
- If the request is successful, the HSS returns a '200 OK' status code along with the authentication vector in the message body.
- If the operation cannot be authorized, for example, if the UE does not have the required subscription data, the HSS returns a '403 Forbidden' status code with additional error information in the 'ProblemDetails' element of the response body.
- In case of redirection, the HSS returns a 3xx status code with a Location header pointing to the endpoint of another HSS instance.

If any errors occur during the process, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned, along with additional error information in the response body. This ensures that the UDM can handle the errors and take necessary actions to resolve them.

Upon receiving an update message, the conference focus is required to finalize the CLUE exchange and possibly update the SDP offer/answer according to clause 5 in IETF RFC 8848. If a session update is needed between the TP-enabled conference focus and other participants in the same conference, the conference focus must initiate the update procedures accordingly.

Additionally, it is important to note that the update of an ongoing IM session supporting telepresence may result in a session fallback to a normal IM session. This fallback occurs by disabling CLUE as specified in subclause 4.5.4.3 in IETF RFC 8848.","The answer must include the interaction of CLUE protocol and SDP negotiations as per IETF RFC 8848, the steps for CLUE data channel establishment when a TP UE joins a conference, and the procedures for the conference focus to handle updates, including finalizing CLUE exchange and updating SDP offer/answer. Additionally, it should mention the possibility of session fallback to a normal IM session."
Describe the handling of QoS flows and Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI) for uplink and downlink user data packets in non-3GPP and wireline accesses.,"The handling of QoS flows and Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI) for uplink and downlink user data packets in non-3GPP and wireline accesses involves several key procedures:

For uplink user data packets in trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses, the User Equipment (UE) associates the uplink user data packet with a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI). The UE then encapsulates the uplink user data packet and the associated QFI in the GRE header and selects an IPsec child Security Association (SA) based on the PDU session and QFI. In trusted non-3GPP access, the UE reserves non-3GPP access network QoS resources for the IPsec child SA according to the received Additional QoS Information when the selected IPsec child SA is established. In untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE may receive Additional QoS Information from the N3IWF during IPsec child SA establishment and may reserve non-3GPP access network QoS resources accordingly.

For uplink user data packets in wireline access, the 5G Residential Gateway (5G-RG) associates the uplink user data packet with a QFI, selects a Wireline User Plane (W-UP) resource based on the PDU session and QFI, and transports the uplink user data packet via the selected W-UP resource using means out of scope of the present specification.

For downlink user data packets in trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses, the User Plane Function (UPF) maps the user data packet to a QoS flow. The N3IWF for untrusted non-3GPP access and the TNGF for trusted non-3GPP access determine the IPsec child SA to use for sending the downlink user data packet based on the mapping of the QoS flow to the IPsec child SA, considering the QFI of the QoS flow and the identity of the PDU session. The TNGF may also reserve non-3GPP access network QoS resources for the IPsec child SA.

For downlink user data packets in wireline access, the UPF maps the user data packet to a QoS flow. The Wireline Access Gateway Function (W-AGF) serving the 5G-RG selects a W-UP resource for the downlink user data packet based on the mapping of the QoS flow to the W-UP resources, considering the QFI of the QoS flow and the identity of the PDU session. The W-AGF then transports the downlink user data packet and the associated QFI via the selected W-UP resource using means out of scope of the present specification.

Reflective QoS is supported when the UE accesses the 5G Core Network (5GCN) via non-3GPP access networks. If the N3IWF for untrusted non-3GPP access or the TNGF for trusted non-3GPP access receives a downlink user packet associated with Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI), they set the RQI in the GRE header when encapsulating the downlink user data packet. For wireline access, if the W-AGF serving the 5G-RG receives a downlink user packet associated with RQI, it transports the RQI together with the downlink user data packet and the associated QFI via the selected W-UP resource.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - How the UE handles uplink user data packets in trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses, including the association with QFI, encapsulation in GRE header, and selection of IPsec child SA.
  - How the UPF handles downlink user data packets in trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses, including mapping to QoS flows and selection of IPsec child SA.
  - The procedures for handling uplink and downlink user data packets in wireline access, including the association with QFI and selection of W-UP resources.
  - The support for Reflective QoS in non-3GPP access networks, including the setting of RQI in the GRE header for downlink user data packets.
  - The handling of downlink user data packets with RQI in wireline access, including the transport of RQI and QFI via selected W-UP resources."
Compare and contrast the measurement of Data Volume in the downlink and uplink as specified in 3GPP TS 32.425 clauses 4.4.7.1 and 4.4.7.2.,"The measurement of Data Volume in both the downlink and uplink as specified in 3GPP TS 32.425 clauses 4.4.7.1 and 4.4.7.2 share several similarities and differences.

Both measurements aim to provide the Data Volume (amount of PDCP SDU bits) delivered from the PDCP layer to the RLC layer. They are calculated per PLMN ID and per E-RAB QoS profile, which includes QCI, ARP, and GBR. The unit of measurement for both is Mbit, and each measurement is represented as an integer value.

For the downlink (clause 4.4.7.1), the measurement is performed by counting the number of bits entering the eNodeB/RN at the PDCP SDU level, per configured PLMN ID and DL QoS profile criteria. The measurement name format is DRB.PdcpSduVolumeDl_Filter, where the filter includes parameters such as PLMNID, QCImax, QCImin, ARPmax, ARPmin, and GBR. An example of a measurement name is DRB.PdcpSduVolumeDl_Plmn2Qci2-4Arp1-10Gbr3.

For the uplink (clause 4.4.7.2), the measurement is similarly performed by counting the number of bits entering the eNodeB/RN at the PDCP SDU level, per configured PLMN ID and UL QoS profile criteria. The measurement name format is DRB.PdcpSduVolumeUl_Filter, with the same filter parameters as the downlink. An example of a measurement name is DRB.PdcpSduVolumeUl_Plmn2Qci2-4Arp1-10Gbr3.

Both measurements are valid for packet switched traffic and are applicable to EPS. Additionally, they can be used by MOP for cross-operator accounting in shared networks.

In summary, while the fundamental principles and criteria for measuring Data Volume in the downlink and uplink are the same, the key difference lies in the direction of data flow being measured (downlink vs. uplink) and the corresponding measurement name formats (Dl vs. Ul).","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Definition and purpose of the measurements in both downlink and uplink.
  - Calculation criteria (per PLMN ID and E-RAB QoS profile).
  - Measurement unit (Mbit) and integer value representation.
  - Measurement name format and example.
  - Applicability to packet switched traffic and EPS.
  - Use in cross-operator accounting."
"Describe the architecture and functionality of UDR and UDSF in the 5G system, including their deployment, data storage, and access mechanisms.","In the 5G system architecture, both the User Data Repository (UDR) and the Unstructured Data Storage Function (UDSF) play crucial roles in data management and storage.

The UDR can be deployed in multiple instances, each storing specific data sets or subsets and serving particular Network Function (NF) consumers. These instances can store various types of data, such as subscription data, policy data, structured data for exposure, and application data applicable to any User Equipment (UE). The selection of the appropriate UDR instance by NF consumers involves utilizing the Network Repository Function (NRF) for discovery unless the UDR instance information is locally configured. Factors influencing UDR selection include the UDR Group ID, SUPI, GPSI or External Group ID, and the UDR's capability to store application data.

The UDSF, on the other hand, is designed to store unstructured data, which refers to data not defined in 3GPP specifications. Any NF can store and retrieve its unstructured data from the UDSF, which belongs to the same Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) as the NF. Control Plane (CP) NFs may share a UDSF or have individual UDSFs located close to them.

Access to data stored in the UDR is facilitated through the Nudr interface, which allows NF service consumers like UDM, PCF, and NEF to read, update, delete, and subscribe to notifications of data changes. Authorization for data access is performed by the UDR on a per data set and NF service consumer basis, ensuring that each NF can only modify the data it is authorized to change. The types of data stored in the UDR include subscription data, policy data, structured data for exposure, and application data such as Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application detection and AF request information for multiple UEs.

In summary, the UDR and UDSF are integral components of the 5G system architecture, providing structured and unstructured data storage, respectively. The UDR supports multiple instances for different data sets and NF consumers, with a robust selection and authorization mechanism, while the UDSF offers a flexible storage solution for unstructured data.","The answer must include details on the deployment of multiple UDR instances, the selection process for UDR instances by NF consumers, the factors influencing UDR selection, the role of UDSF in storing unstructured data, the Nudr interface for accessing UDR data, and the types of data stored in UDR. It should also cover the authorization mechanisms for data access and the distinction between structured and unstructured data."
Describe the procedure for retrieving OMA BCAST service selection information and how personalization headers are used in the HTTP POST request.,"The procedure for retrieving OMA BCAST service selection information involves obtaining one or more Service Guide Delivery Descriptors (SGDD) and/or Service Guide Delivery Units (SGDU). The SGDD provides service level information and access details to the Service Guide fragments, while the SGDU serves as a transport-independent network structure for encapsulating these fragments.

When the ESG SSF (Electronic Service Guide Service Selection Function) receives an HTTP POST request, it checks for the presence of personalization headers, which are provided as key-value pairs. These headers are used to build a personalized response. For example, the ESG SSF may use the provided user identity to retrieve the associated Parental Control Level from the user profile. This level is then used to filter out unsuitable elements from the ESG data that is sent back to the user. Additionally, the user identity can be used to retrieve a personalized ESG using the method specified in OMA BCAST Service Guide, clause 5.4.3.3.

The ESG SSF sends an HTTP response that conforms to the OMA BCAST Service Guide, clause 5.4.3.1. The body of this HTTP response contains an XML document with SGResponse data, which adheres to the specifications outlined in OMA BCAST Service Guide, clause 5.4.3.1.1.","The answer should include the steps for retrieving SGDD and SGDU, the role of personalization headers in building a personalized response, how the user identity is used to retrieve Parental Control Level and personalized ESG, and the format of the HTTP response including the XML document with SGResponse data."
Describe the acceptable uncertainty and measurement requirements for a 3GPP Test System as specified in TS 25.143.,"The acceptable uncertainty and measurement requirements for a 3GPP Test System as specified in TS 25.143 are detailed across several subclauses and an informative annex. 

Firstly, the maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified for each test, where appropriate, with all tolerances and uncertainties being absolute values valid for a confidence level of 95%. This means that the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement contains 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment. For RF tests, the uncertainties apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include system effects due to mismatch between the Device Under Test (DUT) and the Test System.

Measurement results returned by the Test System are compared against the Test Requirements as defined by the share risk principle, which is detailed in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5. The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for each parameter must be included in the test report, and the recorded value for the Test System uncertainty must be equal to or lower than the appropriate figure specified in subclause 5.1. If the Test System has a measurement uncertainty greater than that specified, it is still permitted to use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made to tighten the Test Requirement, making the test harder to pass. This ensures that a non-compliant Test System does not increase the chance of passing a DUT that would otherwise fail with a compliant Test System.

Each test follows a standard format, which includes the title, definition and applicability, minimum requirements, test purpose, method of test, and test requirements. The definition and applicability subclause specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or only to a certain subset. The minimum requirements subclause provides an informative copy of the Minimum Requirement defined by the core specification and references the relevant 3GPP specification. The test purpose subclause defines the purpose of the test, while the method of test subclause outlines the initial conditions and procedure for performing the test. The test requirements subclause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test.

The informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the components of an overall Test System, such as signal generators and signal analyzers, which are necessary for assembling a Test System that complies with the acceptable uncertainty specified in subclause 5.1. These parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the overall Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System Calibration, as detailed in Table C.1.","The answer should include the maximum acceptable uncertainty for the Test System, the confidence level required, and specific considerations for RF tests. It should explain how measurement results are compared against Test Requirements, the share risk principle, and the procedure for handling Test Systems with greater uncertainty. The standard format for tests should be outlined, including the definition, applicability, minimum requirements, test purpose, method of test, and test requirements. Additionally, the critical parameters of Test Equipment and their importance to the overall accuracy of the Test System should be covered, referencing Table C.1."
"Explain the process and conditions under which repeated FACCH blocks are sent and received in a 3GPP network, including the role of the Repeated ACCH Capability bit.","In a 3GPP network, repeated FACCH blocks are sent and received under specific conditions to ensure reliable communication. 

Firstly, the timing for sending repeated FACCH blocks is crucial. If the first burst of the downlink FACCH block containing the initial instance of a LAPDm frame is sent in TDMA frame M, the repeated instance of the LAPDm frame is sent in TDMA frame M+8 or M+9. The latter timing corresponds to scenarios where the two FACCH blocks are separated by either a SACCH frame or an idle frame. This timing ensures that the repeated block is properly spaced to allow for effective decoding.

The Base Station System (BSS) decides to repeat any downlink LAPDm command frame sent in a FACCH block based on implementation-dependent criteria, such as downlink measurements. If the Mobile Station (MS) has signaled the Repeated ACCH Capability bit as '1', the BSS may also decide to repeat any downlink LAPDm response frame sent in a FACCH block. This decision-making process allows the BSS to enhance communication reliability by repeating frames that might be critical for the MS to receive correctly.

When the MS receives a downlink FACCH block, it always attempts to decode it without combining it with any previously received FACCH block. If the current FACCH block is successfully decoded and an identical FACCH block was previously received (spaced in time as specified), the MS does not send the LAPDm frame of the current FACCH block to the LAPDm entity. However, if there was no previously received identical FACCH block, the LAPDm frame of the current FACCH block is sent to the LAPDm entity. If the current FACCH block is unsuccessfully decoded and there was an unsuccessfully decoded FACCH block spaced in time as specified, the MS performs a new decoding using information from both FACCH blocks. If this new decoding is successful, the LAPDm frame produced is sent to the LAPDm entity.

Additionally, on a channel using repeated downlink FACCH, the value of T200 should be increased. This adjustment helps cope with scenarios where the receiving entity fails to decode the downlink FACCH block used to send the first instance of a repeated LAPDm frame. This increase in T200 value applies to both the BSS supporting repeated downlink FACCH and the MS that has signaled the Repeated ACCH Capability bit as '1'.

In summary, the process of sending and receiving repeated FACCH blocks involves specific timing, criteria for repetition based on the Repeated ACCH Capability bit, and detailed decoding procedures to ensure reliable communication in a 3GPP network.","The answer should cover the following points: 
  - The timing and conditions for sending repeated FACCH blocks (TDMA frame M+8 or M+9).
  - The criteria used by the BSS to decide on repeating downlink LAPDm frames, including the role of the Repeated ACCH Capability bit.
  - The MS's process for decoding received FACCH blocks, including handling of identical blocks and combining information from unsuccessfully decoded blocks.
  - The impact on the T200 value when using repeated downlink FACCH."
Describe the procedures and requirements for an MCVideo function and client when using an MBMS bearer for transmission control messages and RTP media packets as specified in 3GPP TS 24.581.,"The procedures and requirements for an MCVideo function and client when using an MBMS bearer for transmission control messages and RTP media packets as specified in 3GPP TS 24.581 are as follows:

1. Activation and Announcement of MBMS Bearer: The MCVideo function must activate the MBMS bearer and announce it as described in clause 4.1.2. This is a prerequisite for using the MBMS bearer for transmissions in group calls.

2. Support for Transmission Control Messages and RTP Media Packets: A participating MCVideo function must support the procedures for sending transmission control messages and RTP media packets over the MBMS bearer. Similarly, an MCVideo client that supports receiving these messages and packets over an MBMS bearer must adhere to the procedures outlined in the relevant clauses.

3. Media Plane Security Procedures: The media plane security procedures for media and transmission control messages sent over the MBMS subchannels are specified in clause 13. These procedures ensure the secure transmission of data over the MBMS bearer.

4. Application of Forward Error Correction (FEC): The MCVideo function can apply FEC to the RTP media packets by generating repair packets to be sent over the MBMS subchannel. Alternatively, the MCVideo function can request the BM-SC to apply FEC, as described in 3GPP TS 23.280.

5. Assumption of Active and Announced MBMS Bearer: The procedures for an MCVideo client assume that the MBMS bearer is active and announced as per clause 4.1.2. This ensures that the client can properly receive transmission control messages and RTP media packets over the MBMS bearer.

These requirements and procedures ensure the effective and secure use of MBMS bearers for transmission control messages and RTP media packets in MCVideo functions and clients.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - The requirement for the MCVideo function to activate and announce the MBMS bearer as per clause 4.1.2.
  - The support for transmission control messages and RTP media packets over the MBMS bearer.

  - The application of FEC to RTP media packets either by the MCVideo function or by requesting the BM-SC to apply FEC.
  - The assumption that the MBMS bearer is active and announced for the MCVideo client to support receiving transmission control messages and RTP media packets."
"Describe the key establishment procedure between a Remote Device and a UICC Hosting Device, including the steps involved and the handling of errors.","The key establishment procedure between a Remote Device and a UICC Hosting Device involves several steps to ensure secure communication and key management. Here is a detailed outline of the process:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The procedure begins when the Remote Device has no valid Ks_local_device key stored. If the Remote Device has a list of NAF_IDs with NAF Key Centre functionality, it proceeds directly to step 5. Otherwise, it sends a request to the UICC Hosting Device to obtain this list.

2. **Requesting NAF_IDs**: The UICC Hosting Device responds by sending its list of available NAF_IDs with NAF Key Centre functionality to the Remote Device. The Remote Device then selects a NAF-ID from the provided list or proposes one stored in its own memory.

3. **Requesting B-TID and Ks_ext_NAF Keys**: The Remote Device sends a request to the UICC Hosting Device for a B-TID, including the selected NAF_ID. If the UICC Hosting Device does not have a valid B-TID, it performs a new bootstrapping procedure to generate the necessary keys (Ks_ext_NAF or CK and IK).

4. **Establishing Secure Tunnel**: Once the keys are generated, the UICC Hosting Device sends a response including the B-TID and NAF_ID to the Remote Device. The Remote Device and the NAF Key Centre then establish a secure tunnel, which can be an HTTPS tunnel with certificate-based mutual authentication or PSK TLS based on a shared key.

5. **Key Establishment with NAF Key Centre**: The Remote Device sends a service request message to the NAF Key Centre within the secure tunnel, including the B-TID and its identifier (Device_ID). The NAF Key Centre checks if the Device_ID is blocked (blacklisted) and, if so, terminates the connection with an error code. If not, it contacts the BSF to obtain the shared secret Ks_ext_NAF.

6. **Calculating and Storing Ks_local_device Key**: The NAF Key Centre calculates the Ks_local_device key from the Ks_ext_NAF, B-TID, NAF_ID, and Device_ID, and stores it locally with an associated key lifetime. It then sends a response to the Remote Device with the B-TID, Ks_local_device, and Key Lifetime.

7. **Error Handling**: Throughout the process, various error handling mechanisms are in place. If the UICC Hosting Device or Remote Device encounters an error due to mismatched Ks_local_device keys, they initiate a new key establishment procedure. Additionally, MAC verification is performed to ensure the integrity of the key establishment process. If the MAC values do not match, the procedure is terminated with a failure message.

8. **Final Steps**: The Remote Device stores the Ks_local_device key and associated parameters. It then sends a response to the UICC Hosting Device indicating the completion of the key establishment procedure, including the NAF_ID, Device-ID, B-TID, and Key Lifetime, along with a MAC value. The UICC Hosting Device verifies the MAC and, if successful, stores the Ks_local_device key and sends a verification response to the Remote Device.

This comprehensive procedure ensures secure key management and communication between the Remote Device and the UICC Hosting Device, with robust error handling mechanisms to address any issues that may arise during the process.","The answer should include:
1. The initial conditions for key establishment (e.g., no valid Ks_local_device key stored).
2. The process for requesting and receiving NAF_IDs with NAF Key Centre functionality.
3. The steps for requesting and receiving B-TID and Ks_ext_NAF keys.
4. The establishment of a secure tunnel and the key establishment procedure with the NAF Key Centre.
5. Error handling mechanisms, including blacklisting checks and MAC verification.
6. The final steps for storing and verifying the Ks_local_device key."
Describe the handling of the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute in different scenarios according to 3GPP TS 23.334 specifications.,"The 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute plays a crucial role in the handling of MSRP (Message Session Relay Protocol) in SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers and answers. According to 3GPP TS 23.334 specifications, the handling of this attribute varies depending on its presence or absence in the SDP messages.

1. **Presence of 'a=msrp-cema' SDP Attribute in SDP Offer:**
   - When a peer includes the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute in the first SDP offer, the IMS-ALG (Application Layer Gateway) must ensure that the IMS-AGW (Application Gateway) performs application-agnostic MSRP handling. This means the IMS-AGW should not be configured for application-aware MSRP interworking.
   - The IMS-ALG must indicate 'TCP' or 'TCP/TLS' (if end-to-end media security is applied) as the transport protocol to the IMS-AGW.
   - The IMS-ALG must forward the 'a=path' and 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attributes in the SDP offer without modification.
   - In the corresponding SDP answer, the IMS-ALG must forward the 'a=path' SDP attribute without modification, even if the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute is not present in the answer.

2. **Absence of 'a=msrp-cema' SDP Attribute in SDP Answer:**
   - If the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute is not present in the SDP answer and the 'a=path' SDP attribute is unmodified, the offerer will detect a mismatch and send a new SDP offer without the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute, following the procedures outlined in IETF RFC 6714.

3. **Absence of 'a=msrp-cema' SDP Attribute in SDP Offer:**
   - When the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute is not included in the SDP offer, the IMS-ALG must ensure that the IMS-AGW performs application-agnostic MSRP handling.
   - The IMS-ALG must indicate 'TCP' or 'TCP/TLS' (if end-to-end media security is applied) as the transport protocol to the IMS-AGW.
   - The IMS-ALG must replace the IP address and TCP port in the 'a=path' SDP attribute with the IP address and TCP port allocated for the media stream at the IMS-AGW before forwarding the SDP.

4. **Interworking Between Different MSRP Clients:**
   - For interworking between an MSRP client applying IETF RFC 6714 and an MSRP client applying IETF RFC 4975 without extensions, the IMS-ALG should include the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute in the SDP answer if it was present in the SDP offer.
   - When sending an SDP offer, the IMS-ALG should include the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute.
   - If the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute is not present in the received SDP answer and the SDP c/m-line address information does not match the 'a=path' attribute, the IMS-ALG should send a new SDP offer without the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute, following the procedures in IETF RFC 6714.

In summary, the handling of the 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute involves specific actions by the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW to ensure proper MSRP interworking and media stream management, depending on whether the attribute is present or absent in the SDP messages.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute in SDP offers and answers.
- Actions required by IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW when 'a=msrp-cema' SDP attribute is present or absent.
- Specific procedures for interworking between different MSRP clients.
- Replacement of IP address and TCP port in 'a=path' SDP attribute when 'a=msrp-cema' is not present."

Describe the process and attributes involved when NAT is detected between the H(e)NB and SeGW according to 3GPP TS 29.139.,"When NAT is detected between the H(e)NB and SeGW, the H(e)NB initiates a request to the SeGW to return its local IP address information. This is done by including the EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute in the CFG_REQUEST Configuration Payload within the IKE_AUTH request message. The length field of this attribute is set to zero, and the NATed IPv4 Address field and UDP Port number field are absent.

The format of the EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute follows the definition of Configuration Attributes as specified in IETF RFC 5996, section 3.15.1. The attribute can have a length of either 0 or 6 bytes, and the Attribute Type indicating EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO is assigned the value 23.

Describe the procedures for key re-negotiation and session setup in BEST services using EMSDP as specified in TS 33.163.,"The procedures for key re-negotiation and session setup in BEST services using EMSDP involve several entities and steps. Key re-negotiation can be triggered by the User Equipment (UE), Home Subscriber Entity (HSE), or External Application Server (EAS) during a BEST session. The HSE may throttle or not support UE-triggered key renegotiation to avoid overloading. Newly generated keys take effect immediately for EMSDP-based BEST User Plane (UP) services.

The HSE may optionally support UE-initiated key refresh, which it signals to the UE in the Session Start message. If the HSE does not support it, it will ignore UE-triggered key refresh messages. EAS-triggered re-negotiation applies to BEST UP Service in UE-to-EAS mode, where the newly derived pre-shared key (EAS PSK) may be sent by the HSE to the EAS.

For the BEST Session setup procedure for Key Agreement Only service using EMSDP, the EAS PSK is provided by the HSE to the EAS, and the UE derives all required keys. The EAS can obtain the EAS PSK anytime after the session setup by initiating an EAS Session Request message with the required Key Id. The key refresh procedure involves specific steps, with some being mandatory and others optional depending on the HSE's configuration.

The procedures for different BEST services using EMSDP are detailed as follows:
- BEST key agreement only service: The setup and key refresh procedures involve the exchange of messages between the UE, HSE, HSS/EMKS, and EAS, with specific steps outlined in the respective clauses.
- BEST user plane integrity protected service: The setup and key refresh procedures involve mandatory steps for message exchanges, with additional steps performed when a BEST UE-to-EAS UP session is set up.
- BEST user plane confidential service: The procedures are the same as those detailed in clause 6.7.4.3.

"Describe the structure and usage of the 'ProblemDetails' data type in 3GPP 5GC APIs, including its attributes, extensions, and naming conventions.","The 'ProblemDetails' data type is a JSON object used in 3GPP 5GC APIs to provide detailed error information when the HTTP status code alone is insufficient. The basic structure of 'ProblemDetails' includes the following standard attributes:
- 'type': A URI reference that identifies the problem type.
- 'title': A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
- 'status': The HTTP status code for this occurrence of the problem.
- 'detail': A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
- 'instance': A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.

In addition to these standard attributes, 3GPP 5GC APIs define two additional attributes:
- 'cause': A machine-readable application error cause specific to this occurrence of the problem, using the UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORE case convention.
- 'invalidParams': Invalid parameters causing a request to be rejected.

The 'ProblemDetails' data type should be included in error responses when the HTTP status code does not provide enough information or when detailed error information is necessary. The 'Content-Type' header for such responses should be set to 'application/problem+json'.

For service operations that need to provide additional application-specific information in error responses, the 'ProblemDetails' data type can be extended to 'Extended-ProblemDetails'. This extension reuses the 'ProblemDetails' common data type to maintain backward compatibility. The 'Content-Type' header for responses containing 'Extended-ProblemDetails' should also be set to 'application/problem+json'.

Naming conventions for attributes in the 'ProblemDetails' data structure follow specific guidelines in 5GC SBI service APIs, including UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORE, lower_with_underscore, UPPER-WITH-HYPHEN, lower-with-hyphen, UpperCamel, and lowerCamel.

The formal definition of the 'ProblemDetails' data type is specified in 3GPP TS 29.571, ensuring consistency and standardization across 5GC APIs.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The basic structure of the 'ProblemDetails' data type, including its standard attributes (type, title, status, detail, instance).
- The conditions under which 'ProblemDetails' should be included in error responses.
- The additional attributes defined for 3GPP 5GC APIs (cause, invalidParams) and their usage.
- How to extend 'ProblemDetails' to 'Extended-ProblemDetails' for additional application-specific information while ensuring backward compatibility.
- The naming conventions for attributes in the 'ProblemDetails' data structure, as per 5GC SBI service APIs.
- Reference to the formal definition of 'ProblemDetails' in 3GPP TS 29.571."
"How is the Nsoraf_SOR service API structured according to 3GPP specifications, and what are the key components of its URI?","The Nsoraf_SOR service API is structured according to the guidelines provided in 3GPP TS 29.550 and TS 29.501. The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the NF service producer follows the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501, which is: {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>.

The key components of this URI are:
- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts including the scheme ('http' or 'https'), the fixed string '://', the authority (host and optional port) as defined in IETF RFC 3986, and an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character. The host should be represented by the operator-specific FQDN.
- <apiName>: For the Nsoraf_SOR service API, this is set to 'nsoraf-sor'.
- <apiVersion>: This indicates the major version of the API, which is 'v1' for the Nsoraf_SOR service API.
- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 6.1.3 of 3GPP TS 29.550.

An example of an API URI from another 3GPP specification (TS 29.502) is: '{apiRoot}/nsmf-pdusession/v1'. This example illustrates the structure and how the components are concatenated to form the complete URI.","The answer should include the structure of the Nsoraf_SOR service API URI as defined in TS 29.550 6.1.1, specifying the values for {apiRoot}, <apiName>, <apiVersion>, and <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>.

Describe the behavior of the floor participant interface toward the MCPTT client when it receives different types of floor control messages from the floor control server interface.,"The behavior of the floor participant interface toward the MCPTT client varies depending on the type of floor control message received from the floor control server interface:

1. **Floor Idle Message**:
   - The interface sends the Floor Idle message to the MCPTT floor participant.
   - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Idle message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface stores an indication that a Floor Ack message to the Floor Idle message is expected.
   - The interface remains in the 'P: has no permission' state.

2. **Floor Taken Message**:
   - The interface sends the Floor Taken message to the MCPTT floor participant.
   - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Taken message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface stores an indication that a Floor Ack message to the Floor Taken message is expected.
   - The interface remains in the 'P: has no permission' state.

3. **Floor Granted Message**:
   - The interface sends the Floor Granted message to the MCPTT floor participant.
   - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Granted message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface stores an indication that a Floor Ack message to the Floor Granted message is expected.
   - The interface enters the 'P: has permission' state.

4. **Floor Deny Message**:
   - The interface sends the Floor Deny message to the MCPTT floor participant.
   - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Deny message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface stores an indication that a Floor Ack message to the Floor Deny message is expected.
   - The interface remains in the 'P: has no permission' state.

5. **Floor Queue Position Info Message**:
   - The interface sends the Floor Queue Position Info message to the MCPTT floor participant.
   - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Queue Position Info message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface stores an indication that a Floor Ack message to the Floor Queue Position Info message is expected.
   - The interface remains in the 'P: has no permission' state.

6. **Floor Release Message**:
   - If a Floor Release message is not expected from the MCPTT floor participant:
     - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Release message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), based on local policy, the interface either sends a Floor Ack message to the MCPTT floor participant and sets the first bit in the subtype of the outgoing Floor Release message to '0' (indicating that an acknowledgement is not required), or waits for the Floor Ack from the floor control server.
     - The interface forwards the Floor Release message to the floor control server interface.
   - If a Floor Release message is expected from the MCPTT floor participant:
     - If the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Release message is set to '1' (indicating that an acknowledgement is required), the interface sends a Floor Ack message to the MCPTT floor participant.
     - The interface removes the indication that a Floor Release message is expected from the floor participant.
   - The interface remains in the 'P: has no permission' state.","The answer should cover the specific actions taken by the floor participant interface toward the MCPTT client for each type of floor control message. This includes sending the message to the MCPTT floor participant, handling acknowledgements if required, and the state the interface remains in ('P: has no permission' or 'P: has permission'). Additionally, for the Floor Release message, the answer should detail the different handling based on whether the message is expected or not."
What are the minimum requirements for PUCCH format 2 in terms of CQI block error probability and false alarm probability according to 3GPP TS 36.104 and TS 36.141?,"The minimum requirements for PUCCH format 2 in terms of CQI block error probability and false alarm probability are specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 and reiterated in TS 36.141. According to TS 36.104 subclause 8.3.3.1, the CQI block error probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR levels given in tables 8.3.3.1-1 for 1Tx and 8.3.3.1-2 for 2Tx cases. Additionally, TS 36.104 subclause 8.3.8 specifies that it is optional for a base station (BS) to support PUCCH format 2 with Discontinuous Transmission (DTX). If supported, the BS may meet the requirements specified in subclause 8.3.8.1 instead of those in subclause 8.3.3.1. In subclause 8.3.8.1, the CQI false alarm probability shall not exceed 10% and the CQI block error probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR levels given in table 8.3.8.1-1. The definitions of CQI block error probability and false alarm probability are provided in subclause 8.3.8, where the CQI block error probability is defined as the sum of the conditional probability of incorrectly decoding the CQI information when sent and the conditional probability of detecting UE transmission as DTX when CQI information is sent. The CQI false alarm probability is defined as the conditional probability of falsely detecting CQI information transmitted from UE when no CQI information is sent.

"Describe the procedures for establishing and terminating Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect) in roaming scenarios, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213.","The procedures for establishing and terminating Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect) in roaming scenarios, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213, involve several key steps and roles.

For the establishment of Diameter sessions:
1. The V-PCRF receives an external trigger, such as an IP-CAN session establishment request, requiring the establishment of a Diameter session with an H-PCRF over the S9 reference point.
2. The V-PCRF sends a Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request with user information to the H-DRA (redirect) in the home PLMN.
3. The H-DRA (redirect) stores the user information and checks for an active DRA binding. If none exists, it creates a dynamic DRA binding. If a binding exists, it selects the PCRF from the binding for the client.
4. The H-DRA (redirect) sends a Diameter Answer indicating redirection, including the target PCRF identity in the Redirect-Host AVP.
5. The V-PCRF re-sends the Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request to the target H-PCRF.
6. The H-PCRF returns a corresponding Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF.

For the termination of Diameter sessions:
1. The client receives an external trigger, such as an IP-CAN session termination initiated by the UE or PCRF, triggering the termination of the Diameter session with the server (PCRF).
2. The client sends a Diameter Termination Request to the DRA (redirect).
3. The client sends a Diameter Termination Request to PCRF-1, using the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session.
4. The DRA (redirect) verifies the active DRA binding for the IP-CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session terminated. If all Diameter sessions of the IP-CAN session or UE are terminated, the DRA removes the DRA binding.
5. The DRA (redirect) acknowledges the termination of the session by sending a Diameter redirect answer to the client.
6. PCRF-1 acknowledges the termination of the session by sending a Diameter Answer to the client.

For the termination of S9 Diameter sessions:
1. The V-PCRF receives an external trigger, such as a session termination request from the BBERF or PCEF, requiring the sending of a Diameter Termination Request.
2. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter Termination Request to the H-DRA (redirect) in the home PLMN.
3. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter Termination Request to H-PCRF-1, using the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session.
4. The H-DRA (redirect) verifies the active DRA binding for the IP-CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session terminated. If all Diameter sessions of the UE are terminated, the H-DRA removes the DRA binding.
5. The H-DRA (redirect) acknowledges the termination of the session by sending a Diameter redirect answer to the V-PCRF.
6. H-PCRF-1 acknowledges the termination of the session by sending a Diameter answer to the V-PCRF.

Throughout these processes, cached route table entries created from previous DRA (redirect) interactions play a crucial role. These entries are created from the Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage, and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as described in IETF RFC 6733.","The answer must include the detailed steps for establishing Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect) in roaming scenarios, highlighting the roles of V-PCRF and H-DRA, and the caching of route table entries. It should also cover the procedures for terminating Diameter sessions, including gateway control session termination, IP-CAN session termination, and S9 session termination, emphasizing the roles of DRA client and PCRF, and the importance of caching route table entries."
"Explain the construction and mapping of TLLI and P-TMSI in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN networks, including the roles of NRI and MME Code.","The construction and mapping of TLLI (Temporary Logical Link Identity) and P-TMSI (Packet Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) in GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network), UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network), and E-UTRAN (Evolved UTRAN) networks involve several key processes and bit assignments.

1. **Construction of TLLI**:
   - **Local TLLI**: Built by an MS (Mobile Station) with a valid P-TMSI. Bits 31 and 30 are set to 1, and bits 29 to 0 are set equal to bits 29 to 0 of the P-TMSI.
   - **Foreign TLLI**: Built by an MS with a valid P-TMSI. Bit 31 is set to 1, bit 30 is set to 0, and bits 29 to 0 are set equal to bits 29 to 0 of the P-TMSI.
   - **Random TLLI**: Built by an MS. Bit 31 is set to 0, bits 30 to 27 are set to 1, and bits 0 to 26 are chosen randomly.
   - **Auxiliary TLLI**: Built by the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node). Bit 31 is set to 0, bits 30 to 28 are set to 1, bit 27 is set to 0, and bits 0 to 26 can be assigned independently.

2. **Structure and Mapping of P-TMSI**:
   - The P-TMSI is 32 bits long, with the two topmost bits reserved and always set to '11'. This ensures compatibility for UEs (User Equipment) that may handover to GERAN/UTRAN.
   - The NRI (Network Resource Identifier) field is of variable length and is mapped into the P-TMSI starting at bit 23 and down to bit 14. The most significant bit of the NRI is located at bit 23 of the P-TMSI.

3. **Role and Length of NRI**:
   - The NRI is used to identify the SGSN within the network and is limited to a maximum of 8 bits to ensure compatibility with the MME (Mobility Management Entity) Code within the GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Identifier).

4. **Reverse Mapping Process by MME**:
   - When a new SGSN attempts to retrieve UE information from the old MME, the MME maps the RAI (Routeing Area Identity), P-TMSI (or TLLI), and P-TMSI Signature to create the GUTI and compare it with the stored GUTI. The MME performs a reverse mapping where the E-UTRAN MME Code within the GUTI is set to bits 23 to 16 of the GERAN/UTRAN P-TMSI (NRI field) or to the GERAN/UTRAN RAC (Routing Area Code).

5. **Mapping Process from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN**:
   - When a UE moves from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN, it maps the GUTI to an RAI, a P-TMSI, and a P-TMSI Signature. The E-UTRAN MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code) map directly to GERAN/UTRAN MCC and MNC. The E-UTRAN MME Group ID maps to GERAN/UTRAN LAC (Location Area Code), and the E-UTRAN MME Code maps to GERAN/UTRAN RAC and is copied into the 8 most significant bits of the NRI field within the P-TMSI. The E-UTRAN M-TMSI is mapped into the GERAN/UTRAN P-TMSI and P-TMSI Signature fields accordingly.

These processes ensure seamless mobility and identity management across different network types, maintaining the integrity and continuity of user sessions.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The construction rules for different types of TLLI, including bit assignments.
- The structure and mapping of P-TMSI, including the reserved bits and the inclusion of NRI.
- The role and length of NRI in the mapping process and its compatibility with MME Code.
- The reverse mapping process performed by MME to retrieve UE context.
- The mapping process when a UE transitions from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN, including the conversion of GUTI to RAI, P-TMSI, and P-TMSI Signature."
Describe the interfaces and protocols used for communication between SGSN and HLR/HSS in different modes as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060.,"The communication between SGSN and HLR/HSS involves several interfaces and protocols depending on the mode of operation. In general, the HLR/HSS contains GPRS and EPS subscription data and routing information and is accessible from the Gn/Gp SGSN via the Gr interface, from the S4-SGSN via the S6d interface, and from the GGSN via the Gc interface. For roaming mobile stations (MSs), the HLR/HSS may be located in a different Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) than the current SGSN.

In A/Gb mode, the Mobility Management (MM) procedures use the Logical Link Control (LLC) and Radio Link Control/Medium Access Control (RLC/MAC) protocols for message transmission across the Gb and Um interfaces. These procedures provide information to the underlying layers to ensure reliable transmission of MM messages on the Um interface. The mapping between LLC and the radio channels used is defined in TS 43.064. Additionally, MM procedures use MAP interfaces between Gn/Gp SGSN and HLR (Gr), between SGSN and Equipment Identity Register (EIR) (Gf), and a BSSAP+ interface between SGSN and Mobile Switching Center/Visitor Location Register (MSC/VLR) (Gs). Between S4-SGSN and HSS, the interface is Diameter based (S6d), although the use of MAP based Gr between the S4-SGSN and HSS is not precluded to assist with SGSN transition.

In Iu mode, MM procedures use the Radio Access Network Application Part (RANAP) and Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocols for message transmission across the Iu and radio interfaces, respectively. Similar to A/Gb mode, MM procedures use MAP interfaces for communication with HLR and EIR, and a BSSAP+ interface for communication with MSC/VLR.

For communication between S4-SGSN and HSS, the Diameter Base Protocol as defined in RFC 3588 is used along with various Diameter Applications necessary for operation. The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) guarantees delivery of upper layer packets between SGSN and HSS with a built-in redundancy scheme, as defined in RFC 4960.

Regarding user data transmission during MM signalling procedures, in A/Gb mode, user data transmitted during attach, authentication, and routing area update procedures may be lost and may need to be retransmitted. To minimize the need for retransmission, the MS and SGSN should avoid transmitting user data during attach and authentication procedures. During routing area update procedures, user data transfer is allowed with restrictions specified in the relevant clauses.

Overall, the interfaces and protocols used for communication between SGSN and HLR/HSS are designed to ensure reliable and efficient transmission of subscription data and routing information, with considerations for transitioning between different modes and minimizing data loss during signalling procedures.","The answer should cover the different interfaces used for communication between SGSN and HLR/HSS, including Gr, S6d, and Gc. It should explain the MM procedures and protocols used in A/Gb mode and Iu mode, such as LLC, RLC/MAC, RANAP, and RRC. Additionally, it should mention the protocols used for communication between S4-SGSN and HSS, including Diameter Base+Apps and SCTP. The answer should also include the notes on the use of MAP based Gr for SGSN transition and the considerations for user data transmission during MM signalling procedures."
Explain the process and API operations involved in triggering and updating location reporting in a 3GPP VAL system.,"In a 3GPP VAL system, the process of triggering and updating location reporting involves several steps and specific API operations. 

Firstly, the information flow from the location management client or VAL server to the location management server is crucial for initiating a location reporting procedure. This is described in Table 9.3.2.4-1, which outlines the necessary data exchange to trigger the location reporting.

The high-level procedure for client-triggered or VAL server-triggered location reporting is illustrated in Figure 9.3.5-1. The steps involved are as follows:
1. The location management client 2 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL server sends a location reporting trigger to the location management server to activate a location reporting procedure for obtaining the location information of location management client 1. This step can be performed when there is a need to update the location reporting trigger.
2. The location management server checks whether the location management client 2 or VAL server is authorized to send a location reporting trigger. Based on the information specified by the trigger, the server initiates either an on-demand or event-triggered location reporting procedure for the location of location management client 1.
3. Once the location information of location management client 1 is available, the location management server sends a location information report to the location management client 2 or VAL server.

Regarding API operations, the 'Create_Trigger_Location_Reporting' API operation is used to create the trigger for reporting location information. The known consumer of this API is the VAL server, and the inputs and outputs for this operation are detailed in subclause 9.3.2.4. For usage details, refer to subclause 9.3.5.

Similarly, the 'Update_Trigger_Location_Reporting' API operation is used to update the trigger for reporting location information. Like the 'Create' operation, the known consumer is the VAL server, and the inputs and outputs are specified in subclause 9.3.2.4. Usage details can also be found in subclause 9.3.5.

In summary, the process involves initiating a trigger, verifying authorization, and reporting location information, with specific API operations available for creating and updating these triggers.","The answer should cover the following key details:
  - The initial information flow required to trigger a location reporting procedure.
  - The steps involved in the client-triggered or VAL server-triggered location reporting process.
  - The role and usage of the 'Create_Trigger_Location_Reporting' API operation, including its inputs and outputs.
  - The role and usage of the 'Update_Trigger_Location_Reporting' API operation, including its inputs and outputs."
Describe the process and outcomes when a Terminal Equipment (TE) requests the transfer of an SMS message to a Mobile Termination (MT) using the INSERT SMS command as per 3GPP TS 27.005 specifications.,"The INSERT SMS command is used by the Terminal Equipment (TE) to request the transfer of an SMS message to the Mobile Termination (MT). The TE can request the MT to either store the message, send it over the air interface, or both. The command includes the full SMS message and header, formatted according to 3GPP TS 23.040, except for the TP-Message-Reference, which is allocated by the MT.

When the TE requests the MT to store the message, the MT attempts to store it and responds with an INSERT SMS COMPLETE indication if successful, including the message reference allocated by the MT. If the storage attempt fails, the MT returns an INSERT SMS FAILURE indication with the cause of the failure.

If the TE requests the MT to send the message, the MT immediately responds with a REQUEST CONFIRMED message and attempts to send the message. If the send attempt succeeds, the MT sends an INSERT SMS COMPLETE indication with the message reference. If the send attempt fails, the MT returns an INSERT SMS FAILURE indication with the cause of the failure.

If the TE requests the MT to both store and send the message, the MT first attempts to store the message. If storage is unavailable, the MT returns an INSERT SMS FAILURE indication and does not attempt to send the message. If storage is available, the MT stores the message, responds with a REQUEST CONFIRMED message, and then attempts to send the message. If the send attempt succeeds, the MT returns an INSERT SMS COMPLETE indication with the message reference. If the send attempt fails, the MT returns an INSERT SMS FAILURE indication with the cause of the failure and deletes the stored message.

The INSERT SMS COMPLETE response indicates that the TE's request to insert a message has been completed, while the INSERT SMS FAILURE response indicates that the attempt to insert an SMS message failed.","The answer should include:
  - The purpose of the INSERT SMS command and the role of the TE and MT.
  - The three possible actions the TE can request (store, send, or both).
  - The process the MT follows for each action, including the handling of the TP-Message-Reference.
  - The conditions under which the MT sends an INSERT SMS COMPLETE or INSERT SMS FAILURE response.
  - The significance of the REQUEST CONFIRMED message in the process."
Describe the performance evaluation of SACCH and SACCH enhancement techniques in MUROS mode based on 3GPP TS 45.914 specifications.,"The performance evaluation of SACCH and SACCH enhancement techniques in MUROS mode based on 3GPP TS 45.914 specifications involves several key aspects:

1. **General Parameters for Evaluation**: The general parameters for evaluating MUROS candidate techniques are outlined in TS 45.914, which include various metrics and conditions under which the techniques are assessed.

2. **Simulation Assumptions**: The link level performance of AMR speech channels, SACCH, and SACCH enhancements in the downlink (DL) has been evaluated through simulations under interference-limited scenarios. The specific conditions include:
   - Scenario: MTS-2, typical urban
   - Terminal speed: 3 km/h
   - Ideal frequency hopping (TU3iFH)
   - Speech codecs: TCH/AFS4.75 and TCH/AHS4.75
   - Downlink receiver: DARP Phase I terminal
   - Both DTX mode and non-DTX mode cases are evaluated
   - Subchannel power imbalance ratio (SCPIR) values of -3 dB and 0 dB

3. **Performance Results**: The performance of SACCH and SACCH enhancements is evaluated based on the average number of SACCH blocks required per PC/TA command and the throughput of SACCH Layer 1 commands. Key findings include:
   - The average number of SACCH blocks for transmitting one PC/TA command decreases with an increase in C/I values.
   - RSACCH-1, SSACCH, and DRSACCH combinations yield the least number of required SACCH blocks for transmission of a PC/TA command.
   - RSACCH-2 improves legacy SACCH throughput at low C/I values but halves the throughput at high C/I values.
   - RSACCH-1 yields better performance than RSACCH-2 at bad channel conditions and better or close performance compared to legacy SACCH at good channel conditions.
   - DRSACCH alone or combined with SSACCH yields better SACCH information throughput than RSACCH.

4. **Throughput Gains Comparison**: The throughput gains of DRSACCH against RSACCH and SACCH are evaluated at specific C/I values:
   - At C/I of 5 dB (SCPIR=0 dB), DRSACCH yields better throughput performance than RSACCH and SACCH.
   - At C/I of 7.75 dB (SCPIR=-3 dB), DRSACCH combined with SSACCH and/or RSACCH results in significant throughput gains over RSACCH and SACCH.

Overall, the evaluation demonstrates that SACCH enhancement techniques, particularly DRSACCH and its combinations with SSACCH and RSACCH, provide substantial improvements in SACCH information throughput under various interference conditions.","The answer should include:
- The general parameters used for evaluating MUROS candidate techniques.
- The specific simulation assumptions for evaluating SACCH and SACCH enhancements in the downlink, including the interference scenarios, terminal speed, frequency hopping, and speech codecs.
- The performance results of SACCH and SACCH enhancements, focusing on the average number of SACCH blocks required per PC/TA command and the throughput of SACCH Layer 1 commands.
- The comparison of throughput gains of DRSACCH against RSACCH and SACCH at different C/I values, highlighting the improvements in SACCH information throughput."
"Describe the capabilities and functionalities of an ICS UE, including the reference points it supports and the conditions under which they are used.","An ICS UE (IMS Centralized Services User Equipment) is an IMS UE (IP Multimedia Subsystem User Equipment) with additional ICS-related capabilities. These capabilities include communication with the SCC AS (Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server) for service control signalling, establishment of the Bearer Control Signalling Path to set up media through the CS (Circuit Switched) domain, execution of ADS (Access Domain Selection) for originating sessions, and assisting the SCC AS in the execution of T-ADS (Terminating Access Domain Selection) when the Gm reference point is used.

The ICS UE supports the Gm reference point, which is defined in TS 23.228, and it is used for service control signalling when the PS (Packet Switched) network is available. Since an ICS UE is based on an IMS UE, the Gm reference point is always supported.

Additionally, the ICS UE may support the I1 reference point, which is used for service control signalling over CS access. The I1 reference point is used only when the home operator has preconfigured it and when the PS network is not available, such as when the ICS UE is camping on a GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network) with no DTM (Dual Transfer Mode) available. The I1 reference point performs functions such as optional session setup via CS access for mobile originating and terminating sessions, optional signalling for additional IMS parameter exchange during session setup, and IMS services control via CS access.

If the ICS UE supports Gm ICS and has a single call for which CS procedures are being used and Gm is not being used for service control, it may add the Gm service control signalling path. If it does not add the Gm service control signalling path, it will continue to use CS procedures for service control and for establishing additional calls until all ongoing calls end. An ICS UE that supports Gm ICS may have a call for which Gm is not being used for service control if, for example, a handover has occurred from an access network that doesn't support Gm, or after CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback).","The answer must include a detailed description of the ICS UE's capabilities, including its ability to communicate with the SCC AS, establish Bearer Control Signalling Paths, and execute ADS. It should explain the support for the Gm reference point and the conditions under which the I1 reference point is used. Additionally, it should cover how the ICS UE handles single calls using CS procedures and the scenarios where Gm is not used for service control."
Describe the procedures and requirements for through-connecting bearer terminations in multimedia calls as specified in 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 23.231.,"The procedures and requirements for through-connecting bearer terminations in multimedia calls are detailed in 3GPP TS 23.205 and TS 23.231. 

According to TS 23.205 6.1.2.7, during the Prepare Bearer or Reserve Circuit procedures, the MSC server uses the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to through-connect the bearer terminations. This ensures that the bearer is backward through-connected, as illustrated in figure 6.4. For multimedia calls, the MSC may request the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure to generate a multimedia Customised Alerting Tone (CAT), as described in clause 14.10.1. If the MSC server receives the answer indication, it requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer using the same procedure.

TS 23.231 6.1.1.7 further elaborates that in combination with the Prepare Bearer or Reserve Circuit procedures, and the Reserve RTP Connection Point or Configure RTP Connection Point procedure, the MSC server should use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to configure the bearer terminations for backward through-connection. For multimedia calls, the MSC may request the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure to generate a multimedia CAT, as referenced in clause 14.10.1. Upon receiving the answer indication (200 OK(INVITE)), the MSC server shall request the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer unless it has already been done at an earlier stage.

Regarding the Customised Alerting Tone (CAT), TS 23.205 14.10.1 specifies that CAT may be provided from a CAT Server switched into the call at appropriate trigger points. The CAT Server is outside the scope of the 3GPP architecture, and thus the signalling procedures towards the CAT Server are not described. The Forward CAT indicators and Backward CAT indicators information elements are specified in 3GPP TS 29.205. Extensions to basic call handling are described, with basic call protocol handling support remaining unchanged unless explicitly stated.

TS 23.231 14.10.1 simply refers to TS 23.205 clause 14.10.1 for details on multimedia CAT.

In summary, the MSC server uses the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to through-connect bearer terminations, either backward or both-way, depending on the call type and stage. For multimedia calls, this procedure is used to generate a multimedia CAT, with the CAT Server and related indicators specified in TS 23.205.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The Change Through-Connection procedure used by the MSC server to request the MGW to through-connect bearer terminations.
- The specific conditions under which backward and both-way through-connection are requested for multimedia calls.
- The role and handling of Customised Alerting Tone (CAT) in multimedia calls, including the CAT server and related indicators.
- The integration of these procedures with Prepare Bearer, Reserve Circuit, Reserve RTP Connection Point, and Configure RTP Connection Point procedures."
"Describe the procedure for testing the BER of a wanted signal at the TAB connector under test, including the setup of the wanted and interfering signals.","The procedure for testing the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a wanted signal at the TAB connector under test involves several steps:

1. **Generate the Wanted Signal**: The wanted signal should be generated according to the test configurations specified in clause 4.11. The input level to the TAB connector under test should be adjusted according to the values provided in table 7.4.5.3-1. The UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in clause A.2.1 should be used for each wanted carrier.

2. **Set Up the Interfering Signal**: The interfering signal should be set up at the adjacent channel frequency. The level of the interfering signal at the TAB connector should be adjusted according to table 7.4.5.3-1. The interfering signal is equivalent to a continuous CDMA signal with one code of chip frequency 1.28 Mchip/s, filtered by an RRC transmit pulse-shaping filter with a roll-off factor of 0.22.

3. **Measure the BER**: The BER of the wanted signal should be measured at the receiver unit associated with the TAB connector under test.

4. **Multi-band TAB Connectors**: For multi-band TAB connectors and single band tests, the above steps should be repeated for each involved band. Single band test configurations and test models should be applied with no carrier activated in the other band.

By following these steps, the BER of the wanted signal at the TAB connector under test can be accurately measured, ensuring compliance with the specified standards.","The answer must include the steps for generating the wanted signal according to the test configurations in clause 4.11, adjusting the input level to the TAB connector under test, setting up the interfering signal at the adjacent channel frequency, and measuring the BER of the wanted signal at the receiver unit associated with the TAB connector under test. Additionally, it should cover the procedure for multi-band TAB connectors and single band tests."
"Describe the procedures and actions taken by the SGSN and BSS during a cell change for an MS, including the handling of LLC-PDUs and the communication between SGSN and BSS.","During a cell change for a Mobile Station (MS), the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) follow specific procedures to manage the transfer or deletion of Logical Link Control Protocol Data Units (LLC-PDUs) and ensure seamless communication.

When the SGSN detects a cell change from a cell update or a routing area update, it initiates the process by sending a FLUSH-LL PDU to the old BVC (BSSGP Virtual Connection). The actions taken depend on the type of cell change:

1. **Cell Change within One NSE and Routing Area**: LLC-PDUs for a given Temporary Logical Link Identity (TLLI) stored at the old BVCI (corresponding to the old cell) are either deleted or transferred to the new BVCI (corresponding to the new cell) with which the TLLI is currently associated.

Describe the encoding rules and padding requirements for GSM System Information messages and GSM Measurement Information messages as specified in 3GPP TS 34.123.,"The GSM System Information messages, specifically SI 5 and SI 6, are transmitted as a B4 frame on the SACCH. These messages are defined to have a maximum length of 19 octets according to 3GPP TS 44.006, clause 8.8.3. In the TTCN, encoding rule 4 is applied to these messages. The implementation must ensure that after encoding the message contents defined in the TTCN, the remainder of the message, up to the fixed length of 19 octets, is filled with 'spare padding'.

Similarly, the GSM Measurement Information message is sent as a Bter UI frame on the SACCH. This message is defined to have a maximum length of 21 octets as per 3GPP TS 44.006, clause 8.8.3.

"Describe the procedure for UAV controller replacement as outlined in the 3GPP TS 23.256 document, including the interactions between USS, NEF, and PCF, and the steps involved in the authorization and update process.","The procedure for UAV controller (UAV-C) replacement as outlined in the 3GPP TS 23.256 document involves several steps and interactions between the USS (UAV Service Supplier), NEF (Network Exposure Function), and PCF (Policy Control Function). 

Initially, a UAV has already established user plane connectivity for Command and Control (C2) operation. The USS determines that the UAV-C controlling the UAV needs to be replaced, for example, if the UAV is misbehaving. The USS initiates the UAV-C replacement by invoking the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update request. This request includes necessary information such as Transaction Reference ID, UAV-UAVC Pairing info/Flow description(s), and QoS reference.

The NEF then authorizes the request from the USS and interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request. The NEF provides relevant parameters to the PCF, which uses this information to derive new PCC (Policy and Charging Control) rules to allow C2 communication between the UAV and the new UAV controller. The PCF determines whether the request is authorized and if the requested QoS is allowed. The PCF informs the NEF if the request is accepted by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update Response.

Following this, the NEF sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update response message to the USS, indicating whether the request is granted or not. The response includes the Transaction Reference ID and the result of the authorization process.

Finally, the USS invokes the UAV Re-authorization procedure to deliver the new pairing information to the UE (User Equipment). The USS includes the 3GPP UAV ID, the IP address of the PDU session, and the C2 Authorization Result and C2 Authorization Payload (containing the new UAV-C identifier and C2 security information) in the authorization message, which is further forwarded to the UE.

This detailed procedure ensures that the UAV can continue its operations with a new controller while maintaining the necessary security and QoS parameters.","The answer must include:

"Describe the U-TDOA positioning method for a UE in the CELL_FACH state, including the procedures and messages involved.","The U-TDOA (Uplink Time Difference of Arrival) positioning method for a User Equipment (UE) in the CELL_FACH state involves several steps and specific messages exchanged between the Serving Radio Network Controller (SRNC) and the Stand-Alone SMLC (SAS). The process begins with an authenticated request for positioning information about a UE from an application in the core network, which is received at the SRNC in a RANAP: Location Reporting Control message. This request can be for either on-demand or periodic reporting.

The SRNC invokes the U-TDOA positioning method by sending a PCAP: Position Calculation Request message to the SAS. This message contains the contents of the RANAP Location Reporting Control message, RF channel information, and Cell ID for the UE being positioned. Since the UE in the CELL_FACH state is sharing a common uplink channel and usually not sending data, the SRNC must force the UE to transmit. This is achieved by sending a RRC Radio Bearer Reconfiguration message that causes the UE to periodically send RLC Status PDUs to the SRNC for an Acknowledged Mode DCCH.

After sending the Position Calculation Request message, the SRNC executes a procedure to cause the UE to transmit a certain minimum number of pre-coded bits within a recommended maximum time interval of three seconds. The number of bits and actual time interval are related to the required location accuracy, propagation conditions in the serving cell, and the LMU configuration for the SAS. The SAS configures the U-TDOA capable LMUs, analyzes the returned information, and calculates the UE position and optionally, velocity.

The SAS returns the UE position and optionally, velocity to the SRNC in a PCAP: Position Calculation Response message. The SRNC then returns the UE position and optionally, the velocity to the core network in a RANAP: Location Report message. If periodic reporting was requested, the steps may be repeated until the desired amount of reports has been attained, or the procedure is cancelled by UTRAN or the core network.

In summary, the U-TDOA positioning method for a UE in the CELL_FACH state involves the following key steps:
1. Initial request for positioning information from the core network to the SRNC.
2. SRNC's invocation of the U-TDOA positioning method using the Position Calculation Request message.
3. Procedure for causing the UE to transmit pre-coded bits, including the use of RRC Radio Bearer Reconfiguration message and periodic sending of RLC Status PDUs.
4. SAS's role in configuring U-TDOA capable LMUs, analyzing measurements, and calculating the UE position.

"Describe the procedures and criteria for Radio Link Failure and Restoration in 3GPP specifications, including the relevant causes and indications.","The procedures and criteria for Radio Link Failure and Restoration in 3GPP specifications are detailed in various documents. 

For Radio Link Failure, the procedure is outlined in TS 25.423 subclause 8.3.9.2.

The Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF) and the IMS Media Gateway (IM-MGW) may support transcoding to and from the EVS speech codec. If they do, the procedures specified in clause 9.2.13.2 of 3GPP TS 29.163 apply. When the MGCF sends an SDP offer for an EVS payload type, it must handle the EVS codec parameters as described in Table 9.2.13.2.1 of TS 29.163. Similarly, when the MGCF receives an SDP offer containing an EVS codec payload type, it must handle the EVS codec parameters as described in Table 9.2.13.2.2 of TS 29.163.

Describe the conditions and actions related to the DCH_ENHANCEMENTS_STATUS variable in the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331.,"The DCH_ENHANCEMENTS_STATUS variable in the UE is set to TRUE only when the following conditions are met: the UE is in CELL_DCH state, the UE supports DCH Enhancements, and the UE has stored the IE 'DCH Enhancements info FDD'. If any of these conditions are not met and the variable is set to TRUE, the UE must set the variable to FALSE and trigger the lower layers to stop operation with DCH Enhancements.

When the DCH_ENHANCEMENTS_STATUS variable is set to TRUE, the UE must check several configurations and conditions. If any of the specified conditions related to 'DL FET Mode', 'Power offset PTPC-DPDCH', 'Power offset POSRB', 'Number of bits for Pilot bits', 'HS_DSCH RECEPTION', 'E_DCH_TRANSMISSION', 'DTX_DRX_STATUS', and 'UL Transmission Mode' are not met, the UE must set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

"Describe the UE's ability to perform and report WLAN RSSI measurements under AWGN conditions for both E-UTRA FDD and TDD, including the specific events and measurement periods involved.","The UE's ability to perform and report WLAN RSSI measurements under AWGN conditions for both E-UTRA FDD and TDD involves several key aspects:

1. **Purpose of the Tests**:
   - For E-UTRA FDD, the tests aim to verify the UE's ability to correctly detect event W1 (WLAN becomes better than a threshold) for unknown neighbour APs and event W3 (All WLAN inside WLAN mobility set becomes worse than a threshold) for known serving APs. These events are defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 and the requirements are stated in clause 8.25.1.3.
   - For E-UTRA TDD, the tests similarly aim to verify the UE's ability to detect event W1 and event W3 under AWGN conditions, with the requirements stated in clause 8.25.2.3.

2. **Measurement Periods (TWLAN_RSSI)**:
   - In the RRC_CONNECTED state without DRX, the measurement period for WLAN RSSI (TWLAN_RSSI) is defined in Tables 8.25.1.3-1 and 8.25.2.3-1 for E-UTRA FDD and TDD respectively.
   - The value of TWLAN_RSSI depends on whether the WLAN RSSI measurement is performed on the serving AP or on a neighbour AP. For neighbour APs, it further depends on whether the AP is known or unknown to the UE.
     - Measurement of known single neighbour APs is time-sensitive and performed on APs for which the operating channel information is known to the UE.
     - Measurement of unknown neighbour APs is not time-sensitive and performed on APs for which the operating channel information is not known to the UE.
   - The UE must be capable of performing WLAN RSSI measurements for a minimum number of APs during TWLAN_RSSI, provided that the beacon frame of the measured AP is available at the UE at least once every 102.4 ms. The UE physical layer must be capable of reporting WLAN RSSI measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of TWLAN_RSSI.

3. **Accuracy Requirements**:
   - The WLAN RSSI measurement accuracy for all measured access points must meet the performance requirements specified in clause 5.1.16.

4. **Normative References**:
   - The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 8.1.2.4.19 and A.8.25.1 for E-UTRA FDD, and clauses 8.1.2.4.20 and A.8.25.2 for E-UTRA TDD.

1. **MME, S-GW, LI LCS Client, and HSS**:
   - The functional requirements for LI in the MME, S-GW, LI LCS Client, and HSS do not differ from those applicable to GTP-based S5-S8 interfaces. Interception in these nodes is based on parameters such as NAI, MSISDN, and IMEI.
   - The correlation number, which is unique within the entire PLMN, is used to correlate Communication Content (CC) with Intercept Related Information (IRI) and different IRIs of one IP-CAN session. This number is generated using existing parameters related to the IP-CAN session.
   - If interception is activated for both parties of the Packet Data communication, both CC and IRI shall be delivered for each party as separate intercept activities.

2. **PDN-GW**:
   - Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option. The PDN-GW provides correlation numbers and target identities to DF2 and DF3, which are used to select the different Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) where the product shall be delivered.
   - The PDN-GW is subjected to the requirements specified in clause 12.2 or 12.3, depending on the protocol used over the S5/S8 interface.

   - Communication Content (CC) shall also be reported when received over S4/S12 interfaces. The network procedures for generating applicable events for the S-GW connected over S4/S12 interfaces to a SGSN are defined in TS 23.060.

Describe the improvements and benefits of the Back to Back Dynamic Allocation (B2DA) scheme in GERAN Evolution as outlined in the 3GPP TS 45.912 document.,"The Back to Back Dynamic Allocation (B2DA) scheme in GERAN Evolution is designed to enhance resource allocation by dynamically growing assigned uplink timeslots and reducing mutual blocking during burst packet data flows. B2DA assigns USF (Uplink State Flag) values to mobile stations equal to the number of assigned uplink PDCHs (Packet Data Channels), concentrating these values on the lowest numbered timeslot. This approach, however, reduces multiplexing flexibility as more than one USF value may be needed by one mobile on the lowest numbered timeslot.

To improve this, a proposal aims to enhance the multiplexing flexibility of B2DA by using fewer USF values without impacting the efficient resource allocation. The improvement reduces the number of USF values needed on the lowest numbered assigned PDCH, thereby increasing the statistical multiplexing efficiency when multiple mobile stations require dynamically allocated uplink resources simultaneously. This allocation can coexist with extended dynamic allocation (EDA), offering performance gains compared to homogenous allocations using only EDA.

However, the proposed allocation has limitations in certain situations, such as the inability to allocate three uplink PDCHs in specific instances. Despite this, it allows the BSS (Base Station Subsystem) to use B2DA in scenarios where USF resources are limited. The usage of USF-timeslot resources is increased compared to other dynamic allocation schemes, which require only N exclusive USF resources, by a factor of 100%. Overall, the improvements to B2DA enhance resource allocation efficiency and flexibility in GERAN Evolution.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose of the B2DA scheme in enhancing resource allocation in GERAN Evolution.
  - How B2DA assigns USF values and the impact on multiplexing flexibility.
  - The proposed improvements to B2DA to reduce the number of USF values needed and increase statistical multiplexing efficiency.
  - The coexistence of the proposed allocation with extended dynamic allocation and the specific scenarios where the proposed allocation is beneficial or limited."
Describe the QUIC connection establishment and proxying mechanisms between the UE and UPF as defined in 3GPP TS 23.700.,"The QUIC connection establishment and proxying mechanisms between the User Equipment (UE) and the User Plane Function (UPF) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.700 involve several key procedures and solutions:

1. **Establishment of QUIC Connections**:
   - The UE and UPF establish QUIC connections, which can be encrypted or use NULL encryption. For NULL encryption, two solutions are proposed: extending TLS 1.3 to support NULL encryption or making the TLS layer optional for the QUIC protocol.
   - If radio level security is enabled, the use of NULL encrypted QUIC connections is proposed.
   - QUIC functionality information, including security details (e.g., Pre-Shared Key as defined by IETF TLS 1.3), QUIC version information, and transport parameters, can be sent to the UE via user plane or NAS message during the MA PDU establishment procedure to achieve 0-RTT QUIC connection establishment.

2. **Transparent QUIC Solution**:
   - In the transparent solution, the UE encapsulates packets with the destination IP address of the remote server, and the UPF removes the QUIC header before forwarding the packets using UDP.
   - The UP protocol stack for the transparent solution is based on UDP protocol, and there is no impact on QoS control as the original IP/UDP header is used.

3. **Non-Transparent QUIC Solution**:
   - Similar to the MPTCP solution in Rel-16, the network sends QUIC proxy information (IP address and port number) to the UE. The UE uses this information to encapsulate user data, and the UPF replaces it with the remote server IP address upon receiving the uplink packet.
   - The MASQUE protocol is used to transport the IP address of the remote server to the UPF.
   - The UP protocol stack for the non-transparent solution includes an additional IP/UDP header replacement operation, where the UE replaces the original IP address and UDP port with the QUIC proxy IP address/UDP port, and the UPF replaces it back to the server IP address/UDP port.

4. **Proxying Mechanisms**:
   - The UE requests proxying of UDP packets and notifies the UPF about the QoS Flow – QUIC Connection association via a QUIC Connection of the MA PDU Session user plane.
   - The procedure involves the UE sending an HTTP Request with proxy information (destination address and port) or QoS Flow Identifier (QFI) to the UPF, which sets up the appropriate proxying state and replies with a Datagram-Flow-Id if proxying was requested.
   - User data is then carried between the UE and UPF via the QUIC Connection and proxied by the UPF.

These mechanisms ensure efficient and secure communication between the UE and UPF, leveraging QUIC protocol capabilities for improved performance and flexibility.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The establishment of QUIC connections between the UE and UPF, including the use of NULL encryption and the role of TLS 1.3.
2. The procedures for sending QUIC functionality information to the UE, either via user plane or NAS message.
3. The non-transparent QUIC solution, including the use of the MASQUE protocol and the replacement of IP/UDP headers.
4. The procedure for the UE to request proxying of UDP packets and notify the UPF about QoS Flow – QUIC Connection association, including the steps involved in the signalling process."
"Describe the procedures and data structures involved in the EVS codec rate control on the Iu interface, including the roles of the MGW and RNC.","The EVS codec rate control on the Iu interface involves several procedures and data structures, with key roles played by the Media Gateway (MGW) and the Radio Network Controller (RNC). 

Firstly, the data structures exchanged on the Iu interface are symmetrical, meaning the structure of the uplink data frames is identical to that of the downlink data frames. This symmetry ensures consistency in data handling across the interface.

The EVS Codec Mode Request (EVS-CMR) in the downlink direction (DL EVS CMR) is part of the Iu PDU Type 0 payload. It follows immediately after the Speech or SID payload bits and is mapped into the selected EVS Configuration for Iu. The DL EVS CMR is crucial for controlling the codec mode and is not subject to the PDU Type 14 Rate Control Procedure in the downlink direction.

The EVS codec rate in the downlink direction is controlled by two complementing procedures. The Iu-terminating MGW hosts the Transcoder (TC), which includes the EVS Encoder and Decoder. Each uplink PDU Type 0 received by the MGW contains the uplink EVS CMR (UL EVS CMR) sent by the User Equipment (UE). Additionally, uplink PDU Type 14 may contain an uplink Rate Control Procedure (UL RC Proc), specifying the maximum bit rate allowed by the RNC for subsequent speech frames.

The MGW combines the UL EVS CMR with the maximum rate allowed by the UL RC Proc, resulting in an internal UL EVS CMR (UL EVS CMR i). This combination ensures that the codec rate does not exceed the RNC's maximum rate for downlink. The MGW may further filter and modify the UL EVS CMR i based on operator policy and remembers the resulting value until it is modified again.

In the downlink direction, the EVS Decoder within the MGW generates a DL EVS CMR i, defining the maximum EVS mode it wants to receive in uplink. If the MGW operates in TrFO mode (without a transcoder), the remembered UL EVS CMR i is sent to the outgoing interface, potentially mapped to the outgoing EVS Configuration.

The MGW maps each received DL EVS CMR (Nb) into the EVS Configuration for Iu before sending it towards the RNC. Similarly, it maps each received UL EVS CMR (Iu) into the EVS Configuration for Nb before sending it to the next MGW. These mappings ensure compatibility and proper rate control across different configurations.

Overall, the MGW and RNC play critical roles in managing the EVS codec rate, ensuring efficient and consistent data transmission on the Iu interface.","The answer should cover the symmetrical nature of data structures on the Iu interface, the placement and role of EVS-CMR in the Iu PDU Type 0 payload, the procedures for controlling the EVS codec rate in downlink direction, including the combination of UL EVS CMR and UL RC Proc by the MGW, and the handling of EVS configurations in TrFO mode. It should also mention the roles of the MGW and RNC in these processes."
What are the minimum conformance requirements for timing advance adjustments in E-UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The minimum conformance requirements for timing advance adjustments in E-UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 include several key points:

1. **Initiation of Timing Advance**: The timing advance is initiated from E-UTRAN using a MAC message, which implies an adjustment of the timing advance according to 3GPP TS 36.321 clause 5.2.

2. **Adjustment of Uplink Transmission Timing**: The UE (User Equipment) shall adjust the timing of its uplink transmission at sub-frame n+6 for a timing advancement command received in sub-frame n. The adjustment must be made with a relative accuracy better than or equal to ±4 ×TS seconds to the signaled timing advance value compared to the timing of the preceding uplink transmission.

3. **Expression of Timing Advance Command**: The timing advance command is expressed in multiples of 16 × TS.

NTA is defined in 3GPP TS 36.211.

4. **Adjustment of NTA Values**: In other cases, a 6-bit timing advance command (TA) indicates the adjustment of the current NTA value (NTA,old) to the new NTA value (NTA,new) by index values of TA = 0, 1, 2,..., 63, where NTA,new = NTA,old + (TA - 31) × 16 according to 3GPP TS 36.213 clause 4.2.3. Adjustment of the NTA value by a positive or negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing by a given amount, respectively.

5. **UE Timer Accuracy Requirements**: The UE shall comply with the timer accuracies according to 3GPP TS 36.133 table 7.2.2-1. These requirements are related to the actual timing measurements internally in the UE.

6. **Normative References**: The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.3.2.2 and A.7.2.10.

"Describe the operation and requirements of UE test loop mode B in standalone NR mode as specified in TS 38.509, including any relevant exceptions and comparisons to previous specifications.","UE test loop mode B in standalone NR mode, as specified in TS 38.509, involves the loopback of SDAP SDUs for bi-directional QoS Flows. This mode requires the establishment of at least one 5GS test mode bi-directional QoS Flow between the SS and UE before closing the loop and requesting the UE to start looping back the received data packets. The downlink SDAP SDUs or IP PDUs received by the UE on all bi-directional QoS Flows are returned without any modification of the IP header to the UL QoS flow descriptions handling SAP for transmission in uplink.

"Describe the key features and requirements of the 5G system as outlined in the 3GPP documents, focusing on network slicing, KPIs, and support for various services.","The 5G system, as outlined in the 3GPP documents, is designed to provide optimized support for a variety of different services, traffic loads, and end user communities. Unlike previous systems, 5G introduces new technologies that allow for flexible and scalable assignment of network resources.

What are the key requirements for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of the UE based on uplink signal measurements as specified in TS 38.533 10.3.1 and TS 38.533 10.3.1.1?,"The key requirements for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of the User Equipment (UE) based on uplink signal measurements are outlined in TS 38.533 10.3.1 and TS 38.533 10.3.1.1.

Explain the rules for arming and disarming Detection Points (DPs) in CAMEL call processing as specified in 3GPP TS 23.078.,"In CAMEL call processing, Detection Points (DPs) can be armed either statically or dynamically. Static arming occurs under specific conditions in different network elements. For mobile terminating call handling, DPs are statically armed in the Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) due to T-CSI delivery from the Home Location Register (HLR) and in the Visited Mobile Switching Center (VMSC) due to VT-CSI delivery from the Visitor Location Register (VLR). For forwarding leg handling, DPs are statically armed in the GMSC as a result of O-CSI and/or D-CSI delivery from the HLR, and for mobile originating call or forwarded leg handling, DPs are statically armed in the VMSC due to O-CSI and/or D-CSI delivery from the VLR. Dynamic arming is performed by the gsmSCF within the context of a CAMEL control relationship between the gsmSSF and the gsmSCF.

Disarming of DPs follows specific rules. A statically armed DP is disarmed when the corresponding CSI (O-CSI, D-CSI, T-CSI, or VT-CSI) is withdrawn in the HLR, applicable only to TDP-Rs. An armed EDP is disarmed when it is met, and if an EDP causes the release of the related leg, all EDPs related to that leg are disarmed. Additionally, if a call is released, all EDPs related to that call are disarmed. Implicit disarming occurs according to predefined rules, and an EDP can be explicitly disarmed by the gsmSCF using the Request Report BCSM Event information flow.

Implicit disarming rules are specified for Originating and Terminating BCSM. When an EDP-R is encountered, implicit disarming takes place before reporting the EDP and transitioning the gsmSSF to the Waiting_For_Instruction state. The tables in the specification detail which DPs are implicitly disarmed when each EDP is encountered, marked by 'X'. It is possible to rearm an implicitly disarmed DP explicitly, for example, for follow-on calls.

During DP processing, the gsmSSF ensures a single point of control by disarming EDPs as they are encountered and reported to the gsmSCF, when another EDP causes implicit disarming, or when the leg clears. A control relationship persists as long as one or more EDP-R is armed or if the Process CS_gsmSSF is in any state except Monitoring or Idle. If the control relationship does not persist, it changes to a monitor relationship if certain conditions are met, such as the arming of EDP-Ns or outstanding reports. If neither a control nor monitor relationship persists, the relationship terminates.

For trunk originating calls, the TO-CSI identifies services offered by the serving PLMN operator for all incoming calls on a specific MSC trunk and is stored in the MSC. The TO-CSI informs the MSC to request instructions from the gsmSSF, enabling the gsmSSF to control the call execution. Static arming of DPs for trunk originating calls occurs as a result of TO-CSI for the specific MSC trunk, and disarming occurs when the TO-CSI is withdrawn from the MSC. Criteria for TDP may be defined based on dialed digits, basic service, call type, or other information at the network operator's discretion.","The answer must include a detailed explanation of the static and dynamic arming rules for DPs, including specific conditions for arming in GMSC, VMSC, and MSC for trunk originating calls. It should cover the implicit disarming rules for Originating and Terminating BCSM, including the conditions under which implicit disarming occurs and the possibility of rearming. The answer should also explain the DP processing rules by gsmSSF, including the persistence and transition of control relationships, and the termination conditions for both control and monitor relationships. Additionally, the role of TO-CSI in trunk originating calls and the criteria for TDP should be mentioned."
Describe the process and information flow involved in unsubscribing from location area monitoring as per 3GPP TS 23.434 specifications.,"The process of unsubscribing from location area monitoring involves a series of interactions between the VAL server and the location management server. The VAL server initiates the process by sending an unsubscribe request to the location management server. This request includes specific information as outlined in Table 9.3.2.19-1, which details the necessary data for the location area monitoring unsubscribe request.

Upon receiving the request, the location management server processes it and responds with an unsubscribe response. This response contains information specified in Table 9.3.2.20-1, indicating the status of the subscription and whether the unsubscribe request has been successfully processed.

The high-level procedure for this unsubscribe request is illustrated in Figure 9.3.12.3-1. The procedure involves the following steps:
1. The VAL server sends a location area monitoring unsubscribe request to the location management server, including the information specified in Table 9.3.2.19-1.
2. The location management server replies with a location area monitoring unsubscribe response, including the information specified in Table 9.3.2.20-1.

Additionally, the API operation for Unsubscribe_Location_Area_Monitoring is described in subclause 9.4.7.5. This API operation is used by the VAL server to unsubscribe from location area monitoring. The inputs required for this operation are detailed in subclause 9.3.2.19, and the outputs are detailed in subclause 9.3.2.20. For a comprehensive understanding of the usage of this API operation, subclause 9.3.12.3 provides further details.

In summary, the process involves the VAL server sending a detailed unsubscribe request, the location management server responding with the status of the request, and the use of a specific API operation to facilitate this interaction.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The role of the VAL server and the location management server in the unsubscribe process.
  - The specific information that needs to be included in the unsubscribe request from the VAL server (as per Table 9.3.2.19-1).
  - The specific information that needs to be included in the unsubscribe response from the location management server (as per Table 9.3.2.20-1).
  - The high-level procedure of the unsubscribe request, including the steps and the flow of messages between the VAL server and the location management server (as illustrated in Figure 9.3.12.3-1).

Compare and contrast the transport format structures for different transport channel types as defined in TS 25.302 sections 7.1.6 and 7.1.7.,"The transport format structures for different transport channel types as defined in TS 25.302 sections 7.1.6 and 7.1.7 have distinct components and attributes.

Section 7.1.6 defines the transport format for transport channel types other than HS-DSCH and E-DCH. This format consists of two parts: a dynamic part and a semi-static part. The dynamic part includes attributes such as Transport Block Size, Transport Block Set Size, and optionally, Transmission Time Interval for TDD. The semi-static part includes attributes such as Transmission Time Interval (mandatory for FDD, optional for TDD NRT bearers), error protection scheme (type of error protection, coding rate, static rate matching parameter), and size of CRC. An example of this transport format structure is given as: Dynamic part: {320 bits, 640 bits}, Semi-static part: {10ms, convolutional coding only, static rate matching parameter = 1}. Additionally, an empty Transport Format is defined as having a Block Set Size equal to zero.

Section 7.1.7 defines the transport format for E-DCH channels, which consists of three parts: a dynamic part, a semi-static part, and a static part. The dynamic part includes attributes such as Transport block size (same as Transport block set size) and Redundancy version. The semi-static part includes the Transmission Time Interval, with different intervals supported for FDD and TDD. The static part includes the error protection scheme (turbo coding), coding rate (1/3), and size of CRC (24 bits). Unlike the transport format in section 7.1.6, the transport format for E-DCH is always explicitly signalled, with no support for blind transport format detection.

In summary, the transport format for non-HS-DSCH/non-E-DCH channels has two parts (dynamic and semi-static), while the transport format for E-DCH channels has three parts (dynamic, semi-static, and static). The attributes of each part differ, with the E-DCH format requiring explicit signalling and having specific error protection and coding rate attributes.","The answer must include:
  - A clear comparison of the transport format structures for non-HS-DSCH/non-E-DCH channels and E-DCH channels.
  - Identification of the components (dynamic, semi-static, static) in each transport format.
  - Detailed attributes of each component for both types of transport formats.
  - Explanation of the explicit signalling requirement for E-DCH transport format.
  - Examples to illustrate the differences in transport format structures."
Describe the process and information flow involved in obtaining a VAL user profile as per 3GPP TS 23.434 specifications.,"The process of obtaining a VAL user profile as per 3GPP TS 23.434 involves several steps and information flows between the configuration management client and server. 

Firstly, the 'Get VAL user profile request' is initiated by the configuration management client and sent to the configuration management server. This information flow is detailed in Table 11.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.434, which outlines the specific data and parameters included in the request.

Once the server receives the request, it processes it and generates a 'Get VAL user profile response'. This response is then sent back to the configuration management client, as described in Table 11.3.2.4-1 of TS 23.434. The response contains the requested user profile information.

The API operation associated with this process is named 'Obtain_User_Profile'. According to TS 23.434 subclause 11.4.2.2, this operation is used for obtaining user profiles and is primarily consumed by the VAL server. The inputs required for this API operation are specified in subclause 11.3.2.3, while the outputs are detailed in subclause 11.3.2.4.

Additionally, subclause 11.3.4.2 provides further details on the usage of the 'Obtain_User_Profile' API operation, ensuring that the process is clearly understood and correctly implemented.","The answer should include a clear description of the 'Get VAL user profile request' and 'Get VAL user profile response' information flows, as outlined in Tables 11.3.2.3-1 and 11.3.2.4-1 respectively. It should also explain the API operation 'Obtain_User_Profile', including its purpose, known consumers (VAL server), and reference the relevant subclauses (11.3.2.3 for inputs and 11.3.2.4 for outputs). Additionally, it should mention the detailed usage of this API operation as described in subclause 11.3.4.2."
Describe the conformance requirements for UE measurements and reporting delays for secondary component carriers as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The conformance requirements for UE measurements and reporting delays for secondary component carriers as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 include several key aspects:

1. **Cell Detectability Conditions**: A cell is considered detectable when the RSRP-related conditions specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.15 are fulfilled for the corresponding band. Additionally, the SCH_RP|dBm and SCH Ês/Iot conditions according to Annex I.2.10 must be met.

2. **Measurement Periods and Accuracy**: The measurement period for deactivated secondary component carrier (SCC) measurements is defined as Tmeasure_scc_CRS, which is based on the parameter measCycleSCell. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements for three identified cells on a secondary component carrier and report these measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of Tmeasure_scc_CRS. The measurement accuracy for all measured cells must comply with the specifications in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.15.

3. **Event-Triggered Measurement Reporting Delays**: The event-triggered measurement reporting delay is the time between an event that triggers a measurement report and the point when the UE starts transmitting the report over the air interface. This delay should be less than Tidentify_scc_CRS as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.7.2.4.1, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling on the DCCH or lack of UL resources. When L3 filtering is used or IDC autonomous denial is configured, additional delays can be expected. If a cell becomes undetectable for a period of ≤ 5 seconds and then becomes detectable again, triggering an event, the reporting delay should be less than Tmeasure_scc_CRS, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than 50 Ts and L3 filtering has not been used.

4. **Normative References**: The normative references for these requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.8, 8.7.2.4.1, and 9.1.15, as well as A.8.22.9 and A.8.22.10.

These requirements ensure that the UE can accurately and timely report measurements for secondary component carriers, maintaining the performance and reliability of the network.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The conditions under which a cell is considered detectable.
  - The measurement periods and accuracy requirements for UE measurements on secondary component carriers.
  - The requirements for event-triggered measurement reporting delays, including the impact of L3 filtering and IDC autonomous denial.
  - The normative references for these requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 7.8, 8.7.2.4.1, and 9.1.15."
Describe the structure and components of the URI used in the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service according to 3GPP specifications.,"The Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service uses the Nudm_SSAU API, and its URI structure is defined as follows: {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>. The components of this URI are:

- {apiRoot}: This is a concatenation of several parts:
  - scheme: Either 'http' or 'https'. Both are allowed, but security considerations for using 'https' are detailed in 3GPP TS 33.501.
  - the fixed string '://'
  - authority: This includes the host and optional port, represented by the operator-specific Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Examples of FQDN can be found in 3GPP TS 23.003.
  - an optional deployment-specific string (API prefix) that starts with a '/' character.

- <apiName>: This defines the name of the API. For the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service, the apiName is 'nudm-ssau'.

- <apiVersion>: This indicates the major version of the API. For the Nudm_SSAU API, the apiVersion is 'v1'.

- <apiSpecificResourceUriPart>: This part is defined in clause 6.8.3 of 3GPP TS 29.503, which provides specific details on the resource URI part for the Nudm_SSAU API.

An example of the complete API URI for the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service could be: 'https://operator-specific-fqdn/nudm-ssau/v1/resource-specific-part'. This structure ensures that each resource is uniquely identified and follows the recommended design archetypes for 5GC SBI APIs.","The answer should include the complete structure of the URI for the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service, specifying the values for apiRoot, apiName, apiVersion, and apiSpecificResourceUriPart.

Describe the conditions under which the reference sensitivity performance must be met according to 3GPP TS 45.056.,"The reference sensitivity performance must be met under several specific conditions as outlined in 3GPP TS 45.056:

1. **In-band and Out-of-band Performance (Document 1)**:
   - A useful signal at frequency fo, 3 dB above the reference sensitivity level.
   - A continuous, static sine wave signal at a level specified in the table and at a frequency (f) which is an integer multiple of 200 kHz.
   - Spurious response frequencies exceptions: 
     - GSM 900: In-band, for a maximum of six occurrences.
     - DCS 1800: In-band, for a maximum of twelve occurrences.
     - Out-of-band, for a maximum of 24 occurrences.
   - The sine wave signal (f) should be set to a level of 70 dBµV (emf) (-43 dBm).

2. **Reference Sensitivity Performance Metrics (Document 2)**:
   - Performance is measured in terms of frame erasure, bit error, or residual bit error rates.
   - The actual sensitivity level is the input level for which this performance is met and must be less than the reference sensitivity level.
   - Exceptions for CTS-FP: If the received level on either of the two adjacent timeslots to the wanted exceeds the wanted timeslot by more than 20 dB.

3. **Interfering Signal Conditions (Document 3)**:
   - A useful signal at fo, 3 dB above the reference sensitivity level.
   - A single frequency (f) in the relevant receive band, | f-fo | > 6 MHz, which is an integer multiple of 200 kHz.
   - A GSM TDMA signal modulated by any 148-bit sequence of the 511-bit pseudo-random bit sequence, with one timeslot active and the frequency at least 2 channels separated from any identified spurious response.
   - Transmitted bursts synchronized but delayed in time between 61 and 86 bit periods relative to the wanted signal.

4. **Specific Frequency Relationships (Document 4)**:
   - A useful signal at frequency fo, 3 dB above the reference sensitivity level.
   - A continuous, static sine wave signal at frequency f1 and a level of 64 dBµV (emf) (-49 dBm).

   - The relationship f0 = 2f1 - f2 and |f2-f1 | = 800 kHz must be maintained.

These conditions ensure that the receiver's reference sensitivity performance is robust and reliable under various signal and interference scenarios.","The answer should include the conditions for in-band and out-of-band performance, the levels and types of signals involved, exceptions to the signal levels, propagation conditions, and specific frequency relationships. It should also cover the modulation requirements and synchronization details for the interfering signals."
What are the requirements and recommendations for MTSI MGWs in inter-working scenarios as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114?,"The requirements and recommendations for MTSI MGWs in inter-working scenarios as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 cover several key aspects:

1. **Scope of Requirements for PS Side of MGW (TS 26.114 12.3)**: This clause focuses on the PS side of the MGW, specifically for the PS session between the MTSI client in a terminal and the MGW. It does not cover the CS side of the MGW, which is between the MGW and the CS terminal. The requirements apply to MTSI MGWs supporting inter-working between a CS terminal using CS GERAN/UTRAN access or an MTSI client in terminal performing SRVCC to CS and an MTSI client using 3GPP access, fixed access, or a non-MTSI client. The procedures are harmonized to enable the same processes regardless of the type of PS client and its access method, as long as it uses IP-based access. The goal is to enable tandem-free operation when the same codec (AMR or AMR-WB) is used by both endpoints.

2. **Additional Codecs for Inter-working (TS 26.114 18.2.2)**: An MTSI MGW may support other codecs listed in clause 18.2.2 for inter-working between an MTSI client using fixed access and a CS terminal using GERAN or UTRAN access. In such cases, tandem coding will be used, and the PS side and CS side operate independently. The requirements and recommendations for the PS side of the MGW are the same as for an MTSI client using fixed access unless explicitly defined otherwise.

3. **IMS and MTSI Services Inter-working with Other IP Networks (TS 26.114 12.7.1)**: IMS and MTSI services must support inter-working with similar services on other IP networks, both IMS-based and non-IMS-based. Operators have the option to provide transcoding when end-to-end codec negotiation fails. The requirements apply to MTSI MGWs when transcoding is provided, designed for sessions carried with IP end-to-end, possibly interconnected through other IP networks. The requirements aim to harmonize inter-working with GERAN/UTRAN CS inter-working defined in clause 12.3. However, there is a major difference: clause 12.3 applies only to the PS side of the MTSI MGW, while clause 12.7.1 includes requirements for both the PS access towards the remote network and the local MTSI client in the terminal.

Overall, the requirements and recommendations ensure seamless inter-working between different types of terminals and access methods, focusing on harmonized procedures and codec compatibility to facilitate efficient communication.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The scope of the requirements for the PS side of the MGW as defined in TS 26.114 12.3.
  - The inter-working scenarios involving CS terminals and MTSI clients, including the types of access (3GPP, fixed, non-MTSI).
  - The harmonization of procedures for different PS clients and the goal of tandem-free operation with codecs like AMR and AMR-WB.
  - The additional codecs supported for inter-working between MTSI clients using fixed access and CS terminals using GERAN or UTRAN access as mentioned in TS 26.114 18.2.2.
  - The requirements for IMS and MTSI services inter-working with other IP networks, including the option for operators to provide transcoding and the harmonization with GERAN/UTRAN CS inter-working as described in TS 26.114 12.7.1.
  - The specific requirements for the PS access towards remote networks and any additional requirements targeting both the local MTSI client and the remote network."
Describe the process and key elements involved in the initiation and termination of a conversation using MBMS subchannels in the MCPTT function.,"The initiation of a conversation using MBMS subchannels in the MCPTT function involves the participating MCPTT function deciding to use an MBMS subchannel for media plane control messages and media packets. To establish this, the participating MCPTT function sends a Map Group To Bearer message over the MCPTT-9 reference point. This message indicates the association information between the group identity of the call and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, along with additional parameters necessary for identifying the MBMS subchannel. Upon receiving this message over the general purpose MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCPTT client associates the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for audio, and floor control with the MCPTT group identity.

The termination of a conversation involves the participating MCPTT function sending an Unmap Group To Bearer message. This message terminates the association between the MBMS subchannel used for the conversation and the group identity. When the MBMS interface in the MCPTT client receives this message over the MBMS subchannel, it removes the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for audio, and floor control from the conversation in the group session identified by the MCPTT Group ID field, if such an association exists.

These processes are detailed in clauses 10.3.2 and 10.3.4 of the relevant specifications.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the initiation process using MBMS subchannel, including the Map Group To Bearer message and its role in associating group identity with TMGI and necessary parameters.

Describe the supervisory and link control functions of S and U frames in 3GPP TS 24.250.,"In 3GPP TS 24.250, S frames and U frames serve distinct purposes for supervisory and link control functions. 

S frames are used to perform supervisory control functions, such as acknowledging I frames. Each S frame contains supervisory function bits S(n), which are used to encode commands and responses for supervisory control. Additionally, S frames include a receive sequence number N(R) and an acknowledgement request bit A, which can be set to 0 or 1. In acknowledged operation, all I and S frames contain R(n), the Selective Acknowledgement bitmap. The specific commands and responses for supervisory control are defined in subclause 5.4, while the detailed use of S(n), N(R), A, and R(n) is outlined in clause 6.

U frames, on the other hand, provide additional link control functions. Each U frame has Unnumbered function bits M(n) that encode link control commands and responses. U frames also include a Command/Response bit (C/R) to identify the frame as either a command or a response. Unlike S frames, U frames do not contain a sequence number. The commands and responses related to link control functions are also defined in subclause 5.4, and the detailed use of M(n) is specified in clause 6.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The purpose and functions of S frames, including the elements S(n), N(R), A, and R(n).

The frequencies to be tested are specified in Annex E table E-1 and TS 36.508 clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1, with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. The SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise source are connected to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 36.508 Annex A figures A.20 and A.78a, depending on the UE's RF band capabilities. General test parameters are set according to Table 5.1.58.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are defined in Annex B clause B.0. The connection setup involves two E-UTRA carriers, one E-UTRA TDD Cell 1, and one E-UTRA FDD Cell 2 on each carrier, with Cell 1 used for connection setup and power levels set according to Annex C.0 and C.1.

Message contents for the test are based on TS 36.508 clause 4.6 with specific exceptions listed in tables 5.1.58.4.3-1 to 5.1.58.4.3-12, which include various configurations and results required for the handover test.

The test requirements define handover delays Dhandover1 and Dhandover2. Dhandover1 is the time from the beginning of time period T3 to the moment the UE starts transmitting the PRACH to Cell 2, expressed as Dhandover1 = TRRC_procedure + TIU + 20 ms, and must be less than 50 ms.

"Describe the trust relationship determination process for accessing the EPC via different non-3GPP IP access networks, and explain the communication security measures involved.","The trust relationship determination process for accessing the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via different non-3GPP IP access networks involves distinguishing between trusted and untrusted networks. 

For a trusted non-3GPP IP access network, the communication between the User Equipment (UE) and the EPC is secure, with all communication transferred over pre-established secure links. In contrast, for an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network, the communication is not inherently secure, and additional measures are required to ensure security. Specifically, for untrusted networks:
- A single IPSec tunnel needs to be established to the evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) for all Packet Data Network (PDN) connections when the UE accesses EPC via S2a.
- An IPSec tunnel needs to be established with the same ePDG for each PDN connection when the UE accesses EPC via S2b.

The UE plays a crucial role in determining the trust relationship for access to the EPC via specific non-3GPP IP access networks. For instance:
- When accessing the EPC via a cdma2000® HRPD access network, the UE determines the trust relationship as described in clause 4.1.
- Similarly, when accessing the EPC via a WiMAX access network, the UE determines the trust relationship as described in clause 4.1.

Additionally, the EAP-3GPP-LimitedService method involves EAP requests and responses as specified in IETF RFC 3748 clause 4.1, using coding of the expanded method type as described in IETF RFC 3748 clause 5.7. The sending entity sets the value of a spare bit to zero, while the receiving entity ignores the value of the spare bit.","The answer must include:

Describe the conditions under which the Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover procedure is triggered and outline the UE and HA procedures as specified in the relevant documents.,"The Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover procedure is triggered under two main conditions: if the User Equipment (UE) local IP address has been reassigned, or if the UE moves from one link to another link. When the UE detects that its local IP address or the NAT UDP port number, or both, have been reassigned, it must update the mobility tunnel with the Home Agent (HA) by initiating the Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover.

The UE procedure for the Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover is detailed in subclause 5.2 of the relevant document. Upon detection of reassignment, the UE initiates the handover process to ensure continuous connectivity and proper routing of data packets.

Similarly, the HA procedure for the Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover is also specified in subclause 5.2 of the same document. The HA must manage the mobility tunnel updates and ensure that the handover process is completed efficiently to maintain seamless service for the UE.

Describe the RF requirements and co-location considerations for multi-band and single-band connectors and RIBs in IAB-DU and IAB-MT.,"The RF requirements for multi-band and single-band connectors in IAB-DU and IAB-MT are specified separately for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For single-band connectors, requirements such as spurious emissions, unwanted emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation, and receiver spurious emissions apply to the connector mapped to a single band. If the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements are tested separately with all other antenna connectors terminated.

IAB-DU or IAB-MT type 1-H can support multiple operating bands with various configurations of TAB connectors, including all single-band connectors, sets of single-band connectors supporting different bands, sets of single-band connectors supporting multiple bands, all multi-band connectors, or a combination of single-band and multi-band connectors. Requirements specified for an operating band apply only to the set of TAB connectors supporting that band. The specification does not cover cases where an operating band is supported by both multi-band and single-band connectors or by multi-band connectors not supporting the same band combination.

IAB-DU or IAB-MT type 1-O can support multiple operating bands with configurations at the radiated interface boundary, including all single-band RIBs, all multi-band RIBs, or a combination of single-band and multi-band RIBs. For multi-band connectors and RIBs supporting TDD bands, the RF requirements assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

Co-location considerations include spurious emissions limits for protection of other BS, IAB-DU, or IAB-MT receivers when co-located with systems like GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, and NR BS. The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with the same class. Exclusions and conditions for multi-band connectors apply for each supported operating band. Special co-location requirements may apply for overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, which are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

The power sum of spurious emissions for co-location with other receivers is specified over all supported polarizations at the output(s) of the co-location reference antenna and must not exceed the basic limits plus specific dB values for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.

"Describe the process and requirements for creating, updating, and deleting a Traffic Influence Subscription in the NEF.","To create, update, and delete a Traffic Influence Subscription in the Network Exposure Function (NEF), the Application Function (AF) uses HTTP requests as specified in the 3GPP TS 29.522.

1. **Creating a Traffic Influence Subscription:**
   - The AF sends an HTTP POST message to the NEF to the resource 'Traffic Influence Subscription'.
   - The body of the HTTP POST message may include various parameters such as AF Service Identifier, external Group Identifier, UE Indication, UE address, GPSI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Application Identifier, traffic filtering information, Subscribed Event, Notification destination address, geographic areas, AF Transaction Identifier, DNAI(s), routing profile ID(s), N6 traffic routing information, application relocation possibility, type of notifications, Temporal validity conditions, URLLC feature support, AF acknowledgement indication, UE IP address preservation, user plane latency requirements, simultaneous connectivity indication, minimum time interval for inactivity, EAS rediscovery indication, EAS IP replacement information, and event reporting requirements.
   - If the request is identified by UE address, the NEF interacts with the BSF and PCF to retrieve necessary information and create the resource.
   - If the request is not identified by UE address, the NEF interacts with the UDM and UDR to retrieve and store necessary information and create the resource.
   - Upon successful creation, the NEF responds with a 201 Created status code and includes a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource.

2. **Updating a Traffic Influence Subscription:**
   - The AF sends an HTTP PUT or PATCH message to the NEF to the resource 'Individual Traffic Influence Subscription' to change the traffic influence parameters.
   - The NEF updates the resource and responds with a 200 OK status code with the modified subscription representation or a 204 No Content response.

3. **Deleting a Traffic Influence Subscription:**
   - The AF sends an HTTP DELETE message to the NEF to the resource 'Individual Traffic Influence Subscription'.
   - The NEF deletes the corresponding active resource and responds with a 204 No Content status code.

**Handling Requests Identified by UE Address:**
   - The NEF interacts with the BSF to retrieve PCF information and then with the PCF to authorize policies.
   - If successful, the NEF creates, updates, or deletes the resource accordingly and responds with appropriate status codes.
   - If an error occurs, the NEF responds with a proper error status code and relays any application errors to the AF.

**Handling Requests Not Identified by UE Address:**
   - The NEF interacts with the UDM to retrieve SUPI or Internal Group Identifier and with the UDR to store traffic influence parameters.
   - If successful, the NEF creates, updates, or deletes the resource accordingly and responds with appropriate status codes.
   - If an error occurs, the NEF responds with a proper error status code and relays any application errors to the AF.

Describe the process and key considerations for IPv6 address configuration in a PDP context as per 3GPP specifications.,"The process of IPv6 address configuration in a PDP context as per 3GPP specifications involves several key steps and considerations:

1. **IPv6 Prefix Identification and Interface-Identifier Assignment**: The IPv6 prefix of a PDP context activated by means of the IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration Procedure is uniquely identified by the prefix part of the IPv6 address. The Mobile Station (MS) may select any value for the Interface-Identifier part of the address, except for the link-local address, which is assigned by the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) to avoid conflicts.

2. **Router Advertisement Process**: After the GGSN sends a Create PDP Context Response message to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), it starts sending Router Advertisements periodically on the new MS-GGSN link. The MS may issue a Router Solicitation to trigger an immediate Router Advertisement. The GGSN leaves the M-flag cleared to indicate stateless address autoconfiguration and may set the O-flag if additional configuration parameters are needed. The Prefix in the Router Advertisements must match the Prefix returned in the Create PDP Context Response, with the A-flag set and the L-flag cleared.

3. **IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration Procedure**: The MS uses the Interface-Identifier provided by the GGSN to create its IPv6 Link-Local Unicast Address. To communicate with other hosts, the MS must obtain an IPv6 Global or Site-Local Unicast Address through the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration procedure. The MS may use the Interface-Identifier received during PDP Context Activation or generate a new one.

4. **Duplicate Address Detection**: Since the GGSN guarantees the uniqueness of the Prefix, the MS does not need to perform Duplicate Address Detection on addresses it creates. The 'DupAddrDetectTransmits' variable in the MS should be set to zero.

5. **DHCP Session Initiation for Additional Configuration Parameters**: If the O-flag is set in the Router Advertisement, the MS may start a DHCP session to retrieve additional configuration parameters. If the MS is not DHCP capable, the O-flag may be ignored.

6. **Optional Assignment of Network Prefixes Shorter than /64**: A single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix may be assigned to a PDN connection. The /64 default prefix used for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration will be allocated from this network prefix, and the remaining address space can be delegated using prefix delegation.

7. **PLMN Based and External PDN Based IPv6 Prefix Allocation**: When PLMN based parameter configuration is used, the GGSN/PDN Gateway provides the requested IPv6 prefix from a locally provisioned pool. When external PDN based IPv6 prefix allocation is used, the GGSN/PDN Gateway may obtain the prefix from the external PDN.

These steps ensure that the MS can configure its IPv6 address properly and communicate effectively within the network.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - Explanation of how the IPv6 prefix is identified and the role of the Interface-Identifier.
  - Description of the Router Advertisement process and its flags (M-flag, O-flag, A-flag, L-flag).
  - Steps involved in the IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration procedure.
  - Handling of Duplicate Address Detection and the significance of the 'DupAddrDetectTransmits' variable.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in how a service consumer learns the expected UE behaviour parameters from the NWDAF, including the types of analytics, target reporting, and the validity of these parameters.","The process of how a service consumer learns the expected UE behaviour parameters from the NWDAF involves several key elements. The NWDAF provides analytics results to service consumers, which can be network functions (NFs) like AMF or AF, or the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) system. The types of analytics that can be requested are 'UE Mobility' and 'UE Communication'. 

For the analytics request, the consumer must specify the target of analytics reporting, which can be a single UE identified by SUPI or a group of UEs identified by an Internal Group ID. In the case of untrusted AF, the target can be a GPSI or an External Group Identifier mapped to a SUPI or Internal Group Identifier in the 5GC. The request must also include the analytics target period, indicating the time period over which the statistics or predictions are needed. Optional filter information can be provided, such as Area of Interest (AOI), S-NSSAI, DNN, Application ID, and a list of analytics subsets. Additionally, the request can specify a maximum number of objects and, in the case of subscriptions, include a Notification Correlation Id and Notification Target Address.

The NWDAF reports the analytics results to the consumer as specified. For 'UE Communication' analytics, the results include communication statistics and predictions, which are detailed in tables. When the target is an individual UE, the NWDAF provides the communication result, including predicted communication time slots. For groups of UEs, the results address the group globally, indicating the proportion of UEs involved in a given communication at a specific time and duration.

The Expected UE Behaviour parameters characterize the foreseen behaviour of a UE or a group of UEs. These parameters are stored as part of the subscriber data and have an associated validity time, which indicates when they expire and should be deleted by the related NFs. The parameters are stored in UDM and retrieved by AMF and SMF for use in managing PDU sessions and SMS transmissions. Specific parameters like Expected UE Moving Trajectory and Scheduled Communication Type are used by AMF and SMF to optimize resource allocation and manage UE behaviour effectively.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The role of NWDAF in providing expected UE behaviour parameters.
  - Types of analytics (UE Mobility, UE Communication) and their respective reporting targets (single UE or group of UEs).
  - Required and optional information in the analytics request (e.g., target period, filter information).
  - How analytics results are reported and notified to the consumer.
  - Description and validity of Expected UE Behaviour parameters, including their storage, retrieval, and usage by AMF and SMF."
"How can an Application Function (AF) manage Data Reporting Provisioning Sessions using the NEF, including creation, retrieval, and deletion processes?","An Application Function (AF) can manage Data Reporting Provisioning Sessions using the Network Exposure Function (NEF) through the following processes:

1. **Creating a Data Reporting Provisioning Session**:
   - The AF sends a `Nnef_DataReportingProvisioning_Create` request to the NEF using the HTTP POST method.
   - The request targets the 'Data Reporting Provisioning Sessions' collection resource and includes the `DataReportingProvisioningSession` data structure in the request body.
   - Upon receiving the request, the NEF interacts with the Data Collection and Analytics Function (DCAF) and creates a new 'Individual Data Reporting Provisioning Session' resource.
   - The NEF responds with an HTTP `200 OK` status code, including an HTTP Location header field with the URI of the created resource and a representation of the created resource in the response body.

2. **Retrieving an Existing Data Reporting Provisioning Session**:
   - The AF sends a `Nnef_DataReportingProvisioning_Retrieve` request to the NEF using the HTTP GET method.
   - The request targets the specific 'Individual Data Reporting Provisioning Session' resource.
   - Upon receiving the request, the NEF interacts with the DCAF and responds with an HTTP `200 OK` status code, including a representation of the requested resource in the response body.

3. **Deleting an Existing Data Reporting Provisioning Session**:
   - The AF sends a `Nnef_DataReportingProvisioning_Delete` request to the NEF using the HTTP DELETE method.
   - The request targets the specific 'Individual Data Reporting Provisioning Session' resource and supports URI query parameters as specified.
   - Upon receiving the request, the NEF interacts with the DCAF, deletes the corresponding resource, and responds with an HTTP `204 No Content` status code.

These processes ensure that the AF can effectively manage Data Reporting Provisioning Sessions by creating, retrieving, and deleting them as needed, with the NEF handling the necessary interactions with the DCAF.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The process for creating a Data Reporting Provisioning Session using the HTTP POST method, including the required data structure and the expected response.

"Describe the process and requirements for subscribing to CAPIF events, including the structure of the resource URIs and the supported data structures and response codes.","To subscribe to CAPIF events, the Subscriber must send an HTTP POST message to the CAPIF core function. The body of this message should include the Subscriber's Identifier, Event Type, and a Notification Destination URI. If the Enhanced_event_report feature is supported, the Subscriber may also include an event report requirement in the 'eventReq' attribute, specifying the event notification method (periodic, one time, on event detection), maximum number of reports, monitoring duration, repetition period for periodic reporting, and immediate reporting indication. Additionally, the Subscriber may include an event filter in the 'eventFilters' attribute, detailing API IDs, API invoker IDs, AEF identifiers, and/or API identifications based on the event type.

Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the CAPIF core function will verify the identity of the Subscriber and check if they are authorized to subscribe to the specified CAPIF events. If authorized, the CAPIF core function will create a new resource and return the CAPIF Resource URI in the response message.

Describe the procedures and conditions for testing repeaters under extreme power supply conditions and measuring power at various channel offsets as specified in 3GPP TS 25.143 and TS 36.143.,"The procedures and conditions for testing repeaters under extreme power supply conditions and measuring power at various channel offsets are detailed in 3GPP TS 25.143 and TS 36.143. 

For extreme power supply conditions, as specified in TS 25.143 5.4.4, the equipment must be tested at the upper and lower voltage limits declared by the manufacturer. The tests should be conducted at the steady state minimum and maximum temperature limits, following the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2 Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

The steps for testing repeaters under these conditions are outlined in TS 25.143 6.1.4.2:
1. Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with a combination of PCCPCH, SCCPCH, and Dedicated Physical Channels as specified in test model 1 of TS 25.141.
2. Adjust the input power to the repeater to achieve the maximum nominal output power at maximum gain.
3. Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.
4. Increase the power by 10 dB compared to the level obtained in step 2.
5. Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.

"What are the radiated performance requirements for OTA AAS BS in single RAT UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR operations as specified in 3GPP TS 37.145?","The radiated performance requirements for Over-The-Air Active Antenna System Base Stations (OTA AAS BS) in single Radio Access Technology (RAT) operations for UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR are specified in 3GPP TS 37.145. 

For single RAT UTRA operation, the requirements are detailed in clause 8.3.1. These include specifications for fixed reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions defined in TS 25.104 annex A and B. The requirements apply to single carrier operations and are defined in terms of Eb/N0, which is the ratio of the received total energy per PN chip per demodulation branch to the total one-sided noise power spectral density. Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) measurements must follow the general rules for statistical testing as defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 and TS 25.141 annex C. Performance targets are summarized in Table 8.3.1-1.

For single RAT E-UTRA operation, the requirements are specified in clause 8.4.1. These include specifications for FRCs and propagation conditions defined in TS 36.104 annex A and B. The requirements apply to single carrier operations and are defined in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). SNR is the ratio of the total signal energy in the subframe to the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the duration of a subframe. SINR is the ratio of the total signal energy in the subframe to the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers plus the white noise energy in the same bandwidth. Performance targets are defined based on these ratios.

For single RAT NR operation, the requirements are specified in clause 8.5. These requirements follow similar principles as those for UTRA and E-UTRA, focusing on radiated demodulation performance.

Additionally, TS 25.141 clause 8.6 provides guidelines for verification tests and internal BLER calculation requirements, which are applicable to the performance testing of OTA AAS BS in these single RAT operations.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the structure and rules for constructing M2AP messages as defined in TS 36.443, particularly focusing on the ASN.1 definitions and the precedence rules between ASN.1 and tabular formats.","The structure and rules for constructing M2AP messages as defined in TS 36.443 are detailed through the ASN.1 definitions and tabular formats. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of M2AP messages, which can contain any Information Elements (IEs) specified in the object set definitions for that message without restrictions on order or number of occurrences. However, for the current version of the standard, a sending entity must construct an M2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and adhere to the following additional rules:

1. **Ordering of IEs**: IEs must be ordered in an IE container in the order they appear in the object set definitions.
2. **Presence Conditions**: An IE must appear exactly once if its presence field in an object has the value “mandatory”. An IE may appear at most once if its presence field has the value “optional” or “conditional”. If a tabular format specifies multiplicity for an IE (i.e., an IE list), the corresponding ASN.1 definition separates the list into two parts: the IE container list and the list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own and may contain only one kind of list elements.
3. **Precedence Rules**: In case of contradiction between the ASN.1 definition and the tabular format in sub clauses 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 definition takes precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format takes precedence.
4. **Handling Abstract Syntax Errors**: If an M2AP message is received that is not constructed as defined above, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error. The message must be handled according to the procedures defined for Abstract Syntax Errors in clause 10.

These rules ensure that M2AP messages are constructed consistently and correctly, facilitating reliable communication within the protocol.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - The structure and content of M2AP messages as defined by ASN.1.
  - The precedence rules between ASN.1 definitions and tabular formats.
  - The ordering and presence conditions for IEs in M2AP messages.
  - The handling of IE containers and lists.
  - The procedure for handling Abstract Syntax Errors."
"Describe the user plane protocol stack for W-5GAN for 5G-RG and how it relates to the protocol stack defined for 5G-RG connected via NG-RAN, including the key elements and functionalities supported by W-UP.","The user plane protocol stack for W-5GAN for 5G-RG is defined in TS 23.316. This stack outlines the communication between the 5G-RG (Residential Gateway) and the UPF (User Plane Function). The W-UP (Wireless User Plane) protocol stack supports at least one W-UP resource per PDU session, which is the default resource. It may also support multiple W-UP resources per PDU session, allowing different QoS profiles (QFIs) to be associated with different resources. The W-UP protocol stack facilitates the transmission of uplink and downlink PDUs and supports access-specific QoS parameters that can be mapped from 3GPP QoS parameters received from the 5GC (5G Core).

For the 5G-RG connected via NG-RAN (Next Generation Radio Access Network), the protocol stack defined in TS 23.501 clause 8.3.1 applies, with the 5G-RG replacing the UE (User Equipment). This stack includes several layers:
- The PDU layer, which corresponds to the PDU carried between the UE and the DN (Data Network) over the PDU session. Depending on the PDU session type, it can carry IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets, Ethernet frames, etc.
- The GTP-U (GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane), which supports tunnelling user data over N3 (between the 5G-AN node and the UPF) and N9 (between different UPFs of the 5GC) in the backbone network. GTP-U encapsulates all end-user PDUs and provides encapsulation on a per PDU session level.
- The 5G-AN protocol stack, which depends on the type of access network. For 3GPP NG-RAN, these protocols are defined in TS 38.401, TS 36.300, and TS 38.300. For untrusted non-3GPP access, the 5G-AN interfaces with the 5GC at an N3IWF, and the protocol stack is defined in clause 8.3.2.
- UDP/IP, which are backbone network protocols.

The protocol stack for 5G-RG connected via NG-RAN also includes considerations for the number of UPFs in the data path, the optional nature of non-PDU session anchor UPFs, and the potential for intra-PLMN or inter-PLMN N9 interfaces. Additionally, if there is an UL CL (Uplink Classifier) or a Branching Point in the data path of a PDU session, these elements act as non-PDU session anchor UPFs, leading to multiple N9 interfaces branching out to different PDU session anchors.

For further details, refer to the relevant 3GPP documents: TS 23.316 for the W-5GAN protocol stack and TS 23.501 clause 8.3.1 for the NG-RAN protocol stack.","The answer should include a description of the user plane protocol stack between 5G-RG and UPF as defined in TS 23.316, highlighting the W-UP protocol stack's support for multiple resources per PDU session and access specific QoS parameters. It should also explain the protocol stack for 5G-RG connected via NG-RAN as per TS 23.501 clause 8.3.1, detailing the PDU layer, GTP-U, 5G-AN protocol stack, and backbone network protocols. Additionally, the answer should cover the transmission of uplink and downlink PDUs and reference the relevant 3GPP documents for further details."
What are the key elements and rules for handling Abstract Syntax Errors in S1AP messages as specified in TS 36.413?,"The key elements and rules for handling Abstract Syntax Errors in S1AP messages as specified in TS 36.413 include several important aspects:

1. **Notations for Procedures, Messages, IEs, and Values of IEs**:
   - Procedures are referred to with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word 'procedure' (e.g., E-RAB procedure).
   - Messages are referred to with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word 'message' (e.g., MESSAGE NAME message).
   - Information Elements (IEs) are referred to with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation 'IE' (e.g., Information Element IE).
   - Values of IEs are enclosed by quotation marks (e.g., 'Value').

2. **S1AP IE Definitions and Precedence Rules**:
   - S1AP IE definitions are presented in tabular format in subclause 9.2, with corresponding ASN.1 definitions in subclause 9.3.
   - In case of contradiction between the tabular format and ASN.1 definitions, ASN.1 takes precedence except for the conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format takes precedence.

3. **Rules for Constructing S1AP Messages**:
   - IEs must be ordered in the order they appear in object set definitions.
   - An IE must appear exactly once if its presence is mandatory, and at most once if its presence is optional or conditional.
   - If an IE list is specified, it is separated into an IE container list and list elements in ASN.1 definitions.

4. **Conditions Leading to Abstract Syntax Errors**:
   - Receiving IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID).
   - Receiving IEs for which the logical range is violated.
   - Missing IEs or IE groups that should have been present.
   - Receiving IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences.
   - Receiving IEs or IE groups that should not have been present according to conditional presence.
   - Receiving IEs or IE groups for unsupported functionalities.

5. **Actions for Handling Abstract Syntax Errors**:
   - If a message initiating a procedure contains errors, the procedure is rejected, and the cause value 'Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)' is reported.
   - If a response message contains errors, the procedure is considered unsuccessfully terminated, and local error handling is initiated.
   - The receiver reads the remaining message and acts according to Criticality Information and Presence Information for the detected errors.

These rules ensure that S1AP messages are constructed and handled correctly, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the communication protocol.","The answer should include the following key details:
- Explanation of notations for procedures, messages, IEs, and values of IEs.
- Description of S1AP IE definitions and precedence rules between tabular format and ASN.1 definitions.

- Specific actions to be taken when Abstract Syntax Errors occur, including rejection of procedures, initiation of Error Indication procedures, and local error handling.
- Handling of Abstract Syntax Errors based on Criticality Information and Presence Information."
Describe the process of decoding and reconstructing the excitation signal in TC mode.,"In TC mode, the process begins with decoding the TC frame configuration. The adaptive excitation signal can be one of three types: a zero vector, a glottal-shape codevector, or an adaptive codebook vector. If the glottal-shape codebook is used in a subframe, the glottal-shape codevector is reconstructed using the received TC parameters. If the adaptive codebook is used, the adaptive codevector is found according to the specified method. After the subframe where the glottal-shape codebook is used, low-pass filtering is applied to the adaptive excitation signal. If a subframe contains a zero adaptive excitation vector, only the algebraic codebook gain is decoded using a scalar quantizer. Otherwise, both the adaptive and algebraic codebook gains are decoded. Finally, the reconstructed excitation signal is computed.","The answer must include the initial step of decoding the TC frame configuration, the types of adaptive excitation signals used, the process of reconstructing the glottal-shape codevector, the method of finding the adaptive codevector, the application of low-pass filtering, the decoding of algebraic codebook gain, and the final computation of the reconstructed excitation signal."

What are the procedures and requirements for handling CRS media in terminating UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.183?,"The procedures and requirements for handling CRS media in terminating UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.183 are as follows:

1. **Fetching and Playing CRS Media from URL**:
   - If the terminating UE supports the download and play model and an initial INVITE request contains an Alert-Info header field including a URI followed by a URN 'urn:alert:service:crs', the UE shall fetch and play the CRS media from the URL contained in the Alert-Info header field in the INVITE request (TS 24.183 4.5.5.2.2.1).

2. **Handling Initial INVITE Request with URN 'urn:alert:service:crs'**:

Describe the functionalities and interactions of the Location Management Function (LMF) within the 5G Core Network (5GCN) as defined in 3GPP specifications.,"The Location Management Function (LMF) within the 5G Core Network (5GCN) is responsible for coordinating and scheduling resources required for locating a User Equipment (UE) that is registered with or accessing the 5GCN. The LMF calculates or verifies the final location and velocity estimate of the UE and may estimate the achieved accuracy. It receives location requests for a target UE from the serving Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) using the Nlmf interface and interacts with the UE to exchange location information applicable to UE-assisted and UE-based positioning methods. Additionally, the LMF interacts with the Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN), Non-3GPP Interworking Function (N3IWF), or Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) to obtain location information.

The LMF determines the positioning results in geographical coordinates as defined in 3GPP specifications and/or in local coordinates. If requested and available, the positioning result may also include the velocity of the UE. The coordinate type is determined by the LMF based on the Location Services (LCS) Client type and supported Geographical Area Description (GAD) shapes. For regulatory LCS Client types, the LMF determines a geographical location and optionally a location in local coordinates. For value-added LCS Client types, the LMF may determine the UE location in local or geographical coordinates or both.

The LMF supports various functions, including:
- Handling single, periodic, or triggered location requests from the serving AMF for a target UE.
- Reporting UE location estimates directly to a Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC) for periodic or triggered location of a target UE.
- Supporting the provision of broadcast assistance data to UEs via NG-RAN in ciphered or unciphered form and forwarding any ciphering keys to subscribed UEs via the AMF.
- Supporting the change of a serving LMF for periodic or triggered location reporting for a target UE.
- Mapping the UE location to a geographical area where the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is or is not allowed to operate based on the request from AMF.
- Determining a UE location at a scheduled location time.

The LMF also supports obtaining downlink and uplink location measurements from the UE and NG-RAN, respectively, and obtaining non-UE associated assistance data from the NG-RAN. The reference model for the LMF in service-based interface and reference point representation is provided in the 3GPP specifications.

For additional functions and detailed descriptions, the LMF's functionality is further defined in clause 4.3.8 of 3GPP TS 23.273.","Key details the answer must include:

Describe the procedures for applying the U-TDOA location method in different initial conditions of the MS as per 3GPP TS 43.059.,"The procedures for applying the U-TDOA location method in different initial conditions of the Mobile Station (MS) as per 3GPP TS 43.059 are as follows:

1. **Initial Conditions of the MS**:
   - **Packet Idle Mode**: When the MS is initially in packet idle mode, the Packet Polling method is applied.
   - **Packet Transfer Mode**: When the MS is initially in packet transfer mode, it may or may not be sending uplink data. If the MS is not sending uplink data, the Packet Polling procedure is applied.

2. **Procedures in Packet Idle Mode**:
   - A single timeslot downlink Temporary Block Flow (TBF) is established.
   - This downlink TBF is used for repeated executions of the Packet Polling procedure to cause the MS to transmit for a sufficient time to achieve the requested level of location accuracy.
   - The number of repetitions required to achieve the desired accuracy is indicated in the U-TDOA REQUEST message sent from the Serving Mobile Location Center (SMLC) to the Base Station Subsystem (BSS).
   - The BSS executes the indicated number of Packet Polling procedures after an implementation-dependent interval to allow assignment of the Location Measurement Units (LMU) to the indicated Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN) and timeslot(s).
   - If the MS is allocated an uplink TBF before completing the required Packet Polling procedures, the BSS may suspend the Packet Polling procedure and send a Reset message to the SMLC containing the physical channel information for the allocated uplink TBF.

3. **Procedures in Packet Transfer Mode**:
   - **Downlink TBF**: If only a downlink TBF exists, it is used to execute the Packet Polling procedure on the lowest numbered timeslot transmitted before the last PACKET POLLING REQUEST/PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT cycle is completed. The TBF is terminated after the last cycle using a PACKET TBF RELEASE message from the BSS.
   - **Uplink TBF**: If only an uplink TBF exists and RLC/MAC blocks are available for transmission, those blocks are used to locate the MS using the U-TDOA location method. If the number of uplink blocks is insufficient, the Packet Polling procedure is executed on the existing uplink TBF for the balance of the requested blocks.
   - **Both Uplink and Downlink TBFs**: If both exist, either TBF may be used for MS location using the U-TDOA location method. The TBF should not be terminated until the Packet Polling procedures are completed.

In summary, the application of the U-TDOA location method varies based on the initial condition of the MS, with specific procedures for packet idle mode and packet transfer mode, including handling of downlink TBF, uplink TBF, and both TBFs, as well as conditions for termination and suspension of the Packet Polling procedure.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The initial conditions of the MS (packet idle mode and packet transfer mode).
  - The procedures to be applied in packet idle mode (Packet Polling method).
  - The procedures to be applied in packet transfer mode, including handling of downlink TBF, uplink TBF, and both TBFs.
  - Specific steps for executing Packet polling procedure, including the use of timeslots, termination conditions, and suspension conditions.
  - Handling of uplink TBF allocation during the U-TDOA location method in packet idle mode."
Explain the structure and usage of SUPI and GCI in 5G and FN-CRG subscriptions as defined in 3GPP specifications.,"In 5G and FN-CRG subscriptions, the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) and Global Cable Identifier (GCI) play crucial roles in subscriber identification and network connectivity.

The SUPI for FN-CRG and 5G-CRG subscriptions can be configured by the operator to contain either an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or a GCI. The IMSI is described in detail in TS 23.501, while the GCI is defined in TS 23.316. For 5G-CRG subscriptions, only those whose SUPI corresponds to an IMSI can use 3GPP access to connect to the 5G Core (5GC). When the SUPI contains a GCI, it takes the form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI), where the user part is the GCI and the realm part is an identifier of the operator managing the subscription.

The Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is used to conceal the SUPI when provided to the network. For 5G-CRG, the SUCI contains the concealed SUPI, while for FN-CRG, the SUCI always corresponds to a SUPI containing a GCI. The SUCI acts as a pseudonym for the SUPI, and the User Data Management (UDM) performs a mapping to the SUPI, which may contain either an IMSI or the same GCI as in the SUCI, depending on operator configuration. The SUCI also includes an identifier of the home network, which is the operator managing the subscription.

The GCI is specified for usage with the 5GC to define a globally unique identifier for the line connecting the Cable Residential Gateway (CRG) to the network. It includes components such as the HFC_Identifier, defined in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH, and the HFC Node ID, which is used to build User Location Information on Cable access. The GCI is administered by the W-AGF operator and is encoded as defined in TS 23.003 and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH.

In general, the SUPI in 5G systems is a globally unique identifier allocated to each subscriber and provisioned in the UDM/UDR. It may contain an IMSI, a network-specific identifier for private networks, a Global Line Identifier (GLI) and operator identifier for supporting FN-BRGs, or a GCI and operator identifier for supporting FN-CRGs and 5G-CRG. The SUPI containing a network-specific identifier takes the form of an NAI using RFC 7542 based user identification. For roaming scenarios, the SUPI includes the address of the home network, such as the MCC and MNC in the case of an IMSI-based SUPI. For interworking with the EPC, the SUPI allocated to the 3GPP UE is always based on an IMSI to enable the UE to present an IMSI to the EPC.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The structure of SUPI for FN-CRG and 5G-CRG subscriptions, including the options of IMSI and GCI.
- The role of SUCI in concealing SUPI and its components.
- The definition and components of GCI, including HFC_Identifier and HFC Node ID.
- The encoding of GCI and its administration by the W-AGF operator.
- The general structure of SUPI in 5G systems, including its possible contents and usage in roaming and interworking scenarios."
What are the key requirements for UE to access presence servers in 3GPP and 3GPP2 systems?,"To access presence servers in 3GPP systems, the User Equipment (UE) must meet several key requirements:

"Describe the structure and encoding of the TWAN Identifier as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274, including its key components and their encoding rules.","The TWAN Identifier is used for reporting the location of a User Equipment (UE) in a Trusted WLAN Access Network (TWAN). It is structured to include several key components, each with specific encoding rules.

1. **SSID**: The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is an Octet String with a maximum length of 32 octets. The length of the SSID field is indicated by the SSID Length in octet '6'.

2. **BSSID**: The BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is an Octet String that is 6 octets long. The presence of the BSSID is indicated by the BSSIDI flag in octet 5. If the BSSIDI flag is set to '1', the BSSID is included; if set to '0', it is not.

3. **Civic Address**: The Civic Address Information contains the civic address of the access point to which the UE is attached. Its presence is indicated by the CIVAI flag in octet 5. When present, it is encoded as defined in clause 3.1 of IETF RFC 4776, excluding the first 3 octets.

4. **PLMN-ID**: The TWAN PLMN-ID indicates the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID of the TWAN operator. Its presence is indicated by the PLMNI flag in octet 5. When present, it is encoded as octets 5 to 7 of the Serving Network IE.

The Relay Identity Type, Relay Identity Length, and Circuit-ID Length are encoded according to specific rules, with the Relay Identity Type indicating the type of Relay Identity (e.g., IP address or FQDN).

The TWAN Identifier plays a crucial role in reporting UE location information over S2a during PDN connection establishment, bearer creation/modification/release, and PDN connection release. It ensures that the Application Function (e.g., P-CSCF) can determine the Network Provided Location Information (NPLI) of the UE.

Additionally, the Serving Network IE includes the PLMN identity used for 3GPP-based access authentication provided by the TWAN, highlighting the relationship between the TWAN Identifier and Serving Network IE.

Subsystem numbers, as described in 3GPP TS 23.003, are used to identify applications within network entities, providing a broader context for understanding network identifiers and their importance in network operations.","The answer should cover the following key details:

Describe the procedure and criteria for testing the 'interarrival jitter' field in the receiver report sent from the SUT.,"The purpose of the test is to verify if the 'interarrival jitter' field in the receiver report sent from the System Under Test (SUT) is consistent with RTP packets sent by data injection. 

Preconditions for the test include:
1. The SUT must have passed tests 6.2.4.2, 6.2.4.4, and 6.2.6.1.
2. The SUT must be set to receive RTP packets during the test session, either pre-configured or set as send-receive or receive-only through test instrument signaling.
3. Data injection must be configured to send a single RTP stream (one SSRC) subjected to delay variations according to delay and loss profiles.

The detailed test procedure involves the following steps:
1. Observe the SUT and data injection output.
2. Retrieve RTP Time Stamp rate information from the SDP line used to set up the SUT session.
3. For each delay and loss profile, start data injection sending RTP packets subjected to delay variations.
4. Note the reception time and 'interarrival jitter' field in the report block of each RTCP packet sent from the SUT.
5. Count the number of RTCP packets sent from the SUT.
6. Count the number of RTP packets sent from data injection between each pair of subsequent RTCP packets sent from the SUT.
7. Note the reception time and 'timestamp' field of each RTP packet sent from data injection.
8. Calculate the arrival time in timestamp units of each RTP packet sent from data injection.
9. Calculate the difference in RTP packet spacing.
10. Calculate the filtered RTP packet jitter.
11. When there are no more delay and loss profile data to apply to RTP packets, stop sending RTP packets.

The stop condition involves ensuring that RTP packets are sent from data injection and at least one RTCP packet is sent from the SUT after the last RTP packet from data injection for each delay and loss profile.

The pass criteria require that the calculated jitter matches expected nominal values based on delay and loss profile content, excluding any data injection or test instrument implementation impact.

Comments indicate that the test result is independent of whether RTP packets are sent by the SUT or not.","The answer must include:
  - The purpose of the test, which is to verify the consistency of the 'interarrival jitter' field in the receiver report with RTP packets sent by data injection.

  - A step-by-step description of the test procedure, including observing the SUT, retrieving RTP Time Stamp rate information, starting data injection, noting reception times and 'interarrival jitter' fields, counting RTCP and RTP packets, calculating arrival times and differences in RTP packet spacing, and calculating filtered RTP packet jitter.
  - The stop condition, which involves sending RTP packets from data injection and ensuring at least one RTCP packet is sent from the SUT after the last RTP packet for each delay and loss profile.
  - The pass criteria, which require the calculated jitter to match expected nominal values based on delay and loss profile content.

"Describe the key elements and functionalities of the Key Server Function (KSF) and Security Termination Function (STF) in the context of 5G security frameworks, including their roles in encryption, key management, and lawful interception.","In the context of 5G security frameworks, the Key Server Function (KSF) and Security Termination Function (STF) play crucial roles in encryption, key management, and lawful interception.

The KSF is responsible for deriving cryptographic keys from the USIM or equivalent (such as eSIM) and providing these keys to various application functions. It is located at the home CSP and connected to the AAA infrastructure, typically the AUSF. The KSF uses the basic network layer authentication service (native 5G AKA or EAP-AKA’) to obtain a derived anchor key, from which it can derive one or more service-specific keys. These keys are then provided to application functions that include a Security Termination Function (STF) endpoint for securing communication with the UE. The KSF uses a 5G native identifier space for subscribers, such as SUPI, while the STF can use any identifier type to identify its users. The STF can be located in the HPLMN, VPLMN, or outside a PLMN, such as at an enterprise.

In the specific case of the Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) framework, the KSF corresponds to the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF), and the STF corresponds to the AKMA Application Function (AF), identified by an application identifier AKMA AF_ID. The AAnF derives application-dependent keys (KAF) from the anchor key (KAKMA) and provides them to the AF. The Anchor Key Identifier (A-KID) is used to identify the key KAKMA and is globally unique. The A-KID can be modified or invalidated through 5G primary authentication or specific AKMA Context Removal requests.

Regarding lawful interception (LI), the KSF and STF have specific roles in enabling the decryption of communication traffic. When encryption keys are provided by a CSP, LI can be performed by either decrypting intercepted communication traffic before delivering IRIs and CCs to the LEA or providing the decryption keys and necessary information to the LEA. LI functions are required at both the KSF and STF. For example, the STF can decrypt communication traffic independently if it has obtained the encryption key from the KSF. In other situations, the KSF may need to provide intercept triggers to the STF to identify target communication traffic. The physical and jurisdictional location of the KSF and STF can impact LI requirements, such as in roaming scenarios where the STF needs to be located in the VPLMN and use 5G native user identifiers for LI provisioning.

In summary, the KSF and STF are integral to 5G security frameworks, managing encryption and key derivation, and supporting lawful interception through their respective functions and interactions.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- Explanation of the KSF and STF roles in 5G security frameworks.

- The role of KSF and STF in lawful interception, including examples of how LI functions are implemented.
- The impact of physical/jurisdictional location of KSF and STF on LI requirements."
What are the key requirements for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of the UE based on uplink signal measurements as specified in TS 38.533?,"The key requirements for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of the UE based on uplink signal measurements as specified in TS 38.533 include the following criteria: 

1. **UE Output Power Thresholds**: 
   - If the UE output power is higher than the Transmit OFF power of -50 dBm (as defined in TS 38.101-1), it indicates the presence of an uplink signal.
   - If the UE output power is equal to or less than the Transmit OFF power of -50 dBm, it indicates the absence of an uplink signal.

2. **Measurement Methods**:
   - For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the Transmit OFF power is measured as the mean power per component carrier.
   - For UE with multiple transmit antennas, the Transmit OFF power is measured as the mean power at each transmit connector.

These requirements are normatively referenced in TS 38.133 clause A.11.4.1.1.","The answer should include the criteria for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of the UE based on uplink signal measurements, specifically the UE output power thresholds. It should also mention the measurement methods for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation and multiple transmit antennas, and reference the normative document TS 38.133 clause A.11.4.1.1."
"Describe the performance requirements for PUCCH format 2 with DTX as specified in TS 36.141, including the relevant subclauses and key metrics for evaluation.","The performance requirements for PUCCH format 2 with DTX are detailed in TS 36.141, specifically in subclause 8.3.9.1. These requirements apply to a base station (BS) that supports PUCCH format 2 with Discontinuous Transmission (DTX), although it is optional for a BS to support this format. A BS may choose to meet the PUCCH format 2 requirements specified in Clause 8.3.9 instead of the requirements specified in Clause 8.3.2 for single antenna port and Clause 8.3.8 for two antenna ports.

The performance of PUCCH format 2 for Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) is determined by the block error probability (BLER) of CQI. The CQI BLER is defined as the sum of the conditional probability of incorrectly decoding the CQI information when it is sent and the conditional probability of detecting UE transmission as DTX when the CQI information is sent. Additionally, the CQI false alarm probability is defined as the conditional probability of falsely detecting CQI information transmitted from the UE when no CQI information is sent.

The performance is measured by the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a CQI BLER of 1% and a CQI false alarm rate of 10%. Testing for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports that bandwidth. For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths, only the tests for the lowest and highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.","The answer must include the following key details:

"Describe the procedures for activating default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts in the MME, including the message flows, timer management, and EPS bearer identity assignment.","The procedures for activating default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts in the MME involve specific steps, message flows, timer management, and EPS bearer identity assignment.

For the default EPS bearer context activation procedure:
1. The MME initiates the procedure by sending an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and enters the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING.
2. If the default bearer is activated as part of the attach procedure, the MME sends the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message together with the ATTACH ACCEPT message and does not start the timer T3485.
3. If the default bearer is activated in response to a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME sends the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message alone and starts the timer T3485.
4. The MME assigns an EPS bearer identity in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, selecting a value as specified by clause 9.3.2.
5. The MME retrieves the PTI from the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and includes it in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
6. Both the network identifier part and the operator identifier part are included in the Access Point Name IE.

For the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure:
1. In WB-S1 mode, the MME initiates the procedure by sending an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, starts the timer T3485, and enters the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING.
2. The MME allocates the EPS bearer identity, selecting a value as specified by clause 9.3.2, and includes it in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

Regarding EPS bearer identity assignment:
- Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every EPS Session Management (ESM) message contain the EPS bearer identity.
- If the UE or the MME does not support signaling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts, the MME selects the EPS bearer identity from the value range 5 to 15, or selects the value 0 to indicate that no EPS bearer identity is assigned.
- When assigning EPS bearer identities from the range 1 to 4, the MME considers that these EPS bearer contexts will be subject to local deactivation if the UE performs inter-system changes to A/Gb mode or Iu mode or changes to an MME not supporting signaling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts.","The answer should cover the following key details:

What are the requirements for handover delay from E-UTRAN to HRPD as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The requirements for handover delay from E-UTRAN to HRPD as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 state that the handover delay Dhandover must be less than the maximum RRC procedure delay (50 ms) plus Tinterrupt in the RRC_CONNECTED state. When the UE receives an RRC message implying handover to HRPD, it must be ready to start transmission of the new reverse control channel in HRPD within Dhandover from the end of the last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC command. 

The interruption time is defined as the time between the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of the reverse control channel in HRPD, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known or unknown. An HRPD cell is considered known if it has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds; otherwise, it is unknown. 

Under the reference conditions specified, the interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt, which is calculated using the formula:
Tinterrupt = TIU + 40 + 10*KC*SWK + 10*OC*SWO ms

Where:
- TIU is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the E-UTRAN to the new HRPD cell, which can be up to one HRPD frame (26.66 ms).
- SWK is the number of HRPD chips indicated by the search window for known target HRPD cells in the message.
- SWO is the number of HRPD chips indicated by the search window for unknown target HRPD cells in the message.
- KC is the number of known target HRPD cells in the message.
- OC is the number of unknown target HRPD cells in the message.

Additionally, an extra delay in the interruption time may occur due to the reverse link silence interval, which is specific to HRPD.","The answer should include the requirement that the handover delay Dhandover must be less than the maximum RRC procedure delay (50 ms) plus Tinterrupt in RRC_CONNECTED state. It should explain that the UE must be ready to start transmission of the new reverse control channel in HRPD within Dhandover from the end of the last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC command.

"Describe the configuration and transmission process of the Relay Physical Downlink Control Channel (R-PDCCH) in LTE, including the differences between cross-interleaving and non-cross-interleaving methods.","The Relay Physical Downlink Control Channel (R-PDCCH) in LTE is configured and transmitted according to specific guidelines and methods. The R-PDCCH carries Downlink Control Information (DCI) for relay nodes and can be transmitted according to configuration 2 of Table 5.4-1 or configurations 0 or 1 of Table 5.4-2. In the frequency domain, a set of Virtual Resource Blocks (VRBs) is configured for potential R-PDCCH transmission by higher layers using resource allocation types 0, 1, or 2. For resource allocation type 2, the VRB to Physical Resource Block (PRB) mapping is configured by higher layers.

The R-PDCCH can be transmitted using two methods: cross-interleaving and non-cross-interleaving.

1. **Cross-Interleaving Method**:
   - In cross-interleaving, R-PDCCHs are multiplexed, scrambled, modulated, mapped to layers, precoded, and mapped to resource elements. An REG (Resource Element Group) is composed of 4 consecutively available REs (Resource Elements) in one OFDM symbol in a PRB configured for potential R-PDCCH transmission.
   - Certain REs are considered unavailable for mapping the R-PDCCH, such as those used for cell-specific reference signals, zero power or non-zero power CSI-RS, and UE-specific reference signals.
   - The downlink system bandwidth and time-domain index are determined based on the start and end symbol indices given in Table 5.4-1 and Table 5.4-2.

2. **Non-Cross-Interleaving Method**:
   - In non-cross-interleaving, the R-PDCCH is scrambled, modulated, mapped to layers, and precoded with the number of bits to be transmitted on the R-PDCCH being equal to one.
   - The R-PDCCH is transmitted on an aggregation of one or several PRBs. If the set of VRBs is configured by resource allocation type 2 with distributed VRB to PRB mapping, provisions for even slot numbers are applied.
   - The mapping to resource elements follows specific provisions, with certain resource elements reserved for reference signals.

The relay node monitors the set of configured VRBs in the first slot for a downlink assignment and in the second slot for an uplink grant. The R-PDCCH is demodulated based on cell-specific reference signals transmitted on one set of antenna ports or UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7, depending on the configuration by higher layers. If the relay node is configured to receive PDSCH data transmissions according to transmission mode 9, it may assume that REs for UE-specific reference signals are reserved in the first slot of VRB pairs used for R-PDCCH transmission.","The answer should include the following key points:
- Explanation of R-PDCCH configuration options (configurations 0, 1, and 2).

   - When there are transcoding functions in the bearer path, the performance provided by the MCPTT Service must be no more than 40 ms greater than the performance specified when there are no transcoding functions.

4. **KPIs for Terrestrial Use**:
   - The KPIs apply for terrestrial use only, including air-to-ground scenarios.
   - **Late Call Entry Time (KPI 4a)**: For calls without application layer encryption, the late call entry time must be less than 150 ms for 95% of all late call entry requests.
   - **Late Call Entry Time for Encrypted Calls (KPI 4b)**: For application layer encrypted calls, the late call entry time must be less than 350 ms for 95% of all late call entries. For encrypted calls interworking with non-3GPP PTT systems, the additional late call entry time must not exceed the difference in the encrypted and unencrypted late call entry times for the interworking system.

These KPIs ensure that all MCPTT users experience consistent performance regardless of call type, group size, user density, and whether the audio is transferred over unicast or multicast delivery.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The design requirements for MCPTT Service architecture and protocols to meet specified KPIs.
  - Detailed KPIs for MCPTT Service including MCPTT Access time, Mouth-to-ear latency, and conditions for group calls, private calls, and emergency calls.
  - KPIs for terrestrial use, including Late call entry times for encrypted and unencrypted calls.
  - Requirements for Late call entry times for encrypted calls interworking with non-3GPP PTT systems."
Explain the process of estimating the energy consumption of VNFCs based on vCPU usage as described in TS 28.554 and TS 28.310.,"The process of estimating the energy consumption of Virtual Network Function Components (VNFCs) based on vCPU usage involves several steps and key performance indicators (KPIs) as outlined in TS 28.554 and TS 28.310.

Firstly, the KPI ECVNFC,estimated is defined as an estimation of the energy consumption of a VNFC. This estimation is obtained by considering the energy consumption of the virtual compute resource instance on which the VNFC runs. The unit of this KPI is Joules (J). The energy consumption of the virtual compute resource instance is estimated based on its mean vCPU usage, as detailed in TS 28.310 clause 6.3.2.2.1.

Secondly, the KPI ECvirtualCompute,estimated,VCpuUsageMean provides an estimation of the energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance. This estimation is calculated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance runs. The proportion is determined by dividing the vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance by the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI node. The unit of this KPI is also Joules (J).

The detailed procedure for estimating the energy consumption of VNFCs based on vCPU usage involves the following steps:

1. The Management Function (MF) collects Power, Energy, and Environmental (PEE) measurements from NFVI nodes during a given period of time.
2. The MF subscribes to Performance Management (PM) notifications from the Virtual Network Function Manager (VNFM) to receive notifications about the vCPU mean usage of selected VNFC instances.
3. The MF requests the VNFM to create a PM job to collect the vCPU usage of selected VNFC instances.
4. The VNFM subscribes to PM notifications from the Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) to receive notifications about the vCPU usage of the virtual compute instances on which each VNFC instance runs.
5. The VNFM requests the VIM to create a PM job to collect the vCPU usage of the virtual compute instances.
6. The VIM collects process utilization compute metric values from all CPU cores of the NFVI at predefined intervals.
7. The VIM aggregates these values per virtual compute resource and calculates their arithmetic mean, referred to as VCpuUsageMean.
8. The VIM notifies the VNFM about the VCpuUsageMean measurements for the virtual compute instances.
9. The VNFM maps the received VCpuUsageMean measurements from virtual compute instances to the VNFC instances.
10. The VNFM generates the measurement for the VNFC instances by assigning the value of the multiple VCpuUsageMean measurements received.
11. The VNFM notifies the MF about the average VCpuUsageMean of each virtual compute instance used by the VNFC instances.
12. The energy consumption of the NF can now be estimated by summing the energy consumed by all its constituent VNFC instances. For each VNFC instance, its estimated energy consumption is a proportion of the NFVI node energy consumption on which it runs, based on the vCPU mean usage.

References to relevant ETSI GS NFV IFA documents are included throughout the procedure to ensure completeness and accuracy.","The answer must include the definition and calculation method of ECVNFC,estimated and ECvirtualCompute,estimated,VCpuUsageMean KPIs. It should detail the procedure for estimating energy consumption, including the roles of MF, VNFM, and VIM, and the steps involved in collecting and processing vCPU usage data.

Describe the criticality information handling in RUA messages as specified in 3GPP TS 25.468.,"In RUA messages, criticality information is set for individual Information Elements (IEs) and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver on how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended.

Explain the procedure for alternate speech/facsimile group 3 services during call setup as described in 3GPP TS 29.007.,"The procedure for alternate speech/facsimile group 3 services during call setup involves several steps and checks to ensure proper service invocation and compatibility. Initially, this service is invoked at the UE-MSC link during the call setup phase by indicating repeated bearer capability information elements in the setup message and/or call confirmed message. These elements are preceded by a repeat indicator 'circular,' with one indicating speech and the other indicating facsimile group 3. The facsimile service requested is indicated by the information transfer capability 'facsimile group 3,' similar to a normal single call.

The first indicated bearer capability, either speech or facsimile group 3, determines the initial selection required by the network. Depending on the type of service requested and the direction of call establishment (MO/MT), low layer and high layer capabilities may also be included. The MSC/IWF performs both compatibility checking and subscription checking on both sets of capabilities as it would for normal data calls. If either check fails, the call is rejected, except in cases where TS61/TS62 negotiation takes place.

During the 'speech' phase of the call, the transcoder handles the call using normal telephony teleservice interworking requirements and mobile network capabilities, including any necessary echo cancellers. The 'facsimile group 3' phase utilizes the appropriate data interworking capability (IWF including modem) and uses either the transparent mobile network capability in A/Gb mode or the non-transparent mobile network capability in UTRAN Iu mode.

For service and operational reasons, the network must provide a rapid and reliable changeover of capability upon request from the mobile user. This changeover may involve disabling, bypassing, or introducing specific network functions (e.g., speech coder, modem) and changing the channel configuration on the radio interface. The changeover is initiated upon receipt of the 'MODIFY' message from the UE, and the network itself does not initiate the changeover.

Finally, the call setup follows the normal procedure but includes the repeated bearer capability information elements as described in subclause 9.3.1.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The invocation of alternate speech/facsimile group 3 services during call setup.
  - The use of repeated bearer capability information elements in the setup and call confirmed messages.
  - The role of the MSC/IWF in performing compatibility and subscription checks.
  - The handling of the speech phase by the transcoder and the facsimile phase by the appropriate data interworking capability.
  - The process of capability changeover initiated by the 'MODIFY' message from the UE.
  - The confirmation that the call setup follows the normal procedure with the specified modifications."
"Describe the role and functionalities of the UAS Network Function (UAS-NF) in the 5G Core Network, including its interactions with other network functions and external systems.","The UAS Network Function (UAS-NF) plays a crucial role in the 5G Core Network by facilitating various services related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The primary functionalities of the UAS-NF include UAV authentication and authorization, flight authorization, UAV-UAVC pairing authorization, location reporting, presence monitoring, and control of Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic filtering for Command and Control (C2) communication. These functionalities ensure secure and efficient operation of UAVs within the network.

The UAS-NF coordinates with the Unmanned Aircraft System Service Supplier (USS) to assist in the assignment of CAA-Level UAV IDs, which is essential for regulatory compliance and tracking. Additionally, the UAS-NF stores information related to re-authentication, re-authorization, and revocation requests from the USS, including whether these requests are directed towards the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) or the Session Management Function (SMF)/SMF+PGW-C, along with the addresses of the serving AMF or SMF/SMF+PGW-C.

The Application Function (AF) within the USS utilizes the Naf_Authentication service, which is part of the Naf service-based interface, to interact with the NEF (UAS-NF). This interaction is crucial for the authentication processes required for UAV operations. The reference architecture for the Naf_Authentication service is provided in both service-based interface representation and reference point representation.

Furthermore, the NEF (UAS-NF) offers services to other network functions such as AMF, SMF, and Policy Control Function (PCF) via the Nnef service-based interface. It also provides services to SMF+PGW-C for UUAA-SM and C2 procedures supported in the Evolved Packet System (EPS).

   - Release all media plane resources corresponding to the MCData communication being released.
   - Note that partially received data can be stored and processed.

2. **From MCData Server**: If the SIP BYE request is received from the MCData server, the MCData client should follow the general procedure with an additional step:

"Describe the HTTP PATCH method as specified, including the media types, request body data types, error handling, and optional operations.","The HTTP PATCH method is used to create, update, or delete one or multiple resources.

Describe the procedures and operations supported by the TSN AF and TSCTSF for port management and user plane node management in a 5G system integrated with an IEEE TSN network.,"In a 5G system (5GS) integrated with an IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network, the device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) is deployed at the user equipment (UE)-side edge, and the network-side TSN translator (NW-TT) is deployed at the network-side edge. The TSN application function (TSN AF) is deployed to exchange user plane node information, such as TSN bridge information, with the centralized network configuration (CNC) as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc-2018. This user plane node information includes port management information and user plane node management information, with port management information related to ports located in the DS-TT and NW-TT, and user plane node management information related to the NW-TT.

To support the exchange of user plane node information between the TSN AF and CNC, the DS-TT, NW-TT, and TSN AF support procedures for port management and user plane node management. Clause 5 of the relevant technical specification describes the elementary procedures between the TSN AF and DS-TT for port management, while Clause 6 details the procedures between the TSN AF and NW-TT for port management (Clause 6.2) and user plane node management (Clause 6.3). The operations supported by the TSN AF for port management and user plane node management are listed in 3GPP TS 23.501, tables 5.28.3.1-1 and 5.28.3.1-2.

Additionally, a 5GS supports application function (AF)-requested time synchronization services. For this purpose, a Network Exposure Function (NEF) in the 5GS exposes 5GS capabilities to support these services. The Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) manages the user plane node and ports (either Ethernet ports or Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ports) in the DS-TT and NW-TT for time synchronization. Therefore, the DS-TT, NW-TT, and TSCTSF also support procedures for port management and user plane node management. Clause 5 describes the elementary procedures between the TSCTSF and DS-TT for port management for time synchronization, while Clause 6 details the procedures between the TSCTSF and NW-TT for port management (Clause 6.2) and user plane node management (Clause 6.3) for time synchronization. The operations supported by the TSCTSF for port management and user plane node management are also listed in 3GPP TS 23.501, tables 5.28.3.1-1 and 5.28.3.1-2.

It is important to note that what is applicable for a TSN AF in this technical specification can be applied to a TSCTSF unless specified otherwise.","The answer should cover the deployment and roles of DS-TT and NW-TT, the integration with IEEE TSN network, and the deployment of TSN AF. It should explain the procedures for port management and user plane node management, including the operations listed in 3GPP TS 23.501 tables 5.28.3.1-1 and 5.28.3.1-2. Additionally, it should describe the NEF's role in exposing 5GS capabilities and the TSCTSF's role in managing synchronization."
Explain the process and considerations for applying ROHC in MCPTT over MBMS as per 3GPP TS 24.380.,"Robust Header Compression (ROHC) is used to compress packet headers in MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) to save network resources. In the context of MCPTT (Mission Critical Push-To-Talk) over MBMS, the participating MCPTT function can either apply ROHC before sending packets to the BM-SC (Broadcast Multicast Service Center) over the MB2-U interface or request the BM-SC to apply ROHC. This process is detailed in 3GPP TS 29.468.

The sequence of operations for header compression and decompression is crucial: header compression is performed after media plane encryption, and header decompression is done before media plane decryption. This ensures that the integrity and confidentiality of the media content are maintained.

MCPTT supports two ROHC profiles for header compression: profile 0x0101 for RTP/UDP/IP compression, specified in RFC 5225, and profile 0x0000 for sending uncompressed packets, specified in RFC 3075. When MBMS subchannels are encoded with profile 0x0101, a distinct CID (ROHC context ID) is used for each subchannel. Conversely, a common CID may be used for all MBMS subchannels encoded with profile 0x0000.

Before establishing an MBMS bearer with header compression, the participating MCPTT function determines the value for the MAX_CID parameter, as specified in clause 5.1.2 of RFC 5795. If MAX_CID is greater than 15, the header compressor uses the large CID representation; otherwise, it uses the small CID representation.

Additionally, only the unidirectional mode of operation, as described in clause 4.4.1 of IETF RFC 3095, is used for MCPTT over MBMS. This mode is suitable for scenarios where data flows in one direction, which aligns with the typical use case of MCPTT communications.","The answer must include:

Describe the flow description rules and matching criteria for IPFlow nodes as specified in TS 24.312 subclauses 5.7.5 and 5.7.6.,"The IPFlow node, as specified in TS 24.312 subclause 5.7.5, indicates the flow description for a particular flow distribution rule. It occurs once, is formatted as a node, and can be accessed via Get or Replace. An empty IPFlow node indicates a match-all flow description. If the flow distribution rule contains more than one instance of the IPFlow node, the User Equipment (UE) shall consider the flow distribution rule if at least one of the flow descriptions matches the traffic.

In TS 24.312 subclause 5.7.6, the interior node acts as a placeholder for one or more flow descriptions. It occurs one or more times, is formatted as a node, and can be accessed via Get or Replace. If the flow description is defined with more than one interior node or leaf (such as App-ID, AddressType, etc.) within a single IPFlow node, the UE shall consider the flow description matching the traffic only if all the present interior nodes and leaf values match the traffic.","The answer should include the definition and occurrence of the IPFlow node, its format, and access types.

"Describe the test purpose, conformance requirements, and test procedure sequence for event A2 measurement reporting in EN-DC mode as specified in TS 38.523.","The test purpose for event A2 measurement reporting in EN-DC mode, as specified in TS 38.523, involves ensuring that the UE sends MeasurementReport messages at regular intervals when the serving NR cell becomes worse than the absolute threshold minus hysteresis, and stops sending these messages when the serving NR cell becomes better than the absolute threshold plus hysteresis. 

The conformance requirements for this test are referenced from TS 36.331 and TS 38.331. Specifically, TS 36.331 clause 5.3.5.3 outlines the procedures for RRCConnectionReconfiguration and radio resource configuration, while TS 38.331 clauses 5.3.5.3 and 5.5.4.3 detail the measurement configuration procedures and the conditions for event A2.

The pre-test conditions include setting up a system simulator where EUTRA Cell 1 is the PCell and NR Cell 1 is the PSCell. The UE should be in the RRC_CONNECTED state using EN-DC mode with DC Bearers on E-UTRA Cell 1.

"Describe the process and implications of applying, modifying, or removing barring services in a mobile network.","The process of applying, modifying, or removing barring services in a mobile network involves several key steps and components, primarily managed by the Home Location Register (HLR). When barring of outgoing calls, mobile originated short messages, supplementary services access, or Packet Oriented Services is applied, modified, or removed by administrative action in the HLR, the HLR updates the subscription information accordingly. This updated subscription information is then transferred to the Visitor Location Register (VLR) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) using one or more Insert Subscriber Data operations.

For outgoing calls or mobile originated short messages, the HLR updates the subscription information and transfers it to the VLR and SGSN. If operator-specific barring is applied, modified, or removed, the HLR updates the subscription information and transfers it to the VLR and SGSN if the mobile subscriber is registered in the home Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of outgoing calls, the VLR and SGSN indicate this in the acknowledgement of the Insert Subscriber Data message. The HLR then has the option to apply the Outgoing Calls Barred supplementary service, apply barring of roaming, or take other actions decided by the operator of the HPLMN.

For supplementary services access, the HLR updates the subscription information and transfers it to the VLR if necessary. If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of supplementary service access, the VLR indicates this in the acknowledgement to the Insert Subscriber Data message. The HLR then has the option to apply barring of roaming or take other actions decided by the operator of the HPLMN.

For Packet Oriented Services, the HLR updates the subscription information and transfers it to the SGSN. If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of Packet Oriented Services, the SGSN indicates this in the acknowledgement of the Insert Subscriber Data message. The HLR then has the option to apply barring of roaming or take other actions decided by the operator of the HPLMN.

In summary, the HLR plays a crucial role in managing barring services by updating and transferring subscription information to the VLR and SGSN. The handling of operator-specific barring and the implications if the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring involve several possible actions by the HPLMN, including applying supplementary services, barring of roaming, or other operator-decided actions.","The answer must include the following key details:

Describe the process and requirements for physical layer measurements in the RRC_CONNECTED state as defined in 3GPP documents.,"The process and requirements for physical layer measurements in the RRC_CONNECTED state are comprehensively defined in various 3GPP documents. 

Firstly, physical layer measurements are defined in TS 36.214 clause 5, where the measurements reported to higher layers are specified. These measurements are crucial for maintaining and optimizing network performance.

When the UE (User Equipment) is in the RRC_CONNECTED state on a cell, physical layer measurements are initiated and reported to higher layers as outlined in TS 36.521 clause 9. The initiation of a specific measurement involves the System Simulator sending an 'RRC Connection Reconfiguration message' to the UE. This message includes a measurement ID and type, a command (setup, modify, release), measurement objects, measurement quantity, reporting quantities, and reporting criteria (periodical/event-triggered). Once the reporting criteria are met, the UE sends a 'Measurement Report message' to the System Simulator, which includes the measurement ID and results.

The reporting criteria that trigger the UE to send a 'Measurement Report message' are defined in TS 36.331 clause 5.5.4. These criteria are typically periodical, ensuring regular updates on the measurement results.

Accuracy requirements for these measurements are stringent. The performance results must be within specified limits, and the reported measurement results after layer 1 filtering should be an estimate of the average value of the measured quantity over the measurement period. These accuracy requirements are valid under AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) radio propagation conditions and assume independent interference at each receiver antenna port.

Specific conditions and configurations for physical layer measurements include:
- Reference sensitivity requirements, which vary depending on the supported band.
- Measurements must be within the defined range in 90% of cases.
- Measurement channels are defined in Annex A, used both in the active cell and cells to be measured.
- Reference channels assume transmission of PDSCH with a maximum of 5 HARQ transmissions unless otherwise specified.
- SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A for C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Annex A1, with downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
- Uplink configuration is according to clause A.3.
- Propagation condition is AWGN as defined in Annex B.
- Physical channels used are defined in Annex C.
- Cell 1 is the active cell.
- Single task reporting.
- Power control is active.

For Band 26, tests are performed with the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth within 865-894 MHz. For RSRP accuracy test cases with more than 5 cells, intra-frequency relative RSRP accuracy can be measured on each SCC by time-switching the neighbor cell sequentially instead of measuring all neighbor cells simultaneously. The PCell and all SCells remain active, and the UE is configured to measure all the PCell and SCells throughout the test.","The answer must include the definition of physical layer measurements, the process for initiating and reporting these measurements, the criteria for reporting, and the accuracy requirements. It should also cover specific conditions and configurations such as reference sensitivity requirements, AWGN propagation conditions, measurement channels, power control, and special cases for Band 26 and RSRP accuracy tests."
"Describe the process and key elements involved in the allocation and activation of radio resources and Channel Codec Units (CCU) during call setup and handover in a 3GPP network, referencing the relevant procedures for different types of speech and data calls.","During call setup in a 3GPP network, when a circuit-switched connection is required, the Base Station Controller (BSC) allocates an appropriate Transcoder and Rate Adaptation Unit (TRAU) to the circuit to be used between the BSC and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS). The BSC then sends a CHANNEL ACTIVATION message to the BTS. Upon receiving this message, the BTS allocates the necessary radio resources and a Channel Codec Unit (CCU).

It should also cover the Initial Time Alignment state, time alignment, and phase alignment processes, and mention the procedure for BSS external handover."
How does TS 26.234 address network congestion and transmission rate adaptation in RTP sessions?,"TS 26.234 addresses network congestion in RTP sessions by implementing RTP retransmission and link-rate estimation. To avoid network congestion due to the additional bandwidth required for retransmitting lost packets, a PSS server or client must estimate the available link rate and adapt the total transmission rate of the RTP session, including retransmissions, to the available link rate. The algorithms for link-rate estimation and transmission-rate adaptation are implementation-specific, but rules and information sources for link-rate estimation are provided in clause 10.2.1. 

For transmission rate adaptation, a PSS server can skip retransmissions, use the transmission rate adaptation methods described in clause 10.2.2, or employ other suitable methods. If the server uses multiple streams for rate adaptation, it should not flush its retransmission buffer after switching streams to ensure efficient handling of retransmission requests.

The transmission adaptation is also implementation-dependent, and server extensions allow storing alternative encodings useful for stream switching. Despite content rate adaptation, the server must deliver content according to the SDP description of the media streams, ensuring that the video stream delivered after adaptation still belongs to the SDP announced profile and is consistent with any configuration. This requirement may restrict the possible alternatives or necessitate the declaration of several RTP payload types or media encodings that might not be used.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how network congestion is avoided through RTP retransmission and link-rate estimation.
  - Description of the adaptation of total transmission rate including retransmissions.

"Describe the process and conditions under which a participating MCPTT function handles a SIP REFER request with the 'method' SIP URI parameter set to 'BYE' from an MCPTT client, including the subsequent actions taken upon receiving a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP BYE request.","Upon receiving a SIP REFER request with the 'method' SIP URI parameter set to 'BYE' in the URI in the Refer-To header field from the MCPTT client, the participating MCPTT function follows a specific process:

1. **Determination of MCPTT ID**: The function shall determine the MCPTT ID of the calling user from the public user identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP REFER request.

2. **Rejection Conditions**: If the function cannot find a binding between the public user identity and an MCPTT ID, it shall reject the SIP REFER request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response. The warning text in the Warning header field will be set to '141 user unknown to the participating function', and no further steps will be taken.

3. **Handling Specific Header Fields**: If the SIP REFER request contains a Refer-Sub header field with the value 'false' and a Supported header field with the value 'norefersub', the function shall handle the request according to 3GPP TS 24.229, IETF RFC 3515, IETF RFC 6665, and IETF RFC 4488 without establishing an implicit subscription.

4. **Generation of SIP 200 (OK) Response**: The function shall generate a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REFER request. This response will include:
   - The Supported header field with the value 'norefersub' as per IETF RFC 4488.
   - The Refer-Sub header field with the value 'false' if it was present and set to 'false' in the SIP REFER request.

5. **Sending SIP 200 (OK) Response**: The SIP 200 (OK) response shall be sent to the MCPTT client according to 3GPP TS 24.229.

"Describe the authorization mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 for NF service access, including the roles of OAuth 2.0 and the handling of access tokens.","3GPP TS 33.501 specifies two alternative authorization mechanisms for NF service access: static authorization and token-based authorization. Static authorization is based on local authorization policies at the NRF and the NF Service Producer. Token-based authorization involves the NRF acting as the Authorization Server, providing access tokens to NF service consumers.

OAuth 2.0 is used for authorization of NF service access, with the 'Client Credentials' grant type being supported by all NFs and the NRF. The NRF provides 'Bearer' access tokens to NF service consumers, who include these tokens in the 'Authorization' HTTP request header when accessing NF services. NF service producers validate the access token, its expiry, and its access scope before granting access to the requested resource.

The access scope required for resource access can be either the service name of the NF Service for generic access or both the service name and a string representing the type of operation, resource, and service for specific authorization. NF service consumers discover the required scopes based on authorization information registered in the NRF by NF service producers.

If an NF service producer rejects an API request due to an invalid or missing OAuth 2.0 access token, it returns a '401 Unauthorized' status code with a 'WWW-Authenticate' header. If the token lacks the required scopes, a '403 Forbidden' status code is returned with the necessary scopes indicated in the 'WWW-Authenticate' header. NF service consumers should not repeat requests with the same invalid or expired token but may retry with a new token.

In cases where an NF service producer accepts requests without an OAuth 2.0 access token based on local policy, it is assumed that such accesses are allowed based on trust relationships, granting full access to the resource.","The answer should cover the two alternative authorization mechanisms (static and token-based), the role of OAuth 2.0 in NF service access, the responsibilities of NRF as the Authorization Server, the handling of access tokens by NF service consumers and producers, and the HTTP status codes and headers used for authorization errors. It should also mention the specific scopes required for resource access and the conditions under which requests may be accepted or rejected."
"Explain the concept and coding of the Transaction Identifier (TI) in 3GPP protocols, including its extension mechanism and error handling.","The Transaction Identifier (TI) in 3GPP protocols is a crucial element used to distinguish different bi-directional message flows for a given Protocol Data (PD) and Service Access Point (SAP). In standard Layer 3 (L3) messages, bits 5 to 8 of octet 1 contain the TI, allowing up to 16 different message flows. The TI consists of the TI value and the TI flag, where the TI value occupies bits 5 to 7 and the TI flag occupies bit 8.

An extension mechanism for the TI is defined to allow up to 256 different message flows. This mechanism should only be used if explicitly stated in the core specifications for the protocol. When the extended TI is used, the TI Information Element (IE) includes a second octet, and the TI value is encoded in bits 7-1 of the second octet, while the TI value in the first octet is ignored.

The TI flag, which can be either '0' or '1', is used to identify the side of the interface that initiated the transaction. A message with a TI flag set to '0' indicates it belongs to a transaction initiated by the sender, while a flag set to '1' indicates it belongs to a transaction initiated by the receiver. This flag helps resolve simultaneous attempts to allocate the same TI value.

TI values are dynamically assigned at the beginning of a transaction by the side initiating it. A free TI value is chosen and remains fixed for the transaction's lifetime. After the transaction ends, the TI value is freed and can be reassigned. Identical TI values can be used for transactions initiated by different sides of the interface, with the TI flag avoiding ambiguity.

Error handling related to TI values includes the '111' encoding of bits 5-7 in octet 1, which is treated as an error case for protocols not using the extended TI. This encoding is referenced in other specifications concerning error handling.

The coding of the TI is depicted in Figure 8.68-1 and is defined in 3GPP TS 24.301, clause 9.9.4.17, and specified in 3GPP TS 24.007, clause 11.2.3.1.3.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The standard bits used for TI in octet 1 and the extension mechanism for up to 256 message flows.
- The role and values of the TI flag in distinguishing transaction initiators.

"Describe the disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range information elements, including their coding and storage specifications.","The disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range information elements are designed to provide specific wait ranges to the User Equipment (UE) in disaster scenarios. 

The registration wait range information element, which encompasses both the disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range, is a type 4 information element with a length of 4 octets. This element is coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501, with detailed coding provided in figure 9.11.3.84.1 and table 9.11.3.84.1.

In terms of storage, if service number 140 is marked as 'available' in the Elementary File (EF) EFUST, this file must be present. The EF contains indicators for whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, as well as parameters for disaster roaming, including the disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range. These parameters are stored regardless of their presence or absence, with unused bytes set to 'FF'.

The disaster roaming wait range is coded starting from octet 3 of the registration wait range, as defined in figure 9.11.3.84.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501. Similarly, the disaster return wait range follows the same coding structure. Additionally, the applicability indicator for the 'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition' provided by the Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN) is also coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501.

Each disaster roaming information parameter is marked as present or absent by individual bits within a byte, with specific bit allocations indicating different parameters. For example, bit 1 indicates the disaster roaming wait range, bit 2 indicates the disaster return wait range, and bit 3 indicates the applicability indicator for the list of PLMN(s). Bits 4 to 8 are reserved and set to 1. The bit value '0' signifies that the parameter is present, while '1' signifies that the parameter is absent.","The answer should include the purpose of the registration wait range information element, its type and length, and detailed coding as per TS 24.501. It should also cover the storage requirements in EFUST, coding specifics for disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range, and the applicability indicator for 'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition' as per TS 31.102. References to relevant figures and tables should be included for clarity."
"Explain the role and configuration of the Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI) in 3GPP specifications, including its activation, usage in downlink and uplink procedures, and its interaction with other QoS parameters.","The Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI) is a key parameter in 3GPP specifications that indicates whether Reflective QoS is applied for a given packet. According to TS 29.244, the RQI is encoded as a single bit, where a value of 0 deactivates Reflective QoS and a value of 1 activates it. This indicator is crucial for managing QoS in both uplink and downlink directions.

In the downlink direction, as specified in TS 38.415 clause 5.5.3.4, the RQI indicates the activation of Reflective QoS towards the User Equipment (UE). If Reflective QoS Activation (RQA) has not been configured for the involved QoS flow, the NG-RAN node will ignore the RQI. This ensures that Reflective QoS is only applied when explicitly configured, preventing unintended QoS changes.

The DL PDU Session Information procedure, detailed in TS 38.415 clause 5.4.1.1, includes the RQI field to indicate whether user plane Reflective QoS should be activated. This procedure also involves other QoS parameters such as the QoS Flow Identifier (QFI) and Paging Policy Indicator (PPI), which help determine the QoS profile and paging policy for the transferred packet. The NG-RAN uses the received QFI to identify the QoS flow and profile associated with the packet, and if RQA is configured, it takes the RQI into account.

While the UL PDU Session Information procedure, described in TS 38.415 clause 5.4.2.1, does not explicitly mention RQI, it provides context on how QoS parameters are handled in the uplink direction. This procedure includes fields like QFI and QoS Monitoring Packet (QMP), which are essential for QoS monitoring and delay reporting.

The QoS Monitoring Packet (QMP) parameter, as outlined in TS 38.415 clause 5.5.3.8, indicates whether the transferred packet is used for QoS monitoring. It includes timestamps and delay results, which are crucial for calculating UL, DL, or RTT delay. If QoS monitoring is not configured for the involved QoS flow, the QMP is ignored by the NG-RAN node.

Overall, the RQI plays a significant role in managing Reflective QoS, ensuring that QoS parameters are correctly applied and monitored in both uplink and downlink procedures.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Definition and encoding of the Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI) as per TS 29.244.
- Activation and deactivation states of RQI and their implications.
- Usage of RQI in the downlink direction as specified in TS 38.415, including conditions for ignoring RQI.

"Describe the requirements and procedures for IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW to handle ECN capabilities in SDP offers and answers, referencing the relevant 3GPP specifications.","The requirements and procedures for IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW to handle ECN capabilities in SDP offers and answers are specified in various clauses of 3GPP TS 23.334 and TS 29.162.

Firstly, according to TS 23.334 clause 5.12.3, the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW must apply the requirements specified in clause 10.2.13.3 of 3GPP TS 29.162, replacing the IBCF and TrGW with IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW respectively. If the IMS-ALG or IMS-AGW does not support the procedure to act as an ECN endpoint, the IMS-ALG should not include the 'a=ecn-capable-rtp' attribute in the SDP offer it forwards to the succeeding node.

Secondly, TS 29.162 clause 10.2.13.3 outlines the conditions under which the IBCF may include the 'a=ecn-capable-rtp' attribute in SDP offers. These conditions include:
a) The IBCF supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114.
b) The TrGW supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114.
c) The IBCF knows (via configuration) that the succeeding network supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114.
If these conditions are met, the IBCF may include the 'a=ecn-capable-rtp' attribute in the SDP offer it forwards towards the succeeding node. If the IBCF receives an SDP answer containing the 'a=ecn-capable-rtp' attribute, it must act as an endpoint and return the SDP answer to the preceding node, removing certain ECN-related attributes and indicating to the TrGW to apply ECN procedures according to 3GPP TS 26.114.

Additionally, TS 23.334 clause 5.12.4 specifies that IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW that support the procedure to act as an ECN endpoint must support the requirements specified in clause 10.2.13.3a of 3GPP TS 29.162, replacing the IBCF and TrGW with IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW respectively.

Finally, TS 29.162 clause 10.4.1.9 describes the procedure for reporting ECN-related failures, referencing clause 10.2.13.3a. This procedure is used to report ECN-related failures towards the IM Subsystem.

In summary, the handling of ECN capabilities in SDP offers and answers by IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW involves specific conditions for including or excluding the 'a=ecn-capable-rtp' attribute, detailed procedures for IBCF when handling SDP offers and answers, requirements for IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW to act as ECN endpoints, and procedures for reporting ECN-related failures.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the procedure for measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy in a UE according to 3GPP TS 36.521, including the role of the timeAlignmentTimer as specified in 3GPP TS 36.321.","The procedure for measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy in a UE according to 3GPP TS 36.521 involves several steps and configurations. Initially, the UE must be in State 3A-RF-CE with condition CEModeB. The test consists of two successive time periods, T1 and T2, during which timing advance commands are sent to the UE, and PUSCH transmissions are received by the SS.

During T1, the SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, and the UE responds with an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message. The SS then sends a timing advance command (TA) set to 31, indicating an adjustment of the current NTA value to 0. The UE adjusts its uplink timing at the beginning of sub-frame n+6 for the TA received in sub-frame n. When T1 expires, the SS switches the TA to T2, setting it to 39, which adjusts the NTA value to 128. The UE again adjusts its uplink timing at the beginning of sub-frame n+6 for the TA received in sub-frame n.

The accuracy of the timing advance adjustment is measured by comparing the timing of the UE's transmission to the signaled timing advance value, ensuring it is within ±4.5 × TS. Successful adjustments increase the count of successful tests, while failures increase the count of failed tests.

The timeAlignmentTimer, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.321, plays a crucial role in this procedure. It ensures that the UE remains uplink time aligned throughout the test. The timer is started or restarted whenever a timing advance command is received. If the timer expires, the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for the associated serving cells, flushes HARQ buffers, and notifies RRC to release resources.

The test is repeated until the confidence level specified in the relevant tables is achieved, ensuring the UE's timing advance adjustment accuracy is thoroughly validated.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The initial setup and configuration of the UE in State 3A-RF-CE with condition CEModeB.

Describe the procedures for querying and fetching VNF Packages from the NFVO as outlined in TS 28.526.,"The procedures for querying and fetching VNF Packages from the NFVO as outlined in TS 28.526 involve specific steps and parameters to ensure accurate retrieval of information.

For querying VNF Package information:
1. The NM (Network Manager) sends a QueryOnboardedVnfPkgInfoRequest to the NFVO (Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator). This request includes filter and attributeSelector parameters to specify which VNF Packages to query and which attributes of the OnboardedVnfPkgInfo to return.
2. The NFVO responds with a QueryOnboardedVnfPkgInfoResponse, which includes the queryResult parameter. This parameter provides the requested information based on the filter and attributeSelector parameters.

For fetching a whole VNF Package:
1. If the NM already knows the onboardedVnfPkgInfoId for the VNF Package it wishes to fetch, it can skip the initial steps and begin at step 3.
2. Otherwise, the NM sends a QueryOnboardedVnfPkgInfoRequest to the NFVO with the filter parameter set to the VNFD identifier assigned by the VNF Provider and the attributeSelector set to OnboardedVnfPkgId.
3. The NFVO responds with a QueryOnboardedVnfPkgInfoResponse, providing the OnboardedVnfPkgId identifier allocated by the NFVO to the corresponding VNF package.
4. The NM then sends a FetchOnboardedVnfPackageRequest to the NFVO, including the onboardedVnfPkgInfoId parameter to identify the VNF Package to fetch.
5. The NFVO responds with a FetchOnboardedVnfPackageResponse, providing the requested VNF Package.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in the creation, update, and deletion of an 'Individual PC5 Provisioning Requirement Subscription' resource as per 3GPP TS 29.486 specifications.","The process of managing an 'Individual PC5 Provisioning Requirement Subscription' resource involves several key steps and elements as outlined in the 3GPP TS 29.486 specifications.

1. **Creation of the Subscription Resource:**
   - The NF service consumer initiates the creation process by sending an HTTP POST request to the VAE Server. This request includes the ProvisioningRequirement data structure in the payload body.
   - The ProvisioningRequirement data structure must contain the following attributes:
     - `notifUri`: Notification URI.
     - `ueId` or `groupId`: Either the remote V2X UE ID or the V2X group ID.
     - `serviceId`: V2X service ID.
     - `appQosReq`: Application QoS requirements for the session.
     - Optionally, `plmnList`: PLMN ID list.
   - Upon receiving the HTTP POST request, the VAE Server performs authorization based on the provided information. If successful, the VAE Server creates a new resource representing the 'Individual PC5 Provisioning Requirement Subscription' and responds with a 201 Created message. The response includes a Location header field containing the URI for the created resource.

2. **Updating the Subscription Resource:**
   - To update the subscription, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP PUT request to the VAE Server, including the ProvisioningRequirement data structure in the payload body.
   - The attributes `ueId`, `serviceId`, and `groupId` must remain unchanged from their previous values.
   - The VAE Server performs authorization upon receiving the HTTP PUT request. If successful, the VAE Server updates the subscription resource and responds with either a 200 OK or 204 No Content status code.

3. **Deleting the Subscription Resource:**
   - The NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request to the VAE Server, specifying the URI of the subscription resource.
   - The VAE Server checks if the resource exists. If it does, the VAE Server deletes the resource and responds with a 204 No Content success message.

4. **Error Handling Procedures:**
   - If errors occur during the processing of HTTP POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, the VAE Server applies error handling procedures as specified in clause 6.9.7.

5. **Resource URI Structure:**
   - The URI for the 'Individual PC5 Provisioning Requirement Subscription' resource follows the structure: `{apiRoot}/vae-pc5-prov-req/<apiVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`.

6. **Notification Process:**
   - After determining the updated PC5 provisioning policies/parameters, the VAE Server sends an HTTP POST request to the NF service consumer using the `notifUri` provided during subscription creation.
   - The Notification data structure in the request body includes:
     - `resourceUri`: Resource URI of the related subscription.
     - `result`: Result of the V2X PC5 provisioning requirement.

What are the requirements and conditions for a UE to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within Tidentify_intra_without_index as specified in TS 38.533 and TS 38.133?,"The requirements and conditions for a UE to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within Tidentify_intra_without_index are detailed in TS 38.533 and TS 38.133. The UE must be able to identify the cell within Tidentify_intra_without_index if it is not configured to report SSB based RRM measurement results with the associated SSB index, or if the neighbor cell is indicated to be synchronous with the serving cell. The calculation of Tidentify_intra_without_index is given by the sum of TPSS/SSS_sync_intra and TSSB_measurement_period_intra, where TPSS/SSS_sync_intra is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection and TSSB_measurement_period_intra is the measurement period of SSB based measurement.

The carrier specific scaling factor, CSSFintra, is determined according to CSSFwithin_gap,i for measurements conducted within measurement gaps. For different power classes in FR2, the values of Mpss/sss_sync_with_gaps and Mmeas_period_with_gaps are specified, with power class 1 having values of 40, and power classes 2, 3, and 4 having values of 24.

An intra-frequency cell is considered detectable when the SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR related side conditions are fulfilled for the corresponding band, as specified in TS 38.133 sections 10.1.2, 10.1.7, and 10.1.12, respectively.

"Describe the tunneling techniques used for delivering unstructured PDU type data at the N6 interface, including the configuration and handling of these tunnels.","At the N6 interface, unstructured PDU type data can be delivered using various Point-to-Point (PtP) tunneling techniques. The primary techniques include UDP/IPv6 encapsulation and other mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE and L2TP.

For UDP/IPv6 tunneling, the configuration involves setting up tunnel parameters at both ends of the tunnel. The User Plane Function (UPF) is pre-configured with the following parameters per Data Network Name (DNN):
- The UDP destination port number for sending unstructured PDU type data.
- The UDP port number for receiving unstructured PDU type data.
- The destination IP address for sending unstructured PDU type data.

Similarly, the Application Server (AS) is pre-configured with:
- The UDP destination port number for sending unstructured PDU type data.
- The UDP port number for receiving unstructured PDU type data.

The IP address allocation for the User Equipment (UE) is managed by the Session Management Function (SMF), which assigns a suffix for the PDU session. The UPF uses the IPv6 prefix allocated for the PDU session plus the suffix assigned for the PtP tunnel as the source address for uplink data and the destination address for downlink data.

During PDU session establishment, the UPF associates the GTP-U tunnel for the PDU session with the N6 PtP tunnel. The UPF acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE and the AS. For uplink delivery, the UPF forwards the received data from the GTP-U tunnel to the AS over the N6 PtP tunnel using the configured UDP destination port number. For downlink delivery, the AS sends the data using UDP/IP encapsulation with the IPv6 prefix plus suffix as the destination address and the configured UDP destination port number. The UPF decapsulates the received data and forwards it on the GTP-U tunnel identified by the IPv6 prefix of the UE.

Alternative tunneling mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE and L2TP can also be used. The UPF establishes a PtP tunnel towards the AS, which may be done during PDU session establishment or when the first Mobile Originated (MO) datagram is sent by the UE. The UPF selects the AS based on its configuration, such as per DNN or PtP tunnel type. The UPF acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE and the AS. For uplink delivery, the UPF forwards the received data to the AS over the established N6 PtP tunnel. For downlink delivery, the AS locates the appropriate N6 PtP tunnel for the UE using information such as UE identifiers in the unstructured PDU type protocol and sends the data to the UPF over the established N6 PtP tunnel. The UPF then forwards the data on the GTP-U tunnel identified by the associated N6 PtP tunnel for delivery to the UE.

In summary, the tunneling techniques at the N6 interface for unstructured PDU type data include UDP/IPv6 encapsulation and other mechanisms like PMIPv6/GRE and L2TP, with specific configuration parameters and handling procedures for each method.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The types of tunneling techniques supported at the N6 interface for unstructured PDU type data.
  - Configuration parameters required for UDP/IPv6 tunneling, including UDP port numbers and IP addresses.
  - The role of UPF in associating GTP-U tunnels with N6 PtP tunnels and acting as a transparent forwarding node.
  - The process of uplink and downlink data delivery using UDP/IPv6 encapsulation.
  - Alternative tunneling mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, and their handling procedures.
  - The selection and configuration of AS based on different protocols and tunnel types."
Describe the criteria and agreements related to the selection and evaluation of Training Sequence Codes (TSC) and SACCH mappings in MUROS as per 3GPP TS 45.914.,"The selection and evaluation of Training Sequence Codes (TSC) and SACCH mappings in MUROS as per 3GPP TS 45.914 involve several criteria and agreements made at various GERAN meetings. 

For TSC selection, the criteria agreed upon at GERAN#39 include:
- Legacy TSC is used on the 1st subchannel.
- New proposed TSC is used on the 2nd subchannel.
- Performance of TSC pairs is evaluated.
- Restriction to a single interferer scenario MTS-1 with the interferer either using GMSK or MUROS modulation type.
- Both Downlink (DL) and Uplink (UL) will be evaluated.
- Evaluation of the cross-correlation performance of new TSCs, with the evaluation method left open.

At GERAN 1 Adhoc on EGPRS2/WIDER/MUROS, the following agreements were achieved:
- Fixed pairs will be used for the training sequence evaluation, but there was no agreement to standardize training sequence pairs.
- Newly proposed TRS sets will be included in the TR without corresponding performance simulation results to avoid overloading the TR.
- Selection could wait until after a Work Item (WI) is opened.
- No new proposals for training sequences will be accepted unless they show a significant performance improvement of approximately 0.5 dB.

At MUROS telco#7, the agreements included:
- Contributions can be provided by companies to check the cross-correlation properties of unpaired sequences at GERAN#40.
- Voting will be used at GERAN#40 to select the best sequence among the candidate sets.

At GERAN#40, it was agreed to freeze the work related to the evaluation of the best TSC set until a work item is started. Further training sequence evaluation and final selection of the TSC set will take place within the successive work item VAMOS.

At GERAN#41, an offline session on further proceedings related to the TSC evaluation work was held. It was agreed that the proposed candidate in section 10.1.7 (RIM-2) is selected for VAMOS.

For SACCH mappings in DRSACCH, the conditions that must be satisfied include:
1) The Mobile Station (MS) must be MUROS-capable, and for Uplink (UL), an MS assigned with a new training sequence from TSC Set 2 is required.
2) The MUROS subchannel must be in Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) mode.
3) The designated TDMA frame for transmission of SACCH repetition must not be occupied for any other purposes.

If these conditions are not met, the channel organization shown in Fig. 11.3-1 will be used. The specific mappings for different user rates are:
- For user u (full rate)
- For user u' (full rate)
- For user u1 (half rate)
- For user u2 (half rate)
- For user u1' (half rate)
- For user u2' (half rate)

The SACCH mappings in DRSACCH are designed to avoid pairing a SACCH repetition frame in one MUROS subchannel with a normal SACCH frame, a shifted SACCH frame, or a SACCH repetition frame in the other MUROS subchannel. This design consideration maximizes the benefits from DTX operation.","The answer should include the criteria for selecting TSCs, the agreements made at various GERAN meetings regarding TSC evaluation and selection, the conditions required for SACCH mappings in DRSACCH, and the specific mappings for different user rates. Additionally, it should cover the design considerations to avoid pairing SACCH repetition frames with normal or shifted SACCH frames."
"Explain the concept of RRMPolicyRatio in the context of network slice instances, including its attributes and how it is used for resource management in a 5G network.","The RRMPolicyRatio is a key concept in managing Radio Resource Management (RRM) resources for network slice instances in a 5G network. It is used to define and allocate resources among different network slice instances, ensuring that each slice receives the appropriate amount of resources based on its requirements.

The RRMPolicyRatio is an implementation of the abstract RRMPolicy IOC and includes several attributes that help in defining the resource quotas for network slice instances. These attributes are:
- **rRMPolicyMaxRatio**: This attribute defines the maximum resource usage quota for the associated RRMPolicyMemberList, which includes shared, prioritized, and dedicated resources. The sum of the rRMPolicyMaxRatio values assigned to all RRMPolicyRatios within the same ManagedEntity can exceed 100.
- **rRMPolicyMinRatio**: This attribute specifies the minimum resource usage quota that must be guaranteed for the associated RRMPolicyMemberList. It includes prioritized and dedicated resources. The sum of the rRMPolicyMinRatio values assigned to all RRMPolicyRatios within the same ManagedEntity must be less than or equal to 100.
- **rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio**: This attribute defines the dedicated resource usage quota for the RRMPolicyMemberList, which includes resources that cannot be shared with other members. The sum of the rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio values assigned to all RRMPolicyRatios within the same ManagedEntity must be less than or equal to 100.

The resources are categorized as follows:
- **Shared resources**: These resources are shared among different RRMPolicyMemberLists and are not guaranteed for any specific member. The quota for shared resources is represented by the difference between rRMPolicyMaxRatio and rRMPolicyMinRatio.
- **Prioritized resources**: These resources are preferentially used by the associated RRMPolicyMemberList and are guaranteed when needed. When not in use, they can be utilized by other members. The quota for prioritized resources is represented by the difference between rRMPolicyMinRatio and rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio.
- **Dedicated resources**: These resources are exclusively reserved for the associated RRMPolicyMemberList and cannot be shared with others. The quota for dedicated resources is represented by rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio.

The C-SON (Centralized Self-Organizing Network) function plays a crucial role in monitoring and optimizing RRM resources. It collects performance measurements from RAN nodes (such as DU, CUUP, and CUCP) and uses AI/ML models to analyze traffic loads and patterns. Based on this analysis, the C-SON function can determine if any actions are needed to optimize the RRM resources for network slice instances.

If an update to the RRM resources is required, the C-SON function follows a specific procedure to update the RRMPolicyRatio for different network functions:
1. The C-SON function consumes the MnS (Management Service) of NF (Network Function) provisioning to modify the RRMPolicyRatio attributes for the relevant network function (DU, CUUP, or CUCP).
2. The MnS of NF provisioning updates the RRMPolicyRatio at the respective network function.
3. The producer of the provisioning MnS sends a notification to the C-SON function indicating the successful update of the RRMPolicyRatio.

This process ensures that the RRM resources are dynamically managed and optimized to meet the varying demands of different network slice instances, thereby enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the 5G network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Definition and purpose of RRMPolicyRatio in managing RRM resources for network slice instances.
  - Explanation of the attributes of RRMPolicyRatio (rRMPolicyMaxRatio, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio) and how they define shared, prioritized, and dedicated resources.
  - The role of the C-SON function in monitoring and optimizing RRM resources using performance measurements and AI/ML models.
  - The procedure for updating RRMPolicyRatio for different network functions (DU, CUUP, CUCP) and the communication between C-SON function and network functions."

Describe the procedures and clarifications for group management service in MSGin5G as specified in 3GPP TS 24.538.,"The group management service in MSGin5G, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.538, involves several key procedures. Firstly, the group creation procedure is detailed in clause 6.2.2. This procedure outlines how groups are formed and managed within the MSGin5G service. Additionally, the MSGin5G Client and MSGin5G Server utilize group management service procedures of SEAL to support the MSGin5G Service. The applicable procedures from SEAL include group creation (clause 6.2.2), group configuration management (clause 6.2.5), and group membership update (clause 6.2.4). 

A specific clarification is provided for the group creation process: upon receiving a Group Creation notification, for a list of VAL user IDs or VAL UE IDs that do not have a group management client on the UE (such as legacy 3GPP UEs or non-3GPP UEs), the MSGin5G server initiates the group creation notification towards those UEs. This ensures that all relevant UEs are included in the group creation process, even if they lack a group management client.","The answer should cover the group creation procedure as specified in clause 6.2.2, the applicable group management service procedures of SEAL for MSGin5G Service, including group configuration management and group membership update. Additionally, it should include the clarification regarding the group creation notification for UEs without group management client."
Describe the process and requirements for PIN and PIN2 verification in UICC as per 3GPP TS 31.121 specifications.,"The process and requirements for PIN and PIN2 verification in UICC as per 3GPP TS 31.121 specifications are as follows:

1. **PIN Verification Process**:
   - Upon insertion of the UICC and switching on the User Equipment (UE), the Terminal must check the state of the PIN. If the PIN is enabled, the Terminal prompts the user for PIN verification.
   - The VERIFY PIN function is responsible for verifying the PIN presented by the Terminal to the UICC.
   - This process is detailed in TS 31.121 6.1.1.2 and references ETSI TS 102 221 (clauses 9 and 11.1.9), TS 31.102 (clause 6), and TS 22.030 (clause 6.6.1).

2. **PIN2 Verification Process**:
   - Before allowing access to PIN2 protected data, the Terminal must ask the user for PIN2 verification. Only after the user presents the correct PIN2 can they access the protected data.
   - The VERIFY PIN function also verifies the PIN2 presented by the Terminal to the UICC.
   - This process is described in TS 31.121 6.1.4.2 and reiterated in TS 31.121 6.1.13.2, with references to ETSI TS 102 221 (clauses 9 and 11.1.9), TS 31.102 (clause 6), and TS 22.030 (clause 6.6.1).

Describe the handling of Abstract Syntax Errors in SABP messages according to 3GPP TS 25.419.,"Abstract Syntax Errors in SABP messages occur when the receiving functional SABP entity encounters issues with the structure or content of the received message. These errors can be categorized into several specific cases: receiving IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE id), receiving IEs for which the logical range is violated, not receiving IEs or IE groups that should have been present according to the specified presence, receiving IEs or IE groups in the wrong order or with too many occurrences, and receiving IEs or IE groups that should not have been present according to the conditional presence.

The rules for constructing SABP messages specify that IEs must be ordered in the sequence they appear in object set definitions, and the presence field dictates how many times an IE may appear. If a SABP message is not constructed according to these rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error.

When a receiving node encounters a message with IEs or IE groups in the wrong order, with too many occurrences, or erroneously present, it behaves as follows:
- For messages initiating a procedure, the node rejects the procedure and reports the cause value 'Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)' using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcomes. If the information is insufficient to determine a value for all required IEs, the node terminates the procedure and initiates the Error Indication procedure.
- For initiating messages without a message to report unsuccessful outcomes, the node terminates the procedure and initiates the Error Indication procedure with the same cause value.
- For response messages, the node considers the procedure unsuccessfully terminated and initiates local error handling.

The handling of Abstract Syntax Errors is based on Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group causing the error. The receiver reads the remaining message and acts according to these pieces of information for each detected error, as specified in subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The specific actions for cases involving wrong order, too many occurrences, or erroneously present conditional IEs are detailed in subclause 10.3.6.","The answer should include the definition of Abstract Syntax Errors, the specific cases that constitute Abstract Syntax Errors, the rules for constructing SABP messages, and the behavior of the receiving node when encountering such errors. It should also cover the handling based on Criticality and Presence Information, and the specific actions taken for each type of error."
Describe the impact of harmonics and intermodulation products on receiver sensitivity and uplink/downlink configurations for different band combinations as specified in 3GPP TS 37.717.,"The impact of harmonics and intermodulation products on receiver sensitivity and uplink/downlink configurations for different band combinations is thoroughly analyzed in 3GPP TS 37.717. 

For 3DL/2UL interband configurations, reference sensitivity values are defined based on co-existence studies. These values are reused from other documents such as TS 38.101-3 and TR 37.717-11-21.

In the case of DC_25A_n77A, the study includes up to 5th order harmonics and intermodulation products. The analysis shows that the 2nd harmonic of Band 25 uplink may fall into the own Rx of Band n77, and the 2nd harmonic mixing of Band 25 may fall into the uplink of Band n77. Additionally, the 2nd, 4th, and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of Band 25 + Band n77 may fall into the own Rx of Band 25, while the 4th and 5th order IMD may fall into the own Rx of Band n77. To address these issues, MSD values from CA_n25-n77 in TS 38.101-1 are applied to DC_25_n77, as specified in various tables for harmonic and IMD issues, and uplink configurations due to interference.

Similarly, for DC_25A_n78A, the study includes up to 5th order harmonics and intermodulation products.

"Describe the key elements and procedures involved in Tandem Free Operation (TFO) as defined in 3GPP TS 28.062, including version handling, CRC protection, codec information reporting, and configuration frames.","Tandem Free Operation (TFO) in 3GPP TS 28.062 involves several key elements and procedures. 

Firstly, TFO version handling is crucial for ensuring compatibility between different network elements. Before Release 4, no TFO version handling was defined. In Release 4, an 'AMR TFO version number' was introduced, defined in the Ver field of the AMR_ACS and AMR_SCS Extension Blocks and the ATVN field in AMR Configuration frames. Only one version, '0', was defined for Release 4. From Release 5 onwards, the 'TFO Version number' in the 'TFO Version' extension block and 'Generic Configuration Frames' reflects the version and subversion of the corresponding TS 28.062. The smallest defined TFO Version number is 0.0, representing all versions before 5.3, with numbers between 0.0 and 5.3 reserved for future use. If local and distant version numbers differ, the smallest version number takes precedence. TFO supports various speech codec types, including GSM_FR, GSM_HR, GSM_EFR, five AMR Narrow Band codecs, and four AMR Wide Band codecs. Optional and mandatory features for different codec types depend on the applicable version number.

Secondly, CRC protection for Extension_Blocks is essential for error detection. Extension_Blocks are protected by three CRC parity bits, generated using a degenerate cyclic code with the generator polynomial g(D) = D3 + D + 1. The encoding is performed systematically, and the parity bits are mapped to bits 16 to 18 in the Extension_Blocks.

Normative aspects of TFO in GSM, including AMR-WB, are detailed in Annex C of TS 28.062. These aspects ensure standardized operation and compatibility across different network elements.

The procedure for BTS to report codec information to BSC is defined in TS 48.058. This procedure allows the BTS to report codec information received from the remote BSS before or during TFO establishment. The BSC uses this information to resolve potential codec type and mode mismatches, ensuring seamless operation.

Finally, the definition and structure of Generic Configuration Frames for TFO are provided in Annex H of TS 28.062. These frames are crucial for configuring and managing TFO operations across different network elements, ensuring standardized communication and compatibility.","The answer must include details on the handling of TFO versions before and after REL-4, the specific version numbers and their precedence rules, the types of speech codecs supported, and the optional/mandatory features for different codec types. It should explain the CRC protection mechanism for Extension_Blocks, including the generator polynomial and encoding process. The normative aspects of TFO in GSM, including AMR-WB, should be covered. The procedure for BTS to report codec information to BSC and its importance in resolving codec mismatches should be described. Finally, the definition and structure of Generic Configuration Frames for TFO should be included."
"Describe the procedures and requirements for establishing and managing a Multi Party call in a 3GPP network, including the handling of users on hold and the configuration of internal Nb bearers.","The procedures for establishing and managing a Multi Party call in a 3GPP network involve several key steps and requirements. 

Firstly, the establishment of internal Nb bearers between the peripheral context and the Multiparty bridge context can be done using SIP-I or BICC protocols. If the Media Gateway (MGW) only supports SIP-I associated Nb, the procedures for establishing the internal Nb bearer follow the standard SIP-I based Nc external bearer setup procedures. This involves replacing the Establish Bearer, Prepare Bearer, Tunnel Information Up, and Tunnel Information Down procedures with Reserve RTP Connection Point, Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point, and Configure RTP connection point. If the MGW supports combinations of SIP-I and BICC associated Nb, the MSC Server (MSC-S) may establish the internal Nb bearer using either SIP-I based Nc or BICC based Nc external bearer setup procedures. The MSC-S determines the supported protocols through local configuration data.

For handling users on hold during conference establishment, specific signaling requirements must be followed. A Conference Progress (CPG) message to inform an active user of the conference establishment is encoded in a SIP INFO. For a user on hold, a CPG to inform them of the conference establishment is sent, and a CPG to retrieve the user on hold may also be sent. The retrieval of the user on hold can be combined with the conference call establishment in a single CPG. A re-INVITE message is sent to activate the held media. If only a CPG to inform the user on hold of the conference establishment is sent, the re-INVITE encapsulates this CPG. If a single CPG to inform and retrieve the user on hold is sent, the re-INVITE encapsulates this CPG. If separate CPGs are sent, the re-INVITE encapsulates the CPG to retrieve the user on hold, while the CPG to inform the user on hold is encapsulated in a SIP INFO.

The network model for Multi Party calls involves creating separate contexts for each call leg and the Multi Party bridge. Each party participating in the Multi Party conference is handled in a separate context representing the call leg between the Multi Party bridge and the participant. The Multi Party bridge itself is handled in a separate context to simplify interactions with other functionalities, such as handover. When the served mobile subscriber invokes a Multi Party service, the MSC server requests the MGW to create a separate context for the Multi Party bridge and seizes a bearer termination for each party in that context. Each call leg is represented by a separate context, and the MSC server requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections between the bearer terminations in the Multi Party bridge context and the call leg contexts using standard external bearer setup procedures.

Additionally, for the bearer independent CS core network, any out-of-band transcoder control applied for the call must be performed in accordance with the relevant 3GPP specifications.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The procedures for establishing internal Nb bearers, including the use of SIP-I and BICC protocols and the specific steps involved (Reserve RTP Connection Point, Configure RTP connection point).
- The signaling requirements for informing users about conference establishment, including the use of SIP INFO and re-INVITE messages.
- The network model for Multi Party calls, including the separation of contexts for each call leg and the Multi Party bridge.
- The handling of users on hold during conference establishment and retrieval.
- Any additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network and out-of-band transcoder control."
"Explain the conditions under which a GSM network may omit or postpone authentication and ciphering during call setup, and how the priority of the calling service subscriber is determined.","A GSM network may choose to omit or postpone authentication and ciphering to facilitate faster call setup. When the network decides to take this action, it sends a CM_SERV_ACC message in response to the CM_SERV_REQ message from the subscriber. This decision is typically made to expedite the call establishment process.

Regarding the priority of the calling service subscriber, authentication is performed according to standard mobile originated call procedures. The priority level of the subscriber can be determined by the GCR (Group Call Register) response. If the GCR response specifies a priority level, the subscriber is treated with that defined priority. If the GCR response does not provide a priority level, the subscriber is treated based on their selected priority or their default priority as known in the VLR (Visitor Location Register). The priority applicable to the voice group call channel or voice broadcast call channel is defined in the GCR.

In summary, authentication and ciphering may be performed, omitted, or postponed based on the network's decision to speed up call setup, and the priority of the calling service subscriber is determined by the GCR response, selected priority, or default priority in the VLR.","The answer should include the conditions under which a GSM network may omit or postpone authentication and ciphering, specifically for faster call setup. It should also cover the process of sending a CM_SERV_ACC message in response to a CM_SERV_REQ message. Additionally, the answer should explain how the priority of the calling service subscriber is determined, including the role of the GCR response, selected priority, and default priority known in the VLR. The relationship between authentication, ciphering, and priority should be clearly outlined."
"Describe the structure and components of the IMEI, IMEISV, and PEI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003.","The International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) is composed of three main elements: the Type Allocation Code (TAC), the Serial Number (SNR), and the Check Digit (CD). The TAC is an 8-digit code that identifies the type of mobile equipment. The SNR is a 6-digit code that uniquely identifies each equipment within the TAC. The CD is a single digit used to avoid manual transmission errors, calculated using the Luhn formula. The IMEI itself consists of 14 digits, with the CD being an additional digit not transmitted during IMEI checks.

The International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software Version Number (IMEISV) includes the same TAC and SNR components as the IMEI, but instead of a Check Digit, it has a Software Version Number (SVN) which is 2 digits long. The SVN identifies the software version of the mobile equipment. Security requirements for the IMEISV apply to the TAC and SNR but not to the SVN.

In 5GS, the Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI) identifies a User Equipment (UE) and can be one of several types: an IMEI, an IMEISV, a MAC address, or an IEEE Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64). The IMEI and IMEISV are defined as per their respective structures mentioned above. A MAC address is a 48-bit identifier defined in IETF RFC 7042, and an EUI-64 is used for UEs not supporting any 3GPP access technologies, defined in IEEE guidelines.","The answer should include a detailed description of the IMEI structure, specifying the TAC, SNR, and CD, and the purpose of the Check Digit. It should also describe the IMEISV structure, specifying the TAC, SNR, and SVN, and note the security requirements for IMEISV.

What are the key specifications and requirements for out of band emissions and adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) in E-UTRA as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101?,"The key specifications and requirements for out of band emissions and adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) in E-UTRA as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 are as follows:

1. **Out of Band Emissions**: These are unwanted emissions immediately outside the assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter, excluding spurious emissions. The out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and an Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR).

2. **Spectrum Emission Mask**: The spectrum emission mask of the User Equipment (UE) applies to frequencies starting from the edge of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth.

   - For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the CA E-UTRAACLR is the ratio of the filtered mean power centered on the aggregated channel bandwidth to the filtered mean power centered on an adjacent aggregated channel bandwidth at nominal channel spacing. Specific measurement bandwidths and conditions are provided in the relevant tables.
   - For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating band and the uplink active in two E-UTRA bands, the E-UTRAACLR is defined per carrier and the requirement is specified in the relevant subclause.
   - For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the E-UTRAACLR is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean powers centered on the assigned sub-block frequencies to the filtered mean power centered on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel spacing. Specific conditions apply if the sub-block gap bandwidth is smaller than the sub-block bandwidth.

4. **Power Limits for UE Emissions**: The power of any UE emission must not exceed the levels specified in the general E-UTRA spectrum emission mask. The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth, but it may be smaller to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, and efficiency.

5. **E-UTRAACLR Requirements**: 
   - The E-UTRAACLR is the ratio of the filtered mean power centered on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power centered on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel spacing. Specific measurement bandwidths and conditions are provided in the relevant tables.
   - For power class 2 capable UEs operating on Band 41, specific conditions apply based on the indicated P-max and uplink/downlink configuration.
   - For other supported frequency bands, the UE must meet all requirements for the default power class of the operating band and set its configured transmitted power as specified.

These specifications ensure that out of band emissions and adjacent channel leakage are controlled to minimize interference and maintain the integrity of the E-UTRA network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Definition and importance of out of band emissions and ACLR.
- Explanation of the spectrum emission mask and its application.
- Specific requirements for CA E-UTRAACLR in different carrier aggregation scenarios.
- Power limits for UE emissions as per the spectrum emission mask.
- Detailed requirements for E-UTRAACLR including conditions for different power classes and frequency bands."
Explain the different types of information elements and codeset shifting procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008.,"In 3GPP TS 24.008, information elements are categorized into four types: type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4. These types are associated with different formats, namely V (Value), LV (Length-Value), T (Tag), TV (Tag-Value), and TLV (Tag-Length-Value). The structure and organization of these information elements are designed to facilitate efficient communication and processing within the protocols of Radio Resources management, Mobility Management, and Call Control.

Type 1 and type 2 information elements are typically one octet in length, while type 3 and type 4 information elements can be longer and may include a length indicator. The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part of a message contains the Information Element Identifier (IEI). If the IEI is not recognized, the receiver determines the type of the information element and skips over unknown elements to analyze subsequent ones.

The order of appearance for information elements in a message is defined to ensure that elements with similar characteristics are grouped together. For example, type 1 information elements with 1/2 octet content are placed in succession, and spare bits are set to a specified value (usually 0) by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

Regarding codeset shifting procedures, there are 128 possible IEI values for type 3 and type 4 formats and at least 8 for type 1 and type 2 formats, totaling 133 available values. These values can be expanded into eight codesets, each containing 133 IEI values. Codeset 0 is the initially active codeset, and transitions between codesets can be made using locking or non-locking shift procedures.

The locking shift procedure permanently changes the active codeset to a higher numerical value, while the non-locking shift procedure temporarily shifts to a specified codeset for interpreting the next information element. After interpreting the next element, the original active codeset is resumed. Non-locking shift elements use type 1 format and are not considered errors if they indicate the current codeset.

Codeset 5 is reserved for national use, codeset 6 for local network-specific elements, and codeset 7 for user-specific elements. The mobile station and network must recognize shift information elements and determine the length of subsequent elements, even if they cannot interpret the content.

In summary, 3GPP TS 24.008 defines a structured approach to handling information elements and codeset transitions, ensuring efficient communication and compatibility across different protocols and network configurations.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The four types of information elements (type 1, 2, 3, 4) and their respective formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV).
  - The structure and organization of information elements, including how unknown elements are handled and the order of appearance in messages.
  - The concept of codesets and the number of possible information element identifier values.
  - The locking and non-locking shift procedures for codeset transitions, including the rules and examples of their application.
  - Specific details on the non-locking shift procedure, its temporary nature, and how it uses type 1 information elements."
Describe the requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD and TDD intra frequency cell reselection for Cat-NB1 UE in enhanced coverage as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521.,"The requirements and test parameters for HD-FDD and TDD intra frequency cell reselection for Cat-NB1 UE in enhanced coverage as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 are as follows:

1. **HD-FDD Intra Frequency Cell Reselection Requirements:**
   - Verification of HD-FDD intra frequency cell reselection requirements for Cat-NB1 UE is specified in clause 4.6.2.4.
   - Primary level settings including test tolerances for HD-FDD intra frequency cell reselection test case are defined in Tables 4.2.19.4.1-1, 4.2.19.5-1, and 4.2.19.5-2.
   - Specific test parameters for Ncell 1, Ncell 2, and Cell 1, Cell 2 are provided.
   - The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE camps on Ncell 2 and starts to send preambles on the NPRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Ncell 2. This delay shall be less than 66.32 seconds.
   - The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T3 to the moment when the UE camps on Ncell 1 and starts to send preambles on the NPRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Ncell 1. This delay shall be less than 21.12 seconds.
   - The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

2. **TDD Intra Frequency Cell Reselection Requirements:**
   - Primary level settings including test tolerances for E-UTRAN TDD intra frequency cell reselection test case are defined in Tables 4.2.36.5-1 and 4.2.36.5-2.
   - Specific test parameters for Ncell 1, Ncell 2, and Cell 1, Cell 2 are provided.
   - The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE camps on nCell 2 and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on nCell 2. This delay shall be less than 66.32 seconds.
   - The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the time from the beginning of time period T3 to the moment when the UE camps on nCell 1 and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on nCell 1. This delay shall be less than 21.12 seconds.
   - The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

For both HD-FDD and TDD intra frequency cell reselection test cases, the cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell can be expressed as Tdetect,NB_Intra_NB-IoT-EC + TSI, and to an already detected cell can be expressed as Tevaluate, NB_intra_NB-IoT-EC + TSI, where Tdetect and Tevaluate are specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 Table 4.6.2.4-1 in clause 4.6.2.4, and TSI is the maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell, assumed to be 8.32 seconds in these test cases.

The statistical pass/fail decisions are done separately for each event, and for an event to pass, the total number of successful loops shall be more than 90% of the cases with a confidence level of 95%.","The answer should include the verification requirements for HD-FDD intra frequency cell reselection for Cat-NB1 UE, the primary level settings and test tolerances for HD-FDD and TDD intra frequency cell reselection test cases, specific test parameters for Ncell 1, Ncell 2, and Cell 1, Cell 2, the defined cell reselection delay times for newly detectable and already detected cells, and the required rate of correct cell reselections."
Describe the registration and message reception processes for Non-MSGin5G UEs and Constrained UEs in the MSGin5G system.,"The registration and message reception processes for Non-MSGin5G UEs and Constrained UEs in the MSGin5G system involve several steps and pre-conditions to ensure proper connectivity and communication.

For Non-MSGin5G UEs, the registration process is facilitated through a Message Gateway. The pre-conditions for this process include:
1. The Message Gateway must be pre-provisioned with the MSGin5G Server address and UE Service ID for a Non-3GPP UE.
2. Both the Non-3GPP UE and Message Gateway must be configured with the necessary credentials for authentication and registration.
3. A secured connection must be established between the Message Gateway and the MSGin5G Server.

The registration process involves the following steps:
1. The Non-MSGin5G UE registers at the Message Gateway, or the registration information is pre-configured at the Message Gateway. The Message Gateway then registers the UE with the MSGin5G Server using the registration request and pre-provisioned information.
2. The Message Gateway sends the Non-MSGin5G UE registration request to the MSGin5G Server, including the necessary information.
3. The MSGin5G Server authenticates the Message Gateway and authorizes the Non-MSGin5G UE to receive MSGin5G services, recording the UE's availability.
4. The MSGin5G Server returns the registration result in the Non-MSGin5G UE registration response message.

For Constrained UEs, the message reception process uses the gateway UE functionality on MSGin5G UE-1. The pre-conditions for this process include:
1. MSGin5G UE-1 must be connected to an access network that provides connectivity to the MSGin5G Server.
2. UE-2, the Constrained UE, must be successfully registered with MSGin5G UE-1 acting as a gateway UE.

The message reception process involves the following steps:
1. MSGin5G Client-1 on UE-1 receives a message (Group, Point-to-Point, or Application-to-Point) for Application Client-2 on UE-2. MSGin5G Client-1 performs reassembly if the message is segmented and may perform segment recovery if needed.
2. Upon successfully receiving the message, MSGin5G Client-1 sends a message received request to Application Client-2 on UE-2, including the necessary information elements.
3. Application Client-2 on UE-2 sends a message received response to MSGin5G Client-1.
4. If delivery status is requested, Application Client-2 on UE-2 sends the message delivery status to MSGin5G Client-1.
5. MSGin5G Client-1 then sends the message delivery status report to the MSGin5G Server.

These processes ensure that Non-MSGin5G UEs and Constrained UEs can effectively register and receive messages within the MSGin5G system.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the registration process for Non-MSGin5G UEs, including the role of the Message Gateway and MSGin5G Server
  - Description of the pre-conditions required for registration
  - Detailed steps of the registration process, including the information exchanged between the Message Gateway and MSGin5G Server
  - Overview of the message reception process for Constrained UEs, including the role of MSGin5G UE-1 as a gateway
  - Description of the pre-conditions required for message reception
  - Detailed steps of the message reception process, including the information exchanged between MSGin5G Client-1 and Application Client-2
  - Explanation of the delivery status reporting mechanism"
"Describe the process and requirements for the NF service consumer to retrieve AKMA Application Key information from the AAnF, including the handling of errors and redirections.","To retrieve AKMA Application Key information from the AAnF, the NF service consumer must send an HTTP POST request to the AAnF. The request should use the URI '{apiRoot}/naanf-akma/<apiVersion>/retrieve-applicationkey' and include the AkmaAfKeyRequest data structure in the request body. If the request is for an anonymous user, the 'anonInd' attribute in the AkmaAfKeyRequest must be set to 'true'.

If the AAnF determines that the request needs to be redirected, it will send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of TS 29.500. If the AAnF encounters an internal error or an error in the request, it will respond with an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7, including a ProblemDetails data structure with the appropriate 'cause' attribute.

The AAnF must verify the presence of the UE-specific KAKMA key identified by the A-KID. If the KAKMA key is not present, the AAnF will respond with an HTTP '403 Forbidden' status code and a ProblemDetails data structure with the 'cause' attribute set to 'K_AKMA_NOT_PRESENT'. If the KAKMA key is present, the AAnF will process the request and respond with an HTTP '200 OK' status code, including the AkmaAfKeyData data structure in the response body. This structure will contain the KAF as the 'kaf' attribute, the KAF expiration time as the 'expiry' attribute, and the SUPI as the 'supi' attribute if the 'anonInd' attribute was not present or was set to 'false'.

If the requested AKMA Application Key information does not exist, the AAnF will respond with '204 No Content'. If the NF service consumer is an NEF and needs to relay the UE identifier to the AF based on local policy, the NEF will invoke the Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement service to translate the SUPI to a GPSI (External Id) and then include the GPSI in the response to the AF, as defined in TS 29.522. The NEF must not send the SUPI to the AF.","The answer should include the following key details:
- The specific HTTP POST request URI and the required request body structure (AkmaAfKeyRequest).
- Conditions for handling anonymous user requests.
- Steps for handling HTTP redirect responses and error responses, including specific status codes and the ProblemDetails data structure.
- Verification of the KAKMA key presence and the corresponding actions based on its presence or absence.
- The structure of the successful response, including attributes like KAF, expiry time, and SUPI.
- Handling of cases where the requested AKMA Application Key information does not exist.
- The role of NEF in translating SUPI to GPSI and relaying information to the AF."
Describe the handling and prioritization of CCNR and CCBS requests for a user who is both an originating and terminating party simultaneously.,"A user can be both an originating party and a terminating party simultaneously, meaning they can have activated the Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) service or the Completion of Communications on No Reply (CCNR) service and have outstanding CCNR or CCBS requests while also being the destination of CCNR or CCBS requests from other users. In such scenarios, CCNR and CCBS requests against the same terminating party are queued together in the same queue.

When a user receives a CCNR recall or CCBS recall as the originating party while their queue as the terminating party is being processed, the CCNR recall or CCBS recall takes priority over the handling of their queue. This means that the handling of CCNR and CCBS requests activated by the user as the originating party has priority over the handling of CCNR and CCBS requests activated by other users on this user as the terminating party.

If one of the user's CCNR requests can be processed, the user will receive a CCNR recall or notification, and the served user's terminating party idle guard timer, if running, will be cancelled. The processing of CCBS requests follows the requirements of the CCBS supplementary service.

If the network supports the option to retain CCNR requests, CCBS requests are also retained when a CCBS call encounters a busy destination. Additionally, if the network checks for identical requests in the user's queue, this check includes both CCNR and CCBS requests.

In cases where an originating party has a CCBS recall pending upon the arrival of a CCNR recall, it should be treated similarly to when the originating party is CCNR busy.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how a user can be both an originating and terminating party simultaneously.
  - Description of the queuing mechanism for CCNR and CCBS requests.
  - Details on the prioritization of CCNR and CCBS recalls for the originating party.
  - Steps involved in processing CCNR and CCBS requests when the user is both originating and terminating party.
  - Conditions under which CCBS requests are retained.
  - Network checks for identical requests in the user’s queue."
"Describe the conditions under which a Bearer activation event is generated and the elements delivered to DF2, referencing the relevant 3GPP specifications.","A Bearer activation event is generated under several specific conditions as outlined in the 3GPP specifications. According to TS 33.107 12.2.3.3, a bearer activation event is generated by the S-GW/PDN-GW when a bearer activation occurs. The elements delivered to the DF2, if available, include parameters related to the PDN type and address, EPS bearer QoS, and APN-AMBR, with specific notes on their applicability based on the success of the default bearer activation and the type of bearer (default or dedicated).

In TS 33.107 12.4.3.14, it is specified that a Bearer activation event is generated when an Initial attach in WLAN on GTP S2a or a Dedicated bearer activation in WLAN on GTP S2a is detected in the PDN-GW. The elements listed in clause 12.2.3.3 are delivered to the DF2 if available.

Similarly, TS 33.107 12.5.3.12 states that a Bearer activation event is generated when an Attach is handled by the ePDG over the GTP based S2b interface, a Dedicated bearer activation on the GTP based S2b interface is detected by the ePDG, or a Bearer activation is detected at the PDN-GW. Again, the elements listed in clause 12.2.3.3 are delivered to the DF2 if available.

The notes in clause 12.2.3.3 provide additional context:
- Note 1: The parameter includes both PDN type and PDN address(es) only in the case of default bearer activation.
- Note 2: In case of unsuccessful default bearer activation, the parameter carries the requested EPS bearer QoS; otherwise, it carries the EPS bearer QoS associated with the established bearer.
- Note 3: In case of unsuccessful default bearer activation, the parameter carries the subscribed APN-AMBR; otherwise, it carries the APN-AMBR used for the established bearer.
- Note 4: TFT is applicable only in the case of dedicated bearer.
- Note 5: Applicable only to ePDG and PDN-GW in the case of the S2b interface.
- Note 6: Void.

These conditions and elements ensure that the Bearer activation event is accurately generated and the relevant information is delivered to the DF2, facilitating proper network function and management.","The answer should include the specific conditions under which a Bearer activation event is generated according to each document. It should detail the elements delivered to DF2 as specified in clause 12.2.3.3, and include the notes on default bearer activation, unsuccessful default bearer activation, TFT applicability, and S2b interface. Additionally, it should clarify the different interfaces (S2a and S2b) and their relevance to the Bearer activation event."
"Describe the TEI assignment procedure on the A-bis interface as specified in TS 48.056, including any modifications to the automatic TEI assignment procedure from EN 300 125, part 2.","The TEI (Terminal Endpoint Identifier) assignment procedure on the A-bis interface, as specified in TS 48.056, includes several modifications to the automatic TEI assignment procedure from EN 300 125, part 2. 

Firstly, each TRX (Transceiver) is assigned a fixed TEI and may also be assigned additional TEIs for physical channels/layer 2 links. These layer 2 links can be turned on and off according to the normal automatic TEI assignment scheme, but the TRX can only request identified TEI values that are either semi-permanently programmed or programmed by operation and maintenance (O&M) messages.

For the first layer 2 link to a TRX, the automatic assignment procedure is modified as follows:
- The identity request must include an Ai value in the range of 0-63, identifying the TEI value requested for activation.
- Upon receiving the identity request message, the BSC (Base Station Controller) checks if the requested TEI can be used from a configuration perspective and then performs a normal TEI check procedure to prevent double assignment.
- If the TEI request is accepted, an identity assigned message with the requested TEI number is received by the TRX before the expiry of timer T202.
- If timer T201 expires, the request is repeated once, and timer T201 is restarted. If timer T202 expires, the assignment procedure is considered unsuccessful, and the TRX takes further actions as specified in EN 300 125, part 2.

In the case of an identity check response indicating that the requested TEI value is already in use, no answer is sent to the requesting TRX, and an error indication is sent to O&M.

The additional TEI assignment procedure is similar to the normal one, with two exceptions:
- The TEI value is in the range of 64-126.
- The TEI value and the identification of the physical link it will operate on are transmitted to the TRX from the BSC in an O&M message, which is transferred on an already assigned layer 2 link.

Regarding the messages used for TEI management procedures, all messages except Identity verify and Identity denied are used. The Ai parameter is used as described in clause 6.1.11.2, and the Ri parameter is not used and is always coded as 0000 0000.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the fixed TEI assignment for TRX and the possibility of additional TEIs.
  - Detailed description of the modifications to the automatic TEI assignment procedure for the first layer 2 link to a TRX, including the identity request and check procedure.
  - Steps involved in successful and non-successful assignment procedures, including timer operations (T201 and T202).
  - Description of the additional TEI assignment procedure, including the exceptions and the use of O&M messages.
  - Overview of the messages used for TEI management procedures, including the coding of Ai and Ri parameters."
How should an SGSN handle a GTP error indication message from different network elements according to 3GPP TS 23.007?,"According to 3GPP TS 23.007, the handling of a GTP error indication message by an SGSN varies depending on the source of the error indication:

- If the SGSN receives a GTP error indication from a GGSN, the SGSN is required to delete its PDP context and may notify the Operation and Maintenance network element. Additionally, it must send a Deactivate PDP Context Request message to the Mobile Station (MS) with the cause 're-activation required'.
  
- If the SGSN receives a GTP error indication from the Radio Network Controller (RNC), it should locally release the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) while preserving the associated PDP context. The SGSN may also initiate the RAB Assignment procedure to re-establish the RAB.

- For Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), when an Error Indication is received from an SGSN, the receiving GGSN must delete all information associated with the relevant SGSN in its MBMS Bearer Context and may notify the Operation and Maintenance network element. Additionally, for broadcast mode, the GGSN may request the re-establishment of the MBMS Bearer Context by sending an MBMS Session Start Request message. If the GGSN serves only one downstream SGSN for MBMS data transfer and does not support the re-establishment procedure, it must delete its MBMS Bearer Context along with the affected MBMS UE Context(s).","The answer should cover the following points: 
  - Actions taken by SGSN when receiving a GTP error indication from GGSN, including deletion of PDP context and notification to Operation and Maintenance network element, and sending Deactivate PDP Context Request to MS.
  - Actions taken by SGSN when receiving a GTP error indication from RNC, including local release of RAB and preservation of PDP context, and potential initiation of RAB Assignment procedure.
  - Actions taken by GGSN when receiving an Error Indication from SGSN for MBMS, including deletion of information associated with the relevant SGSN, notification to Operation and Maintenance network element, and potential re-establishment of MBMS Bearer Context."
"What are the requirements and configurations for supporting VR and interactive conversational services in a 5G system, based on the provided specifications?","To support VR environments and interactive conversational services in a 5G system, several requirements and configurations need to be met. 

For VR environments, the 5G system must support motion-to-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15 ms while maintaining a resolution of up to 8k, providing a user data rate of up to 1 Gbit/s. Additionally, the motion-to-sound delay should be less than 20 ms. Audio-video synchronization thresholds must be maintained within the range of 125 ms to 5 ms for audio delayed and 45 ms to 5 ms for audio advanced. These requirements ensure a seamless and immersive VR experience.

Specific use cases for VR include Cloud/Edge/Split Rendering, which involves the exchange of rendering data between the rendering server and device; Gaming or Training Data Exchanging, characterized by the exchange of service data between two 5G connected AR/VR devices; and consuming VR content via a tethered VR headset, which alleviates computation complexity by allowing decoding functionality to run locally at the connected UE.

For interactive conversational services, the 5G system must support low-delay speech coding with a one-way mouth-to-ear delay of 100 ms. The end-to-end delay budget for conversational audiovisual media should be less than 100 ms to 150 ms, including transport, processing, coding, and air interface delays.

System parameters for user interaction include 6DOF based on body/head movement and formats of rasterized video signals such as 2k x 2k at 60, 90, or 120 fps with YUV 4:2:0 encoding. Encoder configurations should use codecs like H.265/HEVC or optionally H.264/AVC, with rate control settings such as capped VBR and QP. Latency settings should prioritize minimal latency, with P pictures only and no look-ahead units.

Audio encoder configurations for both uplink and downlink should have a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz and an average data rate of 0.5 Mbps, with packet loss rates below 10e-3. Content delivery methods include sending eye buffers either at the same time or staggered, with RTP-based time codes and packet numbering for synchronization.

RAN configuration involves QoS settings for GBR, latency, and loss rate, along with HARQ handling and scheduling defined by the RAN group. Receiver configurations should include loss detection using sequence numbers, delay/latency handling by treating slices received after the deadline as lost, and error concealment by copying macroblocks for lost ones.

Overall, these requirements and configurations ensure that the 5G system can effectively support high-quality VR experiences and interactive conversational services.","The answer must include details on the latency requirements for VR environments, including motion-to-photon and motion-to-sound delays, and audio-video synchronization thresholds. It should also cover the specific use cases mentioned in Document 1. Additionally, the answer should detail the system parameters for user interaction, video and audio encoder configurations, content delivery methods, RAN configuration, and end-to-end delay budget for conversational audiovisual media as specified in Document 2."

"Explain the process and significance of the P and F bits in the 3GPP TS 27.010 standard, including how they are used for frame acknowledgment and error recovery.","In the 3GPP TS 27.010 standard, the P (Poll) and F (Final) bits play a crucial role in frame acknowledgment and error recovery. The P bit is set to 1 in command frames to request an acknowledgment, while the F bit is set to 1 in response frames to acknowledge the receipt of a command frame with the P bit set to 1. This exchange ensures that for every P bit set to 1, there is a corresponding F bit set to 1, and another P bit cannot be issued until the previous P bit has been matched with an F bit. Similarly, another F bit cannot be issued until another P bit is received.

The N(R) field in a received frame with a P or F bit set to 1 is used to detect the need for I frame retransmission. This capability, known as checkpointing, allows for early detection of I frames not received by the remote data station and indicates where retransmission should begin. The N(R) of a correctly received frame acknowledges previously transmitted I frames up to N(R) - 1 inclusive.

If a frame is received with an incorrect Frame Check Sequence (FCS), it is discarded. If an I frame is received with a correct FCS but an incorrect N(S) (Send Sequence Number), the receiving station ignores the N(S) field and discards the information field in that frame until the expected I frame is received correctly. However, the P/F and N(R) indications in the discarded I frames are still used for acknowledgment and error recovery.

Checkpointing, facilitated by the P and F bits, ensures that the receiving station can initiate appropriate error recovery if the N(R) does not acknowledge all I frames transmitted by the receiving station before and concurrent with the last frame transmitted with the P bit set to 1. This process helps maintain data integrity and efficient communication between stations.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the P and F bits in frame acknowledgment.
  - The rule that P and F bits are always exchanged as pairs and the implications of this rule.
  - The use of N(R) in frames with P or F bits set to 1 for detecting the need for I frame retransmission.
  - The process for handling frames with incorrect FCS and I frames with incorrect N(S).
  - The significance of checkpointing in error recovery and retransmission of I frames."
Describe the different types of RLC PDUs and their functions as specified in 3GPP TS 36.322.,"In 3GPP TS 36.322, the Radio Link Control (RLC) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are categorized into RLC data PDUs and RLC control PDUs, each serving distinct functions within the RLC sublayer.

RLC entities can operate in three modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and Acknowledged Mode (AM). Each mode has specific types of RLC data PDUs:

1. **TMD PDU (Transparent Mode Data PDU)**: Used by a TM RLC entity to transfer upper layer PDUs without adding any RLC headers, ensuring transparency in data transfer.

2. **UMD PDU (Unacknowledged Mode Data PDU)**: Utilized by a UM RLC entity to transfer upper layer PDUs. This mode does not provide retransmission, meaning it does not guarantee delivery.

3. **AMD PDU (Acknowledged Mode Data PDU)**: Employed by an AM RLC entity to transfer upper layer PDUs. This mode supports retransmission to ensure data delivery. The AMD PDU is used when transmitting the RLC SDU for the first time or when retransmitting without re-segmentation.

4. **AMD PDU Segment**: Used by an AM RLC entity when retransmitting a portion of an AMD PDU. This segmentation helps in efficient retransmission of only the lost parts of the data.

RLC control PDUs are specifically used by AM RLC entities to perform Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) procedures:

1. **STATUS PDU**: This control PDU is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity to inform its peer about the successfully received RLC data PDUs and those detected as lost. This feedback mechanism is crucial for the ARQ process, enabling the retransmission of lost PDUs.

In summary, RLC data PDUs (TMD, UMD, AMD, and AMD PDU segment) are primarily used to transfer upper layer PDUs, while RLC control PDUs (STATUS PDU) are used to manage the ARQ procedures, ensuring reliable data transfer in the AM mode.","The answer should include:
- A brief overview of RLC entities and their modes (TM, UM, AM).
- Description of RLC data PDUs: TMD PDU, UMD PDU, AMD PDU, and AMD PDU segment, including their specific functions.
- Explanation of RLC control PDUs, specifically the STATUS PDU and its role in ARQ procedures.
- Clarification on how RLC PDUs are used to transfer upper layer PDUs and perform ARQ procedures."
"Describe the process and conditions under which CFNRy information is passed from the HLR to the VLR, including the handling of different service states and formats.","The process and conditions under which Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy) information is passed from the Home Location Register (HLR) to the Visitor Location Register (VLR) involve several key steps and considerations based on the provisioning and registration states of CFNRy.

Firstly, if the provisioning state for CFNRy is 'Provisioned', the HLR sends the VLR information about the logical state of CFNRy for all relevant elementary basic service groups when the subscriber registers on a VLR. If the registration state for CFNRy is 'Registered', the HLR sends the VLR the registration parameters 'forwarded-to number' and 'no reply condition timer' for all relevant elementary basic service groups, along with information about subscription options such as 'notification to the calling party', 'notification to the forwarding party', and whether the MSISDN of the served subscriber can be presented to the forwarded-to subscriber.

When the logical state or registration parameters of CFNRy change while a subscriber is registered on a VLR, the HLR updates the VLR with the new information for the affected basic service groups. Similarly, if subscription options change while CFNRy is registered, the HLR informs the VLR of the new subscription options.

For Phase 1 VLRs, the HLR translates the service state information into a form that the VLR can accept based on the logical state held in the HLR. The translations are as follows:
1) (Provisioned, Not Registered, Not Active, Not Induced) => Erased, Deactivated;
2) (Provisioned, Registered, Not Active, Not Induced) => Registered, Deactivated;
3) (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Operative, Not Induced) => Registered, Activated;
4) (Provisioned, Registered, Active and Quiescent, Not Induced) => Registered, Deactivated.
Additionally, the HLR does not pass a subaddress to a Phase 1 VLR.

When dealing with VLRs that do not support CAMEL or support CAMEL Phase 1 only, the HLR sends the 'forwarded-to number' only if it is in an international format. If the 'forwarded-to number' is not in an international format, the HLR modifies the service state information of CFNRy to indicate that it is not registered, regardless of its actual state. This modification does not impact the service state information stored in the HLR. If the VLR supports Phase 1 updating of subscriber information only, the HLR performs a further translation of the service state information as defined for Phase 1 VLRs.

In summary, the process of passing CFNRy information from the HLR to the VLR involves careful consideration of the provisioning and registration states, the format of registration parameters, and the capabilities of the VLR, ensuring that the information is accurately and appropriately communicated.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of CFNRy provisioning and registration states and their impact on information sent from HLR to VLR.
  - Detailed description of parameters and subscription options sent by HLR to VLR when CFNRy is registered.
  - Process of updating VLR with new CFNRy state or parameters when changes occur.
  - Translation of service state information for Phase 1 VLRs and handling of 'forwarded-to number' in different formats.
  - Impact of modifications on service state information stored in HLR."

"Describe the encoding and handling of the 'Target ID' field in the context of SRNS relocation, handover procedures, and 5G-SRVCC as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274, TS 25.413, and TS 38.413.","The 'Target ID' field plays a crucial role in SRNS relocation, handover procedures, and 5G-SRVCC. The encoding and handling of this field are specified in various 3GPP documents.

In 3GPP TS 29.274, the 'Target ID' field is used for SRNS relocation procedures, handover to UTRAN, RAN Information Relay towards UTRAN or GERAN operating in GERAN Iu mode, and 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN procedure. The 'Target ID' field contains a non-transparent copy of the corresponding IEs and is encoded as specified. The 'Target RNC-ID' part of the 'Target ID' parameter is defined in 3GPP TS 25.413 and 3GPP TS 38.413. The ASN.1 parameter 'Target ID' is forwarded non-transparently to maintain backward compatibility. The coding of the location area code (LAC) and RNC-ID is the responsibility of each administration, using full hexadecimal representation. During a 5G-SRVCC handover, the AMF sets the RAC to a default value, such as hexadecimal 'FF', if it does not receive the target RAC. The MME_SRVCC ignores the received RAC value. The Extended RNC-ID, if included, consists of 2 octets and contains a 16-bit value within the range 4096 to 65535.

In 3GPP TS 29.274 clause 8.2.2, the document explains the transparent and non-transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters into GTPv2 IEs. Transparent copying involves copying the respective information into one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE without impacting GTPv2 if the contents of the RANAP/S1AP parameter change over time. Non-transparent copying involves decoding the ASN.1/PER parameter and encoding the values into the GTPv2 IE according to the specified guidelines.

In 3GPP TS 38.413 clause 9.3.1.25, the 'Target ID' IE identifies the target for handover procedures. This identification is crucial for ensuring the correct target is selected during handover processes.

Overall, the 'Target ID' field's structure and encoding, handling of RAC during 5G-SRVCC handover, differences between transparent and non-transparent copying of parameters, and its role in identifying the target for handover procedures are essential for maintaining seamless and efficient network operations.","The answer should cover the following key points:

What are the key parameters and formulas for calculating peak spectral efficiency and peak data rate in 3GPP TS 37.910?,"In 3GPP TS 37.910, the calculation of peak spectral efficiency and peak data rate involves several key parameters and formulas.

For peak spectral efficiency, the generic formula for both Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) for a specific component carrier (j-th CC) is given by:
\[ \text{Peak Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{R_{\text{max}} \times \text{Max Layers} \times \text{Max Modulation Order} \times \text{Scaling Factor}}{\text{Numerology} \times \text{Average OFDM Symbol Duration} \times \text{Max RB Allocation} \times (1 - \text{Overhead})} \]
where:
- \( R_{\text{max}} = 948/1024 \)
- Max Layers is the maximum number of layers for the j-th CC.
- Max Modulation Order is the maximum modulation order for the j-th CC.
- Scaling Factor can take values 1 and 0.75.
- Numerology is defined in TS 38.211.
- Average OFDM Symbol Duration is the average duration of an OFDM symbol in a subframe for the given numerology.
- Max RB Allocation is the maximum resource block allocation in bandwidth with numerology.
- Overhead is calculated as the average ratio of the number of resource elements (REs) occupied by control signals, synchronization signals, PBCH, reference signals, and guard periods with respect to the total number of REs in the effective bandwidth-time product.
- \( \alpha(j) \) is the normalized scalar considering the downlink/uplink ratio; for FDD \( \alpha(j) = 1 \) for both DL and UL; for TDD and other duplexing, \( \alpha(j) \) for DL and UL is calculated based on the DL/UL configuration.

For peak data rate, the formula as defined in Report ITU-R M.2410 is:
\[ \text{Peak Data Rate} = \sum_{j=1}^{Q} \left( W_j \times \text{SE}_{\text{pi}}(j) \times \alpha(j) \times \text{BW}(j) \right) \]
where:
- \( W_j \) is the effective bandwidth on component carrier j.
- \( \text{SE}_{\text{pi}}(j) \) is the spectral efficiency on component carrier j.
- \( \alpha(j) \) is the normalized scalar on component carrier j considering the downlink/uplink ratio; for FDD \( \alpha(j) = 1 \) for both DL and UL; for TDD and other duplexing, \( \alpha(j) \) for DL and UL is calculated based on the frame structure.
- \( \text{BW}(j) \) is the carrier bandwidth of component j.

Additionally, the document defines various periodicities and sleep ratios:
- SSB set periodicity, RMSI periodicity, and sleep ratios per slot and symbol basis are detailed in clause 5.8.1.

"Describe the procedures for data transfer on USCH and DSCH as outlined in the 3GPP TS 25.303 document, including the role of PhyShChAllocation and the configuration of Layer 1 and MAC.","The procedures for data transfer on USCH (Uplink Shared Channel) and DSCH (Downlink Shared Channel) as outlined in the 3GPP TS 25.303 document involve several key steps and components.

Firstly, the Radio Bearer (RB) establishment without Dedicated Physical Channel is explained. For some radio bearers, dedicated radio resources are not permanently associated, meaning the setup of physical resources is separate from the actual radio bearer setup, which involves only the Radio Link Control (RLC) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. The MAC can be initially configured to operate either on existing dedicated transport and physical channels or on common channels.

For data transfer on the USCH, the procedure assumes that the RB establishment has been performed using the RB Establishment procedure without Dedicated Physical Channel. The RB is mapped on the USCH and DSCH transport channels. The traffic measurement function in the User Equipment (UE) decides to send a Capacity Request to the network using the SHCCH (Shared Channel Control Channel) logical channel mapped on the RACH (Random Access Channel) or USCH. The USCH/DSCH scheduling function in the Controlling Radio Resource Control (C-RRC) will decide to allocate physical resources to this logical channel, and the RRC in the Controlling Radio Network Controller (C-RNC) sends a PhyShChAllocation message to its peer entity in the UE. This message specifies the physical resources and the period of time the MAC-c/sh (MAC control/shared) can transfer the data on the USCH transport channel. Both RRC in the CRNC and the UE configure their respective Layer 1 and MAC for the data transfer on the USCH, and at the specified time, MAC-c/sh in the UE conveys the data using the specified PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel) resources. This operation may be repeated several times until the RLC buffer is empty. Additionally, the PhyShChAllocation may allocate PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) resources, allowing the RRC in the CRNC and the UE to configure their respective Layer 1 and MAC for data transfer on the DSCH, and MAC-c/sh in the C-RNC conveys the acknowledgement message of the UTRAN RLC to its UE peer entity using the specified PDSCH resources. Transmitting the acknowledgement message via FACH (Forward Access Channel) is also possible.

For data transfer on the DSCH, the procedure similarly assumes that the RB establishment has been performed using the RB Establishment procedure without Dedicated Physical Channel. The RB is mapped on the USCH and DSCH transport channels. The USCH/DSCH scheduling function in the C-RRC will decide to allocate physical resources in the downlink, and the RRC in the C-RNC sends a PhyShChAllocation message to its peer entity in the UE using SHCCH mapped on the FACH or DSCH. This message specifies the physical resources and the period of time the MAC-c/sh can transfer the data on the DSCH transport channel. Both RRC in the CRNC and the UE configure their respective Layer 1 and MAC for the data transfer on the DSCH, and at the specified time, MAC-c/sh in the C-RNC conveys the data using the specified PDSCH resources. This operation may be repeated several times until the RLC buffer is empty. Additionally, the PhyShChAllocation may allocate PUSCH resources, allowing the RRC in the CRNC and the UE to configure their respective Layer 1 and MAC for data transfer on the USCH, and MAC-c/sh in the UE conveys the acknowledgement message of the UE to its C-RNC peer entity using the specified PUSCH resources. Transmitting the acknowledgement message via RACH is also possible.

In summary, the procedures for data transfer on USCH and DSCH involve the initial RB establishment without Dedicated Physical Channel, the sending of Capacity Requests, the allocation of physical resources via PhyShChAllocation messages, and the configuration of Layer 1 and MAC for data transfer using PUSCH and PDSCH resources. These operations may be repeated until the RLC buffer is empty.","The answer should cover the following key points:

Describe the security mechanisms used for signalling and user-plane traffic between MS and SGW over the Up interface as specified in TS 43.901 5.3.2.,"The security mechanisms for signalling and user-plane traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Serving Gateway (SGW) over the Up interface, as specified in TS 43.901 5.3.2, involve the use of an IPsec tunnel. This tunnel provides mutual authentication using SIM credentials, encryption, and data integrity. 

Authentication is achieved through several mechanisms:
- The MS and SGW use IKEv2 to establish IPsec security associations.
- Public key signature-based authentication with certificates is used to authenticate the SGW.
- EAP-SIM within IKEv2 is used to authenticate the MS.
A profile for IKEv2 is defined in TS 33.234, sub-clause 6.5.

"Describe the interworking procedures for originating calls in the IM CN subsystem as specified in 3GPP TS 29.292, focusing on call waiting notifications and communication diversion notifications.","The interworking procedures for originating calls in the IM CN subsystem as specified in 3GPP TS 29.292 involve handling both call waiting notifications and communication diversion notifications.

For call waiting notifications, when an originating call is interworked to the IM CN subsystem and the MSC Server receives a 180 Ringing response with an Alert-Info header field set to 'urn:alert:service:call-waiting' according to 3GPP TS 24.615, the MSC Server must follow specific procedures. According to 3GPP TS 24.083, the MSC Server should send an ALERTING message as the carrier message for the Call Waiting notification if possible. If sending an ALERTING message is not feasible, the MSC Server should instead send a FACILITY message as the carrier message for the Call Waiting notification.

For communication diversion notifications, if a served user with the subscription option 'Originating user receives notification that his communication has been diverted (forwarded or deflected)' experiences communication diversion, the MSC Server must handle the situation as follows. Upon receiving a 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded) response, if a History-Info header field is present and any history entry contains a 'cause' SIP URI parameter set to a value listed in table 5.6.6.3.2.1, the MSC Server should send a FACILITY message containing a NotifySS operation indicating the call has been forwarded. The NotifySS operation must include an SS-Code as specified in 3GPP TS 24.082 and 3GPP TS 24.072, mapped from the value of the last 'cause' SIP URI parameter according to table 5.6.6.3.2.1.

It is important to note that, as per 3GPP TS 24.604, the History-Info header field can also be received in a SIP 180 (Ringing) or SIP 200 (OK) response to the initial SIP INVITE request. However, no interworking is performed in these scenarios because 3GPP TS 24.082 does not allow this information to be presented to the subscriber in a manner consistent with 3GPP TS 24.604.","The answer should include:

Describe the support and key functionalities of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) in E-UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 36.300.,"Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) in E-UTRAN support radio access for different types of User Equipment (UEs), including BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage, and NB-IoT UEs. These networks utilize various orbits and platforms such as Geosynchronous Orbits (GSO), Non-Geosynchronous Orbits (NGSO) including Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and High Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS).

The NTN payload facilitates connectivity by transparently forwarding the radio protocol received from the UE to the NTN Gateway and vice versa. It supports multiple connectivity options where an eNB can serve multiple NTN payloads, and an NTN payload can be served by multiple eNBs. The NTN payload may change the carrier frequency before retransmitting it on the service link and vice versa.

Three types of service links are supported in NTN:
1. Earth-fixed: Beams continuously cover the same geographical areas (e.g., GSO satellites).
2. Quasi-Earth-fixed: Beams cover one geographic area for a limited time and another area at a different time (e.g., NGSO satellites with steerable beams).
3. Earth-moving: Beams' coverage area slides over the Earth's surface (e.g., NGSO satellites with fixed or non-steerable beams).

eNBs operating with NGSO satellites can provide quasi-Earth-fixed or Earth-moving cell coverage, while those with GSO satellites can provide Earth-fixed or quasi-Earth-fixed cell coverage.

E-UTRAN uses several identities to identify network entities, including:
- Globally Unique MME Identity (GUMMEI)
- E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI)
- eNB Identifier (eNB ID)
- Global eNB ID
- Tracking Area Identity (TAI)
- CSG Identity (CSG ID)
- EPS Bearer ID / E-RAB ID
- NR Cell Global Identifier (NCGI)
- en-gNB Identifier (en-gNB ID)
- Global en-gNB ID

In NTN, only BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage, and NB-IoT UEs with GNSS capability are supported. To accommodate long propagation delays, increased timer values, window sizes, or delayed starting times are supported for both the physical and higher layers. UL segmented transmission is supported for UL transmission with repetitions, and UEs apply pre-compensation per segment of UL transmission.

NTN is applicable only to FDD systems in this release of the specification.","The answer should include the types of UEs supported over NTN, the types of orbits and platforms used for NTN, the connectivity options for NTN payloads, the types of service links, and the cell coverage provided by eNBs.

"What are the requirements and procedures for radio link monitoring and reporting for Category M1 UEs as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521, TS 36.133, and TS 36.331?","The requirements and procedures for radio link monitoring and reporting for Category M1 UEs are detailed across several 3GPP documents, including TS 36.521, TS 36.133, and TS 36.331.

Firstly, the applicability of these requirements extends beyond Category M1 UEs to include Category M2 and non-BL/CE UEs, although the wording is pending further discussion in RAN4.

For Category M1 UEs configured with rlm-ReportConfig, the UE must estimate the downlink radio link quality and compare it to the thresholds QE1_out_CatM1 and QE2_in_CatM1. The threshold QE1_out_CatM1 is defined as the level at which the downlink radio link cannot be reliably received, corresponding to a 10% block error rate of a hypothetical MPDCCH transmission with specified parameters. Conversely, QE2_in_CatM1 is the level at which the downlink radio link quality can be significantly more reliably received, corresponding to a 2% block error rate of the same hypothetical transmission.

When the downlink radio link quality of the PCell estimated over the last TEvaluate_Qout_CatM1 period becomes worse than QE1_out_CatM1, Layer 1 of the UE must send an out-of-sync indication to higher layers within the evaluation period. Similarly, if the quality improves over the TEvaluate_Qin_CatM1 period to better than QE2_in_CatM1, an in-sync indication must be sent. These indications are filtered through Layer 3 as specified in TS 36.331.

The evaluation periods TEvaluate_Qout_CatM1 and TEvaluate_Qin_CatM1 are typically 5*rmax*G ms, provided certain conditions are met, such as rmax*G being at least 80 ms, G being greater than 1, and the UE not receiving PDSCH. If these conditions are not met, the periods default to 400 ms and 200 ms, respectively.

Additionally, when the downlink radio link quality becomes worse than QE1_out_CatM1, the UE must trigger event E1 and send a report to higher layers within the evaluation period. Conversely, when the quality improves to better than QE2_in_CatM1, event E2 must be triggered, and a report sent. These events are also filtered through Layer 3 as specified in TS 36.331.

Specific procedures for out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations of the PCell are detailed in TS 36.521, while transmitter power management after the expiry of the T310 timer is covered in TS 36.331. The normative references for these requirements are found in TS 36.133.

In summary, the procedures involve estimating downlink radio link quality, comparing it to defined thresholds, sending appropriate indications and reports, and managing transmitter power, all while adhering to specified evaluation periods and conditions.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the applicability of the requirements to different UE categories.

Describe the process and information elements involved in the Session with QoS revoke operation between the EAS and the EES as per 3GPP TS 23.558.,"The Session with QoS revoke operation between the EAS (External Application Server) and the EES (External Exposure Server) involves several steps and specific information elements. 

Firstly, the EAS requests a revoke of the data session with QoS between the AC (Application Client) and the EAS. This request must include the Context ID. The EES then checks if there is a context for the provided Context ID and whether the EAS is authorized to perform this operation. If the EAS is authorized, the EES unsubscribes from the PDU session status monitoring (if applicable) and invokes the Policy Authorization Delete service or AF Session with QoS Revoke service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively). This action deletes the application session context at the PCF or NEF and removes the subscription to any session with QoS event notifications. If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure occurs, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.

The information elements required for a Session with QoS revoke request from the EAS to the EES are detailed in Table 8.6.6.3.6-1. Similarly, the information elements required for a Session with QoS revoke response from the EES to the EAS are described in Table 8.6.6.3.7-1.

"Describe the MBMS multicast service activation procedure, including the key steps and messages exchanged between the UE, SGSN, and GGSN.","The MBMS multicast service activation procedure is designed to register the user in the network to enable the reception of data from a specific multicast MBMS bearer service. This procedure involves several key steps and messages exchanged between the User Equipment (UE), Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), and Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN).

1. **Activation of PDP Context**: The UE activates a general purpose PDP context if one is not already established.
2. **Signaling Interest**: The UE sends an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Join message over the default PDP context to signal its interest in receiving a particular multicast MBMS bearer service identified by an IP multicast address.
3. **Authorization Request**: The GGSN sends an MBMS Authorization Request to seek authorization for the activating UE to receive data. The authorization decision, which may be based on subscription data in the BM-SC, is provided in the MBMS Authorization Response. If the UE is not authorized, the process terminates.
4. **Notification Request and Response**: The GGSN sends an MBMS Notification Request to the SGSN, which includes the IP multicast address and APN. The SGSN responds with an MBMS Notification Response indicating whether the MBMS context activation will proceed.
5. **Context Activation Request**: The SGSN sends a Request MBMS Context Activation to the UE, requesting it to activate an MBMS UE Context.
6. **Context Creation by UE**: The UE creates an MBMS UE context and sends an Activate MBMS Context Request to the SGSN, including the IP multicast address, APN, MBMS_NSAPI, and MBMS bearer capabilities.
7. **Verification and Notification Reject**: If the SGSN determines that the UE's MBMS bearer capabilities are insufficient, it sends a MBMS Notification Reject Request to the GGSN, terminating the procedure.
8. **Security Functions**: Security functions may be performed to authenticate the UE.
9. **Trace Activation**: If trace is activated, the SGSN sends an Invoke Trace message to the BSS or RAN.
10. **Context Creation by SGSN**: The SGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context Request to the GGSN.
11. **Authorization and Registration**: The GGSN sends another MBMS Authorization Request to the BM-SC, and if necessary, a MBMS Registration Request. The BM-SC allocates a TMGI if needed and responds with MBMS Bearer Context information.
12. **Context Creation by GGSN**: The GGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context Response to the SGSN.
13. **Final Context Activation**: The SGSN sends an Activate MBMS Context Accept message to the UE, including the TMGI. If the UE's MBMS bearer capabilities were not verified earlier, they are verified now.

Explain the IMD order calculations and their implications for different CA band combinations as per the 3GPP TS 38.717 and TR 38.862 documents.,"The IMD (Intermodulation Distortion) order calculation is crucial for understanding the potential interference in carrier aggregation (CA) band combinations. The formula for calculating the IMD order is given by:

IMD order = 2 * ceil(WGap / Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth)) + 1

Where:
- WGap is the frequency gap between the lowest band edge of the higher band and the highest band edge of the lower band.
- Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth) is the minimum value between the maximum uplink aggregated bandwidth and the uplink band bandwidth.

Let's break down the IMD order calculations for different CA band combinations as mentioned in the documents:

1. **CA_n28-n79**:
   - WGap = 4400 MHz (lowest band edge of n79) - 803 MHz (highest DL band edge of n28) = 3597 MHz
   - Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth) = Min(200 MHz, 600 MHz) = 200 MHz
   - IMD order = 2 * ceil(3597 / 200) + 1 = 37
   - Since the IMD order is greater than 11, MSD (Minimum Separation Distance) can be ignored.

2. **CA_n3+n78**:
   - For contiguous UL CA:
     - WGap = 3300 MHz (lowest band edge of n78) - 1880 MHz (highest DL band edge of n1) = 1420 MHz
     - Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth) = Min(200 MHz, 500 MHz) = 200 MHz
     - IMD order = 2 * ceil(1420 / 200) + 1 = 17
     - Since the IMD order is greater than 11, MSD can be ignored.
   - For non-contiguous UL CA:
     - WGap = 3300 MHz (lowest band edge of n78) - 1880 MHz (highest DL band edge of n1) = 1420 MHz
     - Min(maxBW separation class, UL band bandwidth) = Min(600 MHz, 500 MHz) = 500 MHz
     - IMD order = 2 * ceil(1420 / 500) + 1 = 7
     - Since the IMD order is less than 9, MSD due to IMD7 cannot be ignored.

3. **CA_n78+n1**:
   - WGap = 3300 MHz (lowest band edge of n78) - 2170 MHz (highest DL band edge of n1) = 1130 MHz
   - Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth) = Min(200 MHz, 500 MHz) = 200 MHz
   - IMD order = 2 * ceil(1130 / 200) + 1 = 13
   - Since the IMD order is greater than 11, MSD can be ignored.

4. **CA_n79+n3**:
   - WGap = 4400 MHz (lowest band edge of n79) - 1880 MHz (highest DL band edge of n3) = 2520 MHz
   - Min(maxUL aggregated BW, UL band bandwidth) = Min(200 MHz, 600 MHz) = 200 MHz
   - IMD order = 2 * ceil(2520 / 200) + 1 = 27
   - Since the IMD order is greater than 11, MSD can be ignored.

In summary, the IMD order calculation helps determine whether MSD can be ignored based on the value of the IMD order. If the IMD order is greater than 11, MSD can be ignored, indicating minimal interference. However, if the IMD order is less than 9, MSD cannot be ignored, suggesting potential interference issues. Additionally, harmonic and harmonic mixing issues have been analyzed and found to be non-problematic for the specified CA band combinations.","The answer should include the following key details:

Describe the Carrier Aggregation (CA) specific test configuration and nominal channel spacing as defined in 3GPP TS 36.141.,"The Carrier Aggregation (CA) specific test configuration in 3GPP TS 36.141 is constructed on a per band basis using a detailed method. The process involves selecting component carrier combinations supported by the Base Station (BS) based on the sum of their channel bandwidths. The combinations with the smallest and largest sums are chosen for testing. If multiple combinations have the same sum, the selection criteria include the narrowest carrier at the lower and upper BS RF Bandwidth edges, the smallest number of component carriers, and the widest carrier adjacent to the lowest or highest carrier. This process is repeated until only one combination remains. The nominal carrier spacing defined in subclause 5.7.1A is applied.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is determined by the deployment scenario, the size of the frequency block available, and the channel bandwidths. It is calculated using the formula: Nominal Channel spacing = (BWChannel(1) + BWChannel(2))/2, where BWChannel(1) and BWChannel(2) are the channel bandwidths of the two respective E-UTRA carriers. This spacing can be adjusted to optimize performance in specific deployment scenarios. For 20MHz carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply to both 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz nominal carrier spacing.","The answer must include:

The purpose of the test is to verify that the ME informs the SIM that a language selection event has occurred using the ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD - LANGUAGE SELECTION) command. 

Initial conditions for the test include connecting the ME to a SIM Simulator, ensuring the elementary files are coded as SIM Application Toolkit default, powering on the ME, performing the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure, and setting the current language to English with another supported language, such as German.

The procedure involves a sequence of commands and responses:
1. The ME sends a PROACTIVE COMMAND: SET UP EVENT LIST to the SIM, indicating the language selection event.
2. The SIM responds with a TERMINAL RESPONSE: SET UP EVENT LIST, confirming the command was performed successfully.
3. The ME then sends an EVENT DOWNLOAD - LANGUAGE SELECTION command to the SIM, specifying the selected language (e.g., German).

Describe the procedures and conditions under which a VLR sends notifications to the gsmSCF during Mobility Management events.,"During Mobility Management events, the Visitor Location Register (VLR) plays a crucial role in managing and updating subscriber information. When a location update or data restoration is requested, the VLR indicates to the Home Location Register (HLR) which CAMEL phases it supports and which CAMEL phase 4 CAMEL Subscription Information (CSI) can be downloaded. Based on this indication, the HLR sends the appropriate CAMEL subscription data to the VLR.

After the location update is completed, the Mobile Switching Center (MSC)/VLR checks the Mobility Management CAMEL Subscription Information (M-CSI) for the subscriber. If the M-CSI indicates that a Mobility Management notification to the gsmSCF is required, the MSC/VLR sends the notification accordingly. The contents of the M-CSI specify the conditions under which such notifications should be sent.

Various Mobility Management procedures can trigger the need for a notification to the gsmSCF. These procedures include:
- Location updates within a single VLR service area, which may be in the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) or the Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN).
- Location updates from one VLR service area to another, within the same HPLMN or VPLMN.
- Location updates between different PLMNs, including updates from HPLMN to VPLMN, VPLMN to HPLMN, and between different VPLMNs.
- IMSI detach procedures, which can be explicit (when the mobile station is switched off by the subscriber) or implicit (when the network assumes the mobile station is switched off or unreachable due to lack of periodic paging updates).
- IMSI attach procedures, which occur when the mobile station is switched on by the subscriber and subscription data is still available in the VLR, negating the need for a location update.

It is important to note that the sending of a Mobility Management notification to the gsmSCF is independent of other CAMEL subscription data for the subscriber. For example, a subscriber may have M-CSI without having Originating CAMEL Subscription Information (O-CSI) or Visiting CAMEL Subscription Information (VT-CSI). The processing of the Mobility Management event in the VLR is not suspended or affected by the sending of the notification to the gsmSCF.","The answer should include the following key points:

"What are the requirements for including an 'ETag' header in HTTP responses according to TS 29.504, and how does it facilitate conditional requests?","According to TS 29.504, the 'ETag' (entity-tag) header should be included in HTTP responses that carry representations of cacheable or modifiable resources. This header is essential for enabling conditional requests. For cacheable resources, the 'ETag' allows an NF Service Consumer to perform conditional GET requests using the 'If-None-Match' header. For modifiable resources, it facilitates conditional POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests using the 'If-Match' header. The 'ETag' must contain a server-generated strong validator, which ensures that the value can be matched with the resource representation stored in the server or cache.

Compare the test requirements for event-triggered reporting in E-UTRAN FDD and TDD configurations under non-DRX conditions based on CRS discovery signals.,"The test requirements for event-triggered reporting in E-UTRAN FDD and TDD configurations under non-DRX conditions based on CRS discovery signals share several similarities and differences. 

For both FDD and TDD configurations, the measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that triggers a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. The actual overall delays measured in the tests may be up to 2×TTIDCCH higher than the measurement reporting delays due to TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

In the case of Event A6, the overall delays measured test requirement is expressed as:
Overall delays measured = measurement reporting delay + insertion uncertainty
Where:
measurement reporting delay = Tidentify_scc_SCE
For both FDD and TDD, Tidentify_scc_CRS is calculated as 13 * measCycleSCell + Tmeasure_scc_CRS, where Tmeasure_scc_CRS = 3 * measCycleSCell and measCycleSCell = 320 ms. This results in Tidentify_scc_CRS = 5120 ms. The UE must send one Event A6 triggered measurement report with a measurement reporting delay of less than 5122 ms from the beginning of time T2, including 2 ms for insertion uncertainty.

For Event A2, the overall delays measured test requirement is expressed as:
Overall delays measured = measurement reporting delay + insertion uncertainty
Where:
measurement reporting delay = Tmeasure_scc_CRS
For both FDD and TDD, Tmeasure_scc_CRS is calculated as 3 * measCycleSCell, resulting in 960 ms. The UE must send one Event A2 triggered measurement report for Cell 2 with a measurement reporting delay of less than 962 ms from the beginning of time T3, including 2 ms for insertion uncertainty.

In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurements of the primary component carrier must meet all applicable requirements in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.6.2.1. For FDD, TMeasurement_Period intra_FDD_CRS is 3 * TDMTC_periodicity = 480 ms, and for TDD, TMeasurement_Period intra_TDD_CRS is also 480 ms.

The UE must not send event-triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled. The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95% for each event. The statistical pass/fail decisions are done separately for Event A6 and Event A2. The test is considered passed if both events A6 and A2 are passed; otherwise, the UE fails.

In summary, while the fundamental principles and calculations for measurement reporting delays and overall delays are consistent between FDD and TDD configurations, the specific measurement periods and cycles are tailored to each configuration. Both configurations require high statistical confidence levels for pass/fail criteria, ensuring reliable event-triggered reporting performance.","Key details the answer must include:

"Describe the process of ProSe direct services authorization update and revocation in both non-roaming and roaming scenarios, as per 3GPP TS 23.303 specifications.","The process of ProSe direct services authorization update and revocation involves several steps and interactions between different network entities, as outlined in the 3GPP TS 23.303 specifications.

For authorization updates triggered by the HSS (Home Subscriber Server):
1. The ProSe related subscription data is updated, such as the authorization for ProSe direct discovery service. The HSS sends a Subscription Data Updated Notify message to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN (Home Public Land Mobile Network). This message may add or remove PLMNs from the allowed PLMN list for ProSe direct service. The updated ProSe data includes an indication and optionally a PLMN ID. If the PLMN ID is not included, the authorization update applies to all PLMNs. The ProSe Function in HPLMN updates the associated ProSe UE context if it has been stored before.
2. The UE (User Equipment) receives the updated authorization for ProSe direct service via the ProSe Service Notification message immediately or waits until the next communication with the ProSe function in HPLMN, depending on the operator's policy.

"Describe the process and handling of CDRs by the CGF, including the treatment of erroneous CDRs and the indication of lost CDRs.","The Charging Gateway Function (CGF) is responsible for collecting Call Detail Records (CDRs) from the Charging Data Function (CDF). If the CDF and CGF are separate entities, the standard Ga interface is used for transferring CDRs. If they are integrated, a proprietary mechanism is employed. CDRs are transferred in near real-time from the CDF to the CGF as soon as they are closed by the CDF.

Once received by the CGF, CDRs undergo semantical and syntactical checks. If a CDR is found to be incorrectly formatted, the CGF replaces defective parameters with appropriate indicators within the allowed syntax limits. If the error is irrecoverable, such as a corrupted 'CDR type' attribute, the CGF cannot process the CDR further. Acceptable CDRs, either error-free or corrected, are placed into a CDR file, while non-acceptable CDRs are logged, alarms are generated, and they may be destroyed. The number of lost CDRs should be indicated in the CDR file.

The CGF must process received CDRs immediately, complying with near real-time requirements. Once a CDR is stored, any other reference to it may be destroyed.

Regarding lost CDRs, the 'lost CDR indicator' parameter specifies if and how many CDRs were lost during processing. The encoding is as follows:
- MSB bit '0', all other bits '0': no CDRs lost.
- MSB bit '0', other bits set to 1-126: a number of CDRs corresponding to the lower 7 bits were lost, unknown if more were lost.
- MSB bit '0', all other bits '1': 127 or more CDRs lost, unknown if more were lost.
- MSB bit '1', all other bits '0': CDRs lost, number unknown.
- MSB bit '1', other bits set to 1-126: number of lost CDRs indicated by lower 7 bits.

"Describe the process and commands involved in deleting SMS or CBS messages from the MT store, including the responses and information elements related to the deletion process.","The process of deleting SMS or CBS messages from the MT store involves several steps and specific commands. The TE (Terminal Equipment) initiates the deletion process by sending a DELETE MESSAGE command to the MT (Mobile Terminal). This command is used to request the deletion of a specific SMS or CBS message held in the MT and includes a message reference, which is defined by the MT and provided in the message list.

Upon receiving the DELETE MESSAGE command, the MT attempts to delete the specified message. If the deletion is successful, the MT sends a DELETE MESSAGE COMPLETE indication back to the TE. If the deletion fails, the MT sends a DELETE MESSAGE FAILURE indication instead.

When a message is successfully deleted, the MT re-assigns the Page Index and Index Count to ensure that their values are contiguous, meaning there are no gaps in either parameter. The original short message reference values remain unchanged.

The Index Count is an 8-bit number that identifies the number of short message indices contained in a MESSAGE LIST response from the MT to the TE. It is coded with bit 8 of octet 2 being the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 2 being the least significant bit.

The Page Index indicates which Page of SMS Indices is required to be transferred and is also used to indicate to the TE which Page of SMS Indices is being transferred. The Page Index can have a value from 1 to 51, with bit 6 of octet 2 being the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 2 being the least significant bit. If the Page Index field has a value of 0 or a value greater than 51, the receiving entity will return an 'Unable to Process' response with the cause 'Command Not Understood'.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Explain the process and considerations for maintaining and re-establishing TFO (Tandem Free Operation) in a 3GPP network, particularly during handovers and synchronization loss.","Maintaining and re-establishing Tandem Free Operation (TFO) in a 3GPP network involves several key processes and considerations. 

Firstly, a TRAU (Transcoder and Rate Adaptation Unit) in TFO established mode continuously monitors synchronization with its peer TRAU entity. If synchronization is lost, a timer is started. Once this timer elapses, the TRAU sends normal PCM speech, reverts to non-TFO mode, and initiates re-establishment procedures to restore TFO (Document 1).

During handovers, different scenarios can impact TFO. In the case of a handover involving modification of the TRAU on one side or a change of transcoder DSP, TFO will be interrupted and re-established if the newly allocated TRAU is TFO capable. The newly allocated TRAU starts in normal mode and attempts to establish TFO immediately, which may cause the synchronization loss timer to elapse at the original TRAU, reverting it to normal mode. TFO will then be re-established by the new TRAU. For intra-cell and inter-cell handovers without modification of transcoder DSP, the management of TFO depends on the speed of the handover. If the handover is fast enough to prevent the synchronization loss timer from elapsing, TFO is maintained; otherwise, there is a fallback to regular tandem, with attempts to re-establish TFO if both TRAUs are still TFO-capable (Document 2).

Additionally, TFO capable TRAUs must be able to interact with non-TFO capable TRAUs without noticeable degradation of quality. The TFO establishment protocol defines timers for various processes, such as negotiation message transmission and declaring synchronization loss. These timers must be consistent between both TRAUs to allow TFO establishment. Given that TRAUs may be located in different PLMNs and manufactured by different companies, most timers need to be initialized with pre-defined values to ensure compatibility (Document 3).","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The continuous monitoring of synchronization by the TRAU and the actions taken when synchronization is lost, including the use of a timer and reversion to non-TFO mode.
  - The different handover scenarios and their impact on TFO, including the conditions under which TFO is interrupted or maintained.
  - The need for TFO capable TRAUs to interact seamlessly with non-TFO capable TRAUs, the importance of consistent timer settings for TFO establishment, and the initialization of these timers with pre-defined values to ensure compatibility across different PLMNs and manufacturers."

The frequencies to be tested are specified according to Annex E table E-1 and TS 36.508 clauses 4.4.2 and 4.3.1, with a channel bandwidth of 10MHz. The setup involves connecting the SS (node B emulator) and AWGN noise sources to the UE antenna connectors as illustrated in TS 36.508 Annex A figures A.14 and A.78a, depending on the UE's RF band capabilities. General test parameters are outlined in Table 5.1.43.4.1-1, and propagation conditions are set according to Annex B clause B.0. The test includes two E-UTRA FDD carriers with one cell on each carrier, where Cell 1 is used for connection setup with power levels defined in Annex C.0 and C.1.

"Describe the procedures and message sequences involved in setting up a CS network originating session with forking, including the handling of alerting messages and through-connection configurations.","Setting up a CS network originating session with forking involves several procedures and message sequences. 

Firstly, the message sequence chart for a CS network originating session setup with ISUP where forking occurs is illustrated in Figure 39a of TS 29.163. This chart provides a detailed example of how messages are exchanged during the session setup process, including the handling of multiple branches due to forking.

Upon receiving the first 180 Ringing response, the MSC Server is required to send an ALERTING message towards the UE. This procedure is outlined in TS 29.292 5.3.4, ensuring that the UE is notified of the incoming call.

Interworking at the MSC server follows the basic call interworking procedures, which include support for the P-Early-Media header field and related procedures. These requirements are detailed in TS 29.292 5.6.9, 5.6.9.3, and 5.6.9.4, emphasizing the importance of handling early media during call setup.

Additionally, configuring the CS-MGW for through-connection involves specific procedures. If the MSC Server wants to configure the CS-MGW so that the bearer will be through-connected in the backward direction, it must use the Change Through-Connection procedure or the Configure the RTP Connection Point procedure during the Prepare Bearer and Reserve Circuit procedures, as defined in TS 29.232. For both-way through connection, the MSC Server should use the Change Through-Connection procedure during the Prepare IP bearer procedure, as outlined in TS 29.292 7.1.5.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in creating, terminating, and notifying network resource reservations for V2X applications as specified in 3GPP TS 29.486.","The process of managing network resource reservations for V2X applications involves several key steps, including creating, terminating, and notifying network resource adaptations. 

1. **Creating 'Individual Application Requirement'**:
   - The NF service consumer, such as a V2X application-specific server, initiates the creation of an 'Individual Application Requirement' by sending an HTTP POST request. This request includes the ApplicationRequirementData data structure in the payload body.
   - The ApplicationRequirementData must contain the following attributes:
     - Either the V2X Group ID within the 'groupId' attribute or the V2X UE ID within the 'ueId' attribute.
     - Notification URI within the 'notifUri' attribute.
     - Service ID within the 'serviceId' attribute.
     - V2X application requirement within the 'appRequirement' attribute.
     - Optionally, the duration within the 'duration' attribute.
   - Upon receiving the POST request, the VAE Server performs authorization based on the provided information. If successful, the server creates a new resource representing the 'Individual Application Requirement' and responds with a 201 Created message. This response includes a Location header containing the URI for the created resource.
   - The NF service consumer uses this URI for subsequent requests to refer to the 'Individual Application Requirement'.

2. **Resource URI Format**:
   - The resource URI for the 'Individual Application Requirement' follows the format: {apiRoot}/vae-app-req/<apiVersion>/application-requirements/{requirementId}. This format supports the resource URI variables defined in the relevant table.

3. **Terminating 'Individual Application Requirement'**:
   - To terminate a network resource reservation, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request. The VAE Server checks if the resource identified by the URI exists. If it does, the server deletes the resource and responds with a 204 No Content message.
   - If errors occur during the processing of the DELETE request, the VAE Server applies error handling procedures.

4. **Notifying Network Resource Adaptation Results**:
   - When the VAE Server receives the result of network resource adaptation from the SEAL NRM server, it sends an HTTP POST request to the notification URI provided by the NF service consumer. The request body includes the AppReqNotification data structure with:
     - The resource URI of the individual Application Requirement related to the notification within the 'resourceUri' attribute.
     - The result of the network resource adaptation within the 'result' attribute.
   - Upon successful processing of the POST request, the NF service consumer responds with a 204 No Content message. If errors occur, the VAE Server sends an HTTP error response.

5. **Error Handling Procedures**:
   - Error handling procedures for both HTTP POST and DELETE requests are specified in the relevant clauses. These procedures ensure that any issues during the request processing are appropriately managed.

Overall, the process involves careful coordination between the NF service consumer and the VAE Server, with specific steps and attributes required for creating, terminating, and notifying network resource reservations for V2X applications.","The answer must include:

Describe the procedures and requirements for handling 'Predefined ROI' mode in IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW as specified in 3GPP TS 23.334 and TS 26.114.,"The 'Predefined ROI' mode in IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW involves several specific procedures and requirements as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.334 and TS 26.114. 

Firstly, if the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW support the 'Predefined ROI' mode, they must follow the procedures specified in the relevant clauses. When the IMS-ALG receives an SDP body containing an 'a=rtcp-fb' line with the 'Predefined ROI' type expressed by the parameter '3gpp-roi-predefined', it must forward the SDP body with unmodified 'a=rtcp-fb' lines to the succeeding node. Additionally, the IMS-ALG must include the 'Predefined ROI' information element when seizing resources in the IMS-AGW to request the assignment of resources for the corresponding RTCP control flow.

The IMS-AGW is then responsible for assigning resources for the requested RTCP control flow and transparently forwarding the RTCP 'FB ROI' packets between the incoming and outgoing network. The procedures described in clause 5.9 also apply, which include handling multiple RTCP packet types within the RTCP control flow.

If the IMS-ALG receives an SDP body containing the predefined ROI attribute(s) 'a=predefined_ROI', it must forward the SDP body with unmodified predefined ROI attribute(s) for both send and receive directions when seizing or modifying resources in the IMS-AGW.

Furthermore, if the IMS-ALG receives an SDP body containing 'a=extmap' attribute(s) with the predefined ROI URN(s) (e.g., 'urn:3gpp:predefined-roi-sent'), it must include the 'Extended RTP header for Sent ROI' information element when seizing resources in the IMS-AGW. The IMS-ALG must also forward the SDP body with unmodified 'a=extmap' attribute(s) to the succeeding node.

The IMS-AGW, when instructed to pass on the extended RTP header for predefined ROI, must handle the RTP header extension appropriately. If the IMS-AGW does not apply video transcoding, it should pass any received RTP header extension for Predefined ROI to succeeding RTP streams. If video transcoding is applied, the IMS-AGW must keep the predefined ROI information unchanged during transcoding and copy the received RTP header extension for Predefined ROI to the succeeding outgoing RTP stream(s) after transcoding the associated group of packets.

These procedures ensure that the predefined ROI information is correctly handled and transmitted across the network, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the video streams.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW in supporting 'Predefined ROI' mode.
  - The specific SDP attributes involved ('a=rtcp-fb', 'a=predefined_ROI', 'a=extmap') and their handling.

  - The handling of RTCP control flows and RTP header extensions.
  - The impact of video transcoding on predefined ROI information."
"Describe the operations supported by the VAE_SessionOrientedService service and the procedures involved in establishing, updating, and terminating a session-oriented service.","The VAE_SessionOrientedService service supports the following operations: Establish_Session, Notify_Establish_Session, Update_Session, Notify_Update_Session, Terminate_Session, and Notify_Terminate_Session.

To establish a session-oriented service, the NF service consumer (e.g., V2X application specific server) sends an HTTP POST request to create an 'Individual Session Oriented Service Subscription'. The request must include the SessionOrientedData data structure with attributes such as notification URI (notifUri), remote V2X UE ID (ueId), V2X service ID (serviceId), identity of the V2X application specific server (appSerId), and application QoS requirements (appQosReq). Upon successful authorization, the VAE Server creates the resource and responds with a 201 Created message, including the URI for the created resource. The VAE Server then invokes the procedure to establish the session-oriented service with the VAE client.

To update a session-oriented service, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP PUT request to update the 'Individual Session Oriented Service Subscription'. The request must include the SessionOrientedData data structure, ensuring that the remote V2X UE ID, V2X service ID, and identity of the V2X application specific server remain unchanged. Upon successful authorization, the VAE Server updates the resource and responds with either a 200 OK or 204 No Content status code. The VAE Server then invokes the procedure to update the session-oriented service with the VAE client.

To terminate a session-oriented service, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request to delete the 'Individual Session Oriented Service Subscription'. Upon successful authorization, the VAE Server deletes the resource and responds with a 204 No Content status code. The VAE Server then invokes the procedure to terminate the session-oriented service with the VAE client.

"Describe the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193, including the steps involved and the conditions under which the procedure can be performed.","The network-initiated Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurement procedure, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193, is designed to enable the User Plane Function (UPF) to measure the PLR of downlink (DL) traffic to the User Equipment (UE) over an access of a Multi-Access (MA) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) session. This procedure can only be performed when there are user-plane resources on the access of the MA PDU session. It can be applied to the Quality of Service (QoS) flow of either the default QoS rule or the non-default QoS rule. For the non-default QoS rule, the Session Management Function (SMF) must provide the UE with QoS rules that include downlink-only or bidirectional packet filter matching the Service Data Flow (SDF) to be measured, unless reflective QoS is used during the PDU session establishment or modification procedure.

The network-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of two main components:
1. Network-initiated PLR count procedure.
2. Network-initiated PLR report procedure.

The steps involved in the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure are as follows:
1. The UPF sends a PMFP PLR count request message to the UE. If the measurement is for the SDF over a QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule, the message is transported over the non-default QoS flow; otherwise, it is transported over the default QoS flow.
2. Upon sending the PMFP PLR count request message, the UPF starts counting the transmitted DL packets over the QoS flow.
3-4. The UE starts counting the received DL packets over the QoS flow upon receiving the PMFP PLR count request message and sends a PMFP PLR count response message to the UPF. The UE determines the QoS Flow Identifier (QFI) either from the header of the received DL packet or by evaluating the QoS rules if no QFI is included in the header.
5-7. The UPF sends a PMFP PLR report request message to the UE to report the number of counted DL packets. If the UPF intends to request the UE to restart counting, it includes an indication in the message and restarts counting the transmitted DL packets.
8-10. The UE stops counting the DL packets upon receiving the PMFP PLR report request message and sends a PMFP PLR report response message with the number of counted DL packets. If the UE accepts the restart indication, it restarts counting the received DL packets.
11. The UPF calculates the DL packet loss rate based on the local count of transmitted DL packets and the reported count of received DL packets. If the restart indication is not accepted by the UE, the UPF aborts the restart of the measurement procedure.

The procedure ensures that all PMFP messages are transported over the same QoS flow on the same access of the MA PDU session. The network cannot initiate another PLR measurement procedure over the same QoS flow until the current procedure is completed. If the UPF requests and the UE accepts the restart of counting, multiple occurrences of certain steps can happen.

In summary, the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure involves coordinated actions between the UPF and UE to count and report DL packets, ensuring accurate measurement of packet loss rates under specified conditions.","The answer must include the following key details: 
  - The purpose of the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure.

"Explain the optional support for PCC rule versioning and media component versioning in 3GPP specifications, including the procedures and attributes involved.","In 3GPP specifications, the support for PCC rule versioning and media component versioning is optional, meaning that it is not mandatory for all implementations but can be supported if required by operator policies.

For PCC rule versioning, when the 'RuleVersioning' feature is supported, the Session Management Function (SMF) and the Policy Control Function (PCF) must comply with specific procedures. The PCF assigns a content version to each generated PCC rule and includes this version in the 'contVer' attribute within the PccRule data structure. Upon modification of a PCC rule, the PCF assigns a new content version and includes all related content. If only certain attributes within the PCC rule need modification, the PCF includes the new content version along with all applicable attributes. The content version remains unique for the lifetime of the PCC rule. The SMF, when reporting PCC rules provisioned with a content version, includes the 'contVers' attribute in the RuleReport data structure for each corresponding PCC rule. This ensures proper installation and handling of previous rule versions.

For media component versioning, when the 'MediaComponentVersioning' feature is supported, the Application Function (AF) and the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) must follow specific procedures. The AF assigns a content version to the media component related to a service and provides this version within the Content-Version AVP as part of the Media-Component-Description AVP. Upon modification of a media component, the AF assigns a new content version and includes all related content. The content version remains unique for the lifetime of the media component. The PCRF, upon receiving the Content-Version AVP, follows procedures described in other 3GPP specifications and includes the content version in notifications to the AF.

Similarly, the Network Function (NF) service consumer and the PCF must comply with procedures when supporting media component versioning. The NF service consumer assigns a content version to the media component and provides this version to the PCF in the 'contVer' attribute within the 'medComponents' attribute. The PCF then follows the procedures described in the relevant 3GPP specifications.

Overall, the optional support for PCC rule versioning and media component versioning involves specific attributes ('contVer', Content-Version AVP, Media-Component-Description AVP) and roles of SMF, PCF, PCRF, and NF service consumer. These procedures ensure proper installation and handling of modifications, taking into account operator policies and previous interactions.","The answer should cover the optional nature of PCC rule versioning and media component versioning, the specific attributes involved ('contVer', Content-Version AVP, Media-Component-Description AVP), the roles of SMF, PCF, PCRF, and NF service consumer, and the procedures for assigning and reporting content versions. It should also mention the operator policies and the importance of including all content related to modifications to ensure proper installation and handling of previous interactions."
Describe the procedure for discovering FLUS Source capabilities and list the properties that can be retrieved.,"The procedure for discovering FLUS Source capabilities involves a message exchange between the Remote Controller function and the Remote Control Target of the FLUS Source. The sequence diagram for this procedure is illustrated in Figure 5.3.2.11-1. The steps are as follows: 

1. The Remote Controller function sends a FLUS Source capability request to the Remote Control Target of the FLUS Source.
2. The Remote Control Target responds with a list of FLUS Source capabilities.

The FLUS Source capabilities that can be retrieved are specified in clause 5.3.5 and include the following properties:

- Available video format(s)
- Available audio format(s)
- Available ancillary stream format(s) such as subtitles/captions and content metadata
- Connectivity options, including RAN and wired systems
- Remote control types, which can be manual, remote, or none, and the specific system used
- Mobility types, which can be fixed, on foot, ground vehicle, airborne vehicle, surface water vehicle, or underwater
- Power options, which can be battery, battery with autonomous charging, or mains

The Remote Controller function uses the FLUS Source capability discovery message exchange to retrieve these capabilities and the current status of the FLUS source device. The status is returned in the form of the capabilities of the FLUS source populated with the applicable settings to indicate the current state of the corresponding parameter. For example, the current media format being transmitted or the current charge level and estimated operating time when running on battery power. When charging, the charge level and estimated time to full charge could be indicated.

Additionally, the answer should explain how the current status of these properties is indicated, including examples of specific settings and auxiliary information."
What are the key elements and their values specified in TS 24.483 and TS 24.484 for mission critical data services?,"The key elements and their values specified in TS 24.483 and TS 24.484 for mission critical data services are as follows:

1. **TimeTempDataWaiting**: This element is defined in TS 24.483 clause 11.2.7 and represents the time limit for temporarily stored data waiting to be delivered to a receiving user. The values for this element range from 0 to 65535 minutes.

2. **TimePeriodicAnnouncement**: This element is defined in TS 24.483 clause 11.2.8 and represents the timer for periodic announcements containing a list of available recently invited data group communications. The values for this element also range from 0 to 65535 minutes.

3. **MCDataOneToOneCallSignalling**: This element is defined in TS 24.483 clause 11.2.11 and represents the priority values for MCData user data in one-to-one call signalling. The values range from 1 to 8, with the lowest value indicating the highest priority among the MCData user data.

4. **MCDataOneToOneCallMedia**: This element is defined in TS 24.483 clause 11.2.12 and represents the priority values for MCData user data in one-to-one call media. Similar to the signalling element, the values range from 1 to 8, with the lowest value indicating the highest priority.

5. **NotificationServer**: This element is defined in TS 24.483 clause 11.2.16 and is part of the OnNetwork configuration. It contains the hostname of the notification server.

TS 24.484 provides mappings of various service configuration parameters to the elements specified in TS 24.483. These mappings include:

Describe the frequency bands and test system requirements for UTRA/TDD as specified in the document.,"UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in several frequency bands for both uplink and downlink transmission. These bands include: 1900 - 1920 MHz, 2010 - 2025 MHz, 1850 - 1910 MHz, 1930 - 1990 MHz, 1910 - 1930 MHz, 2570 - 2620 MHz, 2300 - 2400 MHz, and 1880 - 1920 MHz. Deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not precluded.

Regarding the test system requirements, the maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified for each test, with all tolerances and uncertainties being absolute values valid for a confidence level of 95%. This means that the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval contains 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment. For RF tests, the uncertainties apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include system effects due to mismatch between the Device Under Test (DUT) and the Test System.

Measurement results returned by the Test System are compared against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk principle. The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for each parameter must be included in the test report and must be equal to or lower than the specified values. If the Test System has a measurement uncertainty greater than specified, it is permitted to use this equipment provided that an adjustment is made to tighten the Test Requirement, making the test harder to pass. This ensures that a non-compliant Test System does not increase the chance of passing a device that would otherwise fail.

Additionally, the critical parameters of the components of an overall Test System, such as signal generators and signal analyzers, are specified in Annex C. These parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the overall Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System Calibration.","The answer should include the specific frequency bands for UTRA/TDD operation, the acceptable uncertainty levels for the Test System, the confidence level for measurements, the Shared Risk principle, and the adjustments required for non-compliant Test Systems. Additionally, it should cover the critical parameters of Test Equipment necessary for compliance."
Describe the procedures involved in handling Floor Request decisions and modifying media properties in the context of 3GPP TS 23.333 specifications.,"The handling of Floor Request decisions and the modification of media properties in the context of 3GPP TS 23.333 involves several key procedures and roles, primarily between the Media Resource Function Controller (MRFC) and the Media Resource Function Processor (MRFP).

1. **Requesting and Reporting Floor Request Decisions**:
   - The MRFC requests the MRFP to notify the decision of a Floor request using the 'Floor Decision Request' procedure. The MRFP then reports the outcome of the Floor Request (statuses: 'Granted', 'Released', or 'Revoked') using the 'Report Floor Status Decision' procedure. This information is crucial for the MRFC to decide how to set the media properties of the associated Termination/Stream on the MRFP. The MRFP indicates the Floor Identity or Identities associated with the decision and sends one notification per Floor decision for a given termination, ensuring only one notification per termination is outstanding at any time.

2. **Modifying Media Properties**:
   - Upon receiving the Floor Request Decision from the MRFP, the MRFC modifies the media properties associated with the decision using the 'Modify Media' procedure. If the status is 'Granted', permissions are added; if 'Revoked' or 'Released', permissions are removed. The MRFC then confirms the successful modification of media properties to the MRFP using the 'Confirm Media Update' procedure. The MRFP subsequently modifies the Floor status of the associated client.

3. **Involvement of Floor Participants and Floor Chair**:
   - A Floor Participant may request one or more Floors by sending a BFCP request message to the MRFP (FCS). The MRFP informs the Floor Chair, if present, about the request. The Floor Chair then sends the decision to the MRFP, or if the Floor is not Chair-controlled, the MRFP makes the decision itself according to the Floor Control Algorithm. The MRFP notifies the MRFC of the decision via the 'Report Floor Request Decision' procedure. The MRFC then requests the MRFP to modify the media properties based on the decision and confirms the update using the 'Confirm Media Update' procedure. Additionally, the MRFC may request the MRFP to play tones or announcements to indicate when a user gains or loses Floor permissions.

These procedures ensure a structured and efficient process for handling Floor Request decisions and modifying media properties, involving clear communication and defined roles between the MRFC and MRFP, as well as the Floor Participants and Floor Chair.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The roles of MRFC and MRFP in requesting and reporting Floor Request decisions.
  - The statuses 'Granted', 'Released', or 'Revoked' and their implications.
  - The procedures for modifying media properties based on Floor Request decisions.
  - The confirmation process for media updates.
  - The involvement of Floor Participants and the Floor Chair in the decision-making process.
  - The sequence of procedures as outlined in the relevant clauses and figures from the documents."
"Describe the procedure for MCData server initiated communication release in both one-to-one and group communication scenarios, including the information flow and pre-conditions.","The procedure for MCData server initiated communication release in both one-to-one and group communication scenarios involves several pre-conditions and steps, as well as specific information flows for communication release requests and responses.

Pre-conditions:
1. MCData users on MCData client 1, client 2, and client 3 are already registered for receiving MCData service.
2. A MCData administrator has configured the limits for the maximum amount of data and time that a participant transmits from a single request to transmit.
3. An ongoing MCData communication exists between MCData client 1, client 2, and client 3.

Steps involved in the communication release procedure:
1. The MCData server decides to release the ongoing MCData communication, identified by a conversation identifier, due to one or more release conditions being met (e.g., lack of capacity, exceeding the limit for the maximum amount of data or time that a participant transmits from a single request to transmit).
2. The MCData server identifies the participants of the ongoing MCData communication and generates a communication release request to release the ongoing communication.
3. The MCData server sends the communication release request to each participant of the MCData communication.
4. MCData users are notified about the release of the MCData communication.
5. Each MCData client involved in the communication sends a communication release response back to the MCData server.
6. All participants of the MCData communication successfully release the media plane resources associated with the communication that is released.

Information flow for communication release request:
- For one-to-one communication, the information flow is described in Table 7.7.2.1.8-1.
- For group communication, the information flow is described in Table 7.7.2.1.10-1.

Information flow for communication release response:

Describe the events and information elements related to 'Cancel Location' and 'SMS over NAS' as specified in the 3GPP TS 33.107 documents.,"The 'Cancel Location' event is used to report to DF2 when the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) sends a cancel location or purge to the serving system. This event includes elements such as the old serving system of the target. For IoT User Equipment (UE), the 'Cancel Location for IoT UE' event is equivalent to the standard 'Cancel Location' event but is specifically for targets supporting Non-IP Data Delivery using the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF). The information elements for this event are delivered to DF2 if available.

SMS over NAS uses the Mobility Management Entity (MME) as an Interception Control Element (ICE). The applicable events for SMS over NAS include the 'SMS over NAS Report'. For separate delivery of SMS when the NAS infrastructure is used, the MME reports events to the DF, including 'SMS over NAS' and various HSS related events such as 'Serving Evolved Packet System', 'HSS subscriber record change', 'Cancel Location', 'Register Termination', 'Register location', and 'Location information request'.

For SMS-MO (Mobile Originated), the event is generated in the MME when it receives the SMS from the target Mobile Station (MS) or detects that an SMS is to the Non-Local ID target. For SMS-MT (Mobile Terminated), the event is generated in the MME when it receives the SMS originated from a Non-Local ID target or when the recipient MS has received the SMS successfully. The recipient MS is the target MS when the SMS is sent to the target, but may not be the target when the SMS originates from a Non-Local ID target. These elements are delivered to DF2 if available.","The answer should cover the following key points:

"Describe the attributes related to tracing a home subscriber in HLR as defined in TS 52.008, including their syntax, behavior, and possible values.","The attributes related to tracing a home subscriber in HLR as defined in TS 52.008 include the following:

1. **IMSI**: This attribute is the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the object tracedHomeSubscriberInHlr and defines an IMSI to be traced. It will be an IMSI of a home subscriber for whom tracing is required. The syntax is defined in MAP-CommonDataTypes IMSI.

2. **traceActivatedInVlr**: This single-valued attribute indicates the status of the trace. Possible values are True and False. Initially, this attribute is set to False. If the subscriber is registered and roaming within the HPLMN, the attribute is set to TRUE upon positive confirmation from the VLR. If the subscriber roams to an area where tracing is not possible, the attribute is set to FALSE. Each status change triggers an attributeValueChange notification. The syntax for this attribute is Trace-DataTypes.TraceStatus, and its behavior is defined as per TS 52.008 clause 5.5.1.2.1.

3. **traceReference**: This attribute is a unique reference for a particular trace associated with a specific IMSI and is allocated by the OSF.

4. **traceType**: This attribute describes the invoking events for which the operator wishes to collect a trace record for a particular IMSI in an MSC or BSS. It also describes the type of record to be collected and indicates whether or not this is a priority trace.

5. **hlrTraceType**: This attribute describes the type of trace record (if any) the operator wishes to be collected in the HLR for a particular IMSI. It is assumed for all invoking events.

6. **operationSystemId**: This attribute contains the address of the OSF to which the operator wishes the trace records associated with this particular IMSI to be sent. If EFDs are used, trace records are sent to OSFs defined in EFD.

7. **mapErrorOnTrace**: This single-valued, read-only attribute is set by MAP and contains the MAP-Errors that may be returned in the confirm primitives of the ActivateTraceMode and DeactivateTraceMode Operations.

Describe the power control mechanisms and requirements for GSM transmitters as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.,"The power control mechanisms and requirements for GSM transmitters as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 include several key aspects:

1. **General Power Control Requirements and Steps of Power Reduction**: The output power can be reduced by steps of 2 dB. The reference level of 0 dB corresponds to the output power level according to subclause 4.1.

2. **Conditions for Transmitter in Idle Mode**: When the transmitter is in idle mode, it must respect the conditions outlined in subclause 4.3.3.

3. **Detailed Power Control During Burst Transmission**: The transmitted power level relative to time when sending a burst is shown in annex B. In multislot configurations where bursts in two or more consecutive time slots are transmitted at the same frequency, the template of annex B must be respected during the useful part of each burst and at the beginning and end of the series of consecutive bursts. The output power during the period between the useful parts of every two consecutive active timeslots must not exceed the level allowed for the useful part of the first timeslot, or the level allowed for the useful part of the second timeslot plus 3 dB, whichever is higher.

4. **Residual Output Power Levels**: Between active bursts, the residual output power must be maintained at or below the level of:
   - -59 dBc or -54 dBm, whichever is greater for GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850, and GSM 700, except for the time slot preceding the active slot, for which the allowed level is -59 dBc or -36 dBm, whichever is greater.
   - -48 dBc or -48 dBm, whichever is greater for DCS 1800 and PCS 1900.

5. **Measurement Bandwidth**: A measurement bandwidth of at least 300 kHz is assumed.

6. **Exceptions for High Timing Advance**: In the case of a normal burst being transmitted with a high timing advance immediately after an access burst, a minimum of 8.25 symbol guard period is allowed for the MS power ramping, and the useful part requirements for the concerned bursts are allowed to be adjusted correspondingly.

7. **Timing of Transmitted Burst**: The timing of the transmitted burst is specified in 3GPP TS 45.010.","The answer must include the general power control requirements and steps of power reduction, conditions for transmitter in idle mode, detailed power control during burst transmission including multislot configurations, residual output power levels, measurement bandwidth, exceptions for high timing advance, and timing of transmitted burst."
"Explain the process and considerations for steering a UE from EPC to 5GC, including the role of 5G Preferred Network Behaviour and the information exchanged between the UE and the network.","The process of steering a User Equipment (UE) from the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to the 5G Core (5GC) involves several steps and considerations. The Mobility Management Entity (MME) plays a crucial role in this process. One of the key actions the MME can take is to reject the Control Plane Service Request with an appropriate cause value, effectively steering the UE from EPC. Before doing so, the MME must consider the availability of 5GC to the UE and the UE's Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour.

During registration, the UE signals its 5G Preferred Network Behaviour, which includes information about the network behaviours it can support and its preferences. This information is conveyed through the 5GMM Capability Information Element (IE) and other IEs. The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour includes whether the UE supports Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, N3 data transfer, and header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. Additionally, the UE indicates its preference for either Control Plane or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.

The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) uses the 5G Preferred Network Behaviour information to indicate the network behaviours it supports in the 5G Supported Network Behaviour information. This indication is specific to the Registered Area and may include support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, N3 data transfer, and header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. If both the UE and AMF indicate support for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF will communicate this support to the Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN).

For Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) UEs that only support Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF must include support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in the Registration Accept message. UEs supporting NB-IoT will always indicate support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, while UEs supporting Wideband Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (WB-E-UTRA) will always indicate support for N3 data transfer.

The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour indication from the UE can influence policy decisions, potentially causing the rerouting of the Registration Request from one AMF to another. This ensures that the network can optimize its operations based on the capabilities and preferences of the UE, leading to more efficient and effective network management.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of the MME in steering the UE from EPC to 5GC.
  - The conditions under which the MME may reject the Control Plane Service Request.
  - The factors the MME must consider before steering the UE, including the availability of 5GC and the UE's Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour.
  - The information included in the 5G Preferred Network Behaviour signalled by the UE during registration.
  - How the AMF uses the 5G Preferred Network Behaviour to indicate supported network behaviours and influence policy decisions.
  - The implications of the UE's and AMF's indicated support for various optimizations and data transfer methods on the network's behavior and decisions."
"Describe the process and key elements involved when the NF service consumer (AUSF) confirms the occurrence of a successful or unsuccessful authentication in a serving network to the UDM, as outlined in TS 29.503 5.4.2.3.2.","The process begins with the NF service consumer (AUSF) sending a POST request to the resource representing the UE's authentication events. The payload body of this POST request must contain a representation of the individual AuthEvent resource to be created. This AuthEvent resource includes the UE's identity (supi) and information about the authentication occurrence (AuthEvent), with the serving network identified by servingNetworkName. There should be only one individual AuthEvent per UE per Serving Network.

Upon receiving the POST request, the UDM processes it and responds accordingly. If the authentication event is successfully recorded, the UDM responds with a '201 Created' status code, and the 'Location' header in the response will contain the URI of the created resource. If the authentication event fails to be recorded, the UDM responds with an appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error, along with additional error information to help diagnose the issue.","The answer should detail the POST request process, including the payload body containing the AuthEvent resource, the identification of the UE by supi, and the serving network by servingNetworkName. It should also cover the UDM's response, specifying the '201 Created' status and URI on success, and the error status code and information on failure."
Describe the rules and parameters for RAN-assisted WLAN interworking as defined in 3GPP TS 25.304.,"RAN-assisted WLAN interworking involves specific rules and parameters that UEs must follow to manage traffic steering between UTRAN and WLAN. 

Firstly, UEs in idle mode or in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, or URA_PCH state must store and apply RAN assistance parameters received in System information block type 23, provided they are in a camped normally state. Upon cell reselection or cell selection to another cell, UEs must discard RAN assistance parameters received in UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION or CELL UPDATE CONFIRM messages and apply those received in System information block type 23.

The rules for WLANs with signaled identifiers involve conditions for steering traffic from UTRAN to WLAN and vice versa. For traffic steering from UTRAN to WLAN, the conditions include:
1. In the UTRAN serving cell:
   - Qrxlevmeas < ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, Low; or
   - Qqualmeas < ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, Low2.
2. In the target WLAN:
   - ChannelUtilizationWLAN < ThreshChUtilWLAN, Low; and
   - BackhaulRateDlWLAN > ThreshBackhRateDLWLAN, High; and
   - BackhaulRateUlWLAN > ThreshBackhRateULWLAN, High; and
   - BeaconRSSI > ThreshBeaconRSSIWLAN, High.

For traffic steering from WLAN to UTRAN, the conditions include:
1. In the source WLAN:
   - ChannelUtilizationWLAN > ThreshChUtilWLAN, High; or
   - BackhaulRateDlWLAN < ThreshBackhRateDLWLAN, Low; or
   - BackhaulRateUlWLAN < ThreshBackhRateULWLAN, Low; or
   - BeaconRSSI < ThreshBeaconRSSIWLAN, Low.
2. In the target UTRAN cell:
   - Qrxlevmeas > ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, High; and
   - Qqualmeas > ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, High2.

The UE must evaluate the UTRAN conditions on the serving cell in various states including Idle mode, URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH, and CELL_DCH. If the FDD UE is configured with DCH only, the reference cell to use is the best cell in the active set.

Specific RAN assistance parameters for traffic steering between UTRAN and WLAN include thresholds for CPICH RSCP, CPICH Ec/N0, WLAN channel utilization, backhaul bandwidth, and Beacon RSSI. These parameters are:
- ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, Low and High
- ThreshServingOffloadWLAN, Low2 and High2
- ThreshChUtilWLAN, Low and High
- ThreshBackhRateDLWLAN, Low and High
- ThreshBackhRateULWLAN, Low and High
- ThreshBeaconRSSIWLAN, Low and High

Additionally, the timer value TsteeringWLAN specifies the duration during which the rules should be fulfilled before starting traffic steering between UTRAN and WLAN.

"Describe the packet filtering requirements and the reachability restrictions for services as specified in 3GPP TS 33.117, and explain how these requirements are verified through test cases.","The packet filtering requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 33.117 include several mechanisms and functionalities that the Network Product must support. These requirements are detailed in clause 4.2.6.2.1 and include the following:

1. The Network Product must provide a mechanism to filter incoming IP packets on any IP interface at both the Network Layer and Transport Layer of the ISO/OSI stack.
2. The Network Product must support specified actions when a filter rule matches, including:
   - Discard/Drop: The matching message is discarded, no subsequent rules are applied, and no answer is sent back.
   - Accept: The matching message is accepted.
   - Account: The matching message is accounted for, i.e., a counter for the rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones and is useful for monitoring traffic before blocking it.
3. The Network Product must enable/disable logging for dropped packets for each rule, providing details on messages matching the rule for troubleshooting.
4. The Network Product must filter based on the value(s) of any portion of the protocol header.
5. The Network Product must reset the accounting.
6. The Network Product must provide a mechanism to disable/enable each defined rule.

The test case for verifying packet filtering functionality, named TC_PACKET_FILTERING, involves configuring the Network Product to allow ICMP traffic from one host while blocking it from another. The expected result is that the host allowed will receive a 'ping' answer back, while the blocked host will not.

Additionally, the reachability restrictions for services are specified in clause 4.3.2.2 of TS 33.117. The Network Product must restrict the reachability of services so that they can only be reached on interfaces where their usage is required. On interfaces where services are active, the reachability should be limited to legitimate communication peers. This limitation must be realized on the network product itself, without relying on external measures like firewalls. An example provided is that administrative services (e.g., SSH, HTTPS, RDP) should be restricted to interfaces in the management network to support the separation of management traffic from user traffic.

The test case for verifying service reachability restrictions, named TC_RESTRICTED_REACHABILITY_OF_SERVICES, involves verifying that services are bound only to the interfaces from which they are expected to be reachable. The tester uses a network port scanner to check that services are open/reachable on the configured interfaces and not on others. The expected result is that services can be enabled on a per-interface basis.

Documents TS 33.216, TS 33.326, and TS 33.511 confirm that there are no specific additions to these requirements for eNB, NSSAAF, and gNB, respectively.","The answer should cover the detailed packet filtering requirements from TS 33.117, including the mechanisms for filtering at the network and transport layers, actions on filter rule matches, logging, protocol header filtering, accounting reset, and rule enable/disable functionalities. It should also explain the test case for verifying packet filtering functionality. Additionally, the answer should describe the requirements for restricting the reachability of services to specific interfaces and legitimate communication peers, referencing the packet filtering requirements. The test case for verifying service reachability restrictions should be detailed, including pre-conditions, execution steps, and expected results. The answer should also mention that there are no specific additions to these requirements for eNB, NSSAAF, and gNB as confirmed by the respective documents."

2) The UE allows call set-up to a directory number as stored in EFFDN.
3) The UE allows call set-up to a directory number as stored in EFFDN and extended by digits at the end.
4) The UE does not allow call set-up to a directory number stored in EFFDN but with missing digits at the end.
5) The UE does not allow call set-up to a directory number having no reference in EFFDN.
6) The UE does not allow call set-up of an emergency call using the emergency numbers stored in the Terminal except '112', '911', the emergency numbers stored on the SIM/USIM, and emergency numbers downloaded from the serving network (if any).
7) The UE allows call set-up of an emergency call using the emergency number stored in the USIM.

"How are Command Packets and Response Packets structured and transmitted in SMS according to 3GPP TS 31.115, and what are the specific rules for concatenation and security?","According to 3GPP TS 31.115, the structure and transmission of Command Packets and Response Packets in SMS involve several key elements and rules:

1. **Coding of SMS Headers**: The headers for SMS-DELIVER, SMS-SUBMIT, and SMS-DELIVER-REPORT must indicate that the data is binary (8-bit data). The UDHI bit must be set to invoke the UDH functionality of the relevant SMS element. However, for Response Packets originating from the UICC, the UDHI bit will not be set due to the UICC's inability to indicate this to the ME. The Sending Entity must treat these Response Packets as if the UDHI bit was set.

2. **UDH Structure and Reserved IEI Values**: The User Data Header (UDH) structure in the Short Message element is described in TS 23.040. Information Element Identifiers (IEIs) values ranging from '70' to '7F' are reserved for specific uses, with '70' and '71' specified in the document, '72' to '7D' reserved for future use, and '7E' and '7F' for proprietary implementations.

3. **Command Packet Structure**: The Command Packet includes the Command Packet Length (CPL), Command Header Length (CHL), and the remainder of the Command Header. The CPI (Command Packet Identifier) is mapped to IEIa in the UDH structure and set to '70', while IEDa is a null field with its length set to '00'. The checksum algorithm requires input data in modulo 8 length, including CPL and CHL in the RC/CC/DS calculation.

4. **Handling Large Response Packets**: If a Response Packet is too large to fit in a single Short Message, it must be concatenated according to TS 23.040. If indicated in the SPI2 of a Command Packet to send back a PoR using SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and the Response Packet is too large, a single Response Packet must be sent back using SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, followed by a complete Response Packet using SMS-SUBMIT.

5. **Concatenation Process**: For Command Packets longer than 140 octets, they must be concatenated. The first Short Message contains the Concatenation Control Header and CPI in the UDH, while subsequent Short Messages only contain the Concatenation Control Header. The data is ciphered before being broken down into concatenated elements, but the Concatenation Control Header is not ciphered.

6. **Security Measures**: When receiving a secured Command Packet requesting a Proof of Receipt (PoR), the Receiving Entity must verify the authenticity of the Sending Entity. If authentication fails, the Command Packet is discarded without sending a Response Packet. The SPI coding rules for SMS are specified in ETSI TS 102 225.

An example of the concatenation process involves splitting a Command Packet over a sequence of three Short Messages, with the first message containing the Concatenation Control Header, CPI, and other necessary elements, while subsequent messages only contain the Concatenation Control Header.

These rules ensure the proper structure, transmission, and security of Command and Response Packets in SMS as defined in 3GPP TS 31.115.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how SMS headers are coded to indicate binary data and the setting of UDHI bit.
  - Description of the UDH structure and reserved IEI values.
  - Detailed structure of Command Packet including CPI, CPL, CHL, and their mapping in UDH.
  - Rules for handling large Response Packets and concatenation process.

"Describe the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service as defined in TS 29.594, including its architecture, operations, and interactions with other network functions.","The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service, as defined in TS 29.594, is provided by the Charging Function (CHF) and enables the NF service consumer, such as the Policy Control Function (PCF), to retrieve policy counter status information and spending limit reporting per User Equipment (UE) from the CHF. If the spending limit reporting is no longer required, the service allows the NF service consumer to unsubscribe from the reporting. 

The service applies to scenarios where the PCF interacts with the CHF in non-roaming situations, and where the Home-PCF (H-PCF) interacts with the Home-CHF (H-CHF) in home-routed scenarios. 

The architecture of the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service is depicted in two models: the Service-Based Interface (SBI) representation model and the reference point representation model. The SBI representation model illustrates how the service is provided and consumed within the network, while the reference point representation model shows the interaction points between different network functions.

The service operations defined for the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service are detailed in TS 29.594, specifically in table 4.2.1-1. These operations include various functions that facilitate the retrieval and management of spending limit information.

"Describe the process and precedence rules for de-encapsulating ISUP messages from SIP messages as outlined in TS 29.164, referencing the relevant clauses from ITU-T Q.1912.5.","The process of de-encapsulating ISUP messages from SIP messages involves the Interworking Unit (IWU) extracting the ISUP message from the SIP message body upon receipt. The IWU then maps the received SIP message to an ISUP message and merges it with the de-encapsulated ISUP message. This mapping and merging process follows specific rules outlined in ITU-T Q.1912.5, with Profile C rules detailed in Clause 6 and general rules in Clause 7.

The precedence rules for this process are as follows:
1. When a SIP header can be mapped to ISUP fields (e.g., mapping the Request-URI to the Called Party Number), the SIP header takes precedence over the encapsulated ISUP value during alignment. This is to address potential conflicts caused by service invocation within the SIP network.
2. De-encapsulated ISUP information overrides ISUP information derived from default values, rather than SIP information.
3. Local ISUP procedures may modify information derived from SIP or default values.

These rules are derived from ITU-T Q.1912.5, Clause 5.4.2, and are formulated as high-level notes rather than normative procedures. This distinction is made because the high-level notes provide sufficient guidance without the need for detailed normative procedures in real interworking scenarios.","The answer must include:
  - The IWU's responsibility in de-encapsulating ISUP messages from SIP message bodies.
  - The process of mapping and merging SIP messages with de-encapsulated ISUP messages, referencing the specific clauses from ITU-T Q.1912.5 (Clause 6 for Profile C and Clause 7 for general rules).
  - Detailed explanation of the precedence rules, including:
    - SIP header precedence over encapsulated ISUP values.
    - De-encapsulated ISUP information overriding default ISUP values.
    - Local ISUP procedures potentially modifying information derived from SIP or default values.
  - Clarification on the formulation of these rules as high-level notes rather than normative procedures."
"Describe the radio link failure procedure and RRC connection re-establishment in 3GPP TS 36.300, including specific considerations for NB-IoT UEs, RNs, DC, DAPS handover, CHO, and NTN.","The radio link failure procedure and RRC connection re-establishment in 3GPP TS 36.300 are governed by two phases. The first phase starts upon radio problem detection and leads to radio link failure detection without UE-based mobility, based on timer or other criteria (T1). The second phase starts upon radio link failure detection or handover failure, leading to RRC_IDLE with UE-based mobility, and is timer-based (T2).

For NB-IoT UEs that only use Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisations and do not support RRC Connection re-establishment for the control plane, the UE enters RRC_IDLE at the end of the first phase, bypassing the second phase. To resume activity and avoid RRC_IDLE when returning to the same or different cell, the UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED and accesses the cell through the random access procedure. The UE identifier used in the random access procedure helps the selected eNB authenticate the UE and check for a stored context. If the context is found, the connection can be resumed; otherwise, the RRC connection is released, and the UE must establish a new RRC connection via RRC_IDLE.

For RNs, upon detecting radio link failure, the RN discards any current RN subframe configuration and performs normal contention-based RACH for re-establishment. Successful re-establishment allows reconfiguration of the RN subframe.

In DC, the PCell supports both phases of the radio link failure procedure, while the PSCell supports only the first phase. Upon detecting RLF on the PSCell, the UE informs the MeNB instead of triggering re-establishment.

During DAPS handover, the UE continues detecting radio link failure at the source cell until successful random access to the target cell. If RLF is declared at the source cell, the UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED, stops data transmission/reception via the source link, and maintains the source RRC configuration. If handover fails at the target cell, the UE selects a suitable cell for RRC re-establishment or enters RRC_IDLE if no suitable cell is found.

In CHO, after RLF is declared at the source cell, the UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED and selects a suitable cell. If the selected cell is a CHO candidate and configured for CHO after RLF, the UE attempts CHO execution; otherwise, re-establishment is performed. The UE enters RRC_IDLE if no suitable cell is found.

In NTN, radio link failure and RRC connection re-establishment follow the principles described in clause 10.1.6, with additional support for mobility through target cell NTN payload assistance information in the handover command. Conditional handover is supported for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- General principles of radio link failure and RRC connection re-establishment.

"Describe the procedures and conditions under which a UE returns to its original PLMN after a disaster condition is no longer applicable, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and TS 24.501.","When a User Equipment (UE) detects that a disaster condition is no longer applicable, it performs Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) selection as described in 3GPP TS 23.122 and TS 24.501. The UE may return to the PLMN that previously had the disaster condition. The PLMN providing disaster roaming service has several methods to trigger the return of Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs to their original PLMN:

1. **PLMN Selection**: The UE performs PLMN selection to return to the original PLMN.
2. **Deregistration Procedure**: The PLMN may trigger the deregistration procedure to prompt the UE to return.
3. **Rejection of Registration/Service Requests**: The PLMN may reject the UE's registration or service request messages to encourage the return.
4. **Ensuring No Overload**: The PLMN must organize the return of UEs in a manner that prevents overload, such as signaling overload, in the original PLMN.
5. **Broadcasting Cessation**: The PLMN stops broadcasting the disaster roaming service once the disaster condition ends.
6. **UE Configuration Update**: If the disaster condition has ended and the UE has an emergency PDU session, the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) initiates the UE configuration update procedure to indicate that the UE is registered for emergency services.
7. **Re-registration Requirement**: If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED mode, the PLMN may inform the UE that re-registration is required by initiating the UE configuration update procedure.

The NG-RAN in the PLMN providing disaster roaming service broadcasts an indication of accessibility for disaster roaming service and optionally a list of PLMNs with disaster conditions. The UE determines the disaster condition based on this broadcast information and performs network selection and access control for disaster roaming.

The procedures ensure that the transition back to the original PLMN is managed efficiently and without causing network overload, maintaining service continuity and reliability.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The process for UE to detect the end of a disaster condition and perform PLMN selection.

1. **SIP INVITE Request Process**:
   - To transfer all media streams of an existing session from another UE to the SC UE, the SC UE sends a SIP INVITE request. This request must be populated with specific header fields:

"Compare and contrast the specifications for GERAN_CI, UTRAN_CI, and EUTRA_CI as defined in 3GPP TS 24.312. Additionally, explain the role of the AccessNetworkArea node in the context of network location descriptions.","The GERAN_CI, UTRAN_CI, and EUTRA_CI leaves in 3GPP TS 24.312 serve to indicate cell identities for different types of network-related location descriptions. 

The GERAN_CI leaf specifies a cell identity for a GERAN network. It occurs zero or one time, is formatted as a binary string, and has a fixed length of 16 bits. The value is obtained from the lower layers of the UE and is part of the Cell Global Identity as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003.

The UTRAN_CI leaf indicates a cell identity for a UTRAN network. Similar to GERAN_CI, it occurs zero or one time and is formatted as a binary string. However, it has a fixed length of 28 bits. The value is defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 and is also obtained from the lower layers of the UE.

The EUTRA_CI leaf represents a cell identity for an E-UTRA network. It occurs zero or one time, is formatted as a binary string, and has a fixed length of 28 bits. The value is part of the Evolved Cell Global Identifier as described in 3GPP TS 36.331 and is obtained from the lower layers of the UE.

The AccessNetworkArea node acts as a placeholder for describing the location where a particular access network is expected to be available. It occurs once and is formatted as a node. If the UE is aware that it is located in one of the described locations under this node, it may assume the corresponding access network to be available. If the node is present but empty, it is not considered when evaluating discovery information.

"What is the significance of the 'Last-Modified' header in HTTP responses, and how does it relate to conditional requests with the 'If-Modified-Since' header?","The 'Last-Modified' header in HTTP responses is crucial for managing cacheable resources. It indicates the date and time at which the resource was last modified. This header is particularly important for enabling conditional requests. When an NF Service Consumer makes a request with the 'If-Modified-Since' header, it is asking the server to only send the resource if it has been modified since the specified date and time. If the resource has not been modified, the server can respond with a status code indicating that the resource has not changed, thus saving bandwidth and reducing unnecessary data transfer. This mechanism is described in IETF RFC 7232 clause 2.2, which outlines how these headers should be used to optimize HTTP responses and improve efficiency in data handling.","The answer should explain the purpose of the 'Last-Modified' header in HTTP responses, specifically in the context of cacheable resources like SmfSelectionSubscriptionData.

Describe the mechanisms and procedures for maintaining and releasing dedicated RR connections in CTS systems as specified in TS 43.052.,"The mechanisms and procedures for maintaining and releasing dedicated RR connections in CTS systems as specified in TS 43.052 involve several key components:

1. **Radio Link Failure Detection**: The CTS-FP (Cordless Telephony System - Fixed Part) and CTS-MS (Cordless Telephony System - Mobile Station) are responsible for detecting radio link failures. If the quality of the dedicated RR (Radio Resource) connection is unacceptable and cannot be improved through RF power control or intracell handover, the connection must be released. A radio link failure message is then sent to the upper layers (Document 1).

2. **RF Power Control**: In the RR Active state, RF power control is used to minimize the transmit power required by the CTS-MS or CTS-FP while maintaining the quality of the radio link. Both the CTS-MS and CTS-FP apply power control in the uplink and downlink. The CTS-FP determines the output power control level for the CTS-MS and communicates it via the SACCH (Slow Associated Control Channel). The requirements for the power control algorithm are specified in GSM 05.08 (Document 2).

3. **Intracell Handover**: When the connection quality is unacceptable in the RR Active state, an intracell handover (change of active timeslot) is carried out. This handover is triggered by the CTS-FP, which reassigns another randomly chosen timeslot for the dedicated connection (Document 3).

4. **Releasing Dedicated RR Connections**: Dedicated RR connections are released under two main conditions: when triggered by the upper layers or when a radio link failure is detected. In both cases, the CTS-MS and CTS-FP are responsible for releasing the connection (Document 4).

These procedures ensure that the quality of the radio link is maintained and that connections with unacceptable quality are promptly released to maintain overall system performance.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of radio link failure detection in ensuring the release of dedicated RR connections with unacceptable quality.
- The implementation of RF power control in the RR Active state to maintain radio link quality, including the determination and communication of power control levels.

"Describe the Announcing Alert procedure for restricted ProSe direct discovery model A, including the conditions for initiation and the key elements involved in the procedure.","The Announcing Alert procedure for restricted ProSe direct discovery model A is designed to enable the ProSe Function in the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) to send the ProSe Restricted Code to the announcing User Equipment (UE). This code is generated during the announce request procedure for restricted ProSe direct discovery model A. The procedure is initiated when the ProSe Function determines that the announcing UE and the monitoring UE are close enough to trigger the Announcing Alert.

Before initiating the Announcing Alert procedure, the ProSe Function must ensure proximity between the announcing UE and the monitoring UE. Once this condition is met, the announcing UE includes the ProSe Restricted Code in a PC5_DISCOVERY message, which is then transmitted over the PC5 interface in the registered PLMN or local PLMN.

The procedure is further detailed with specific conditions for initiation:
1. If the UE has previously initiated an announce request procedure for restricted ProSe direct discovery model A and the On Demand Announcing Enabled Indicator associated with the RPAUID in the announcing UE context is set to 1, the ProSe Function will initiate the Announcing Alert procedure under the following conditions:
   a) When the ProSe Function receives a pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID from the ProSe Application Server, and the Target RPAUID matches the RPAUID stored in the announcing UE context, indicating that the monitoring UE is in the vicinity of the announcing UE.
   b) When the ProSe Function receives a pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID from other ProSe Functions, and the Target RPAUID matches the RPAUID stored in the announcing UE context, indicating that the monitoring UE is in the vicinity of the announcing UE.

The ProSe Function initiates the Announcing Alert procedure by sending an ANNOUNCING_ALERT_REQUEST message, which includes:
- A new ProSe Function transaction ID.
- The UE identity set to the UE's IMSI.
- The RPAUID set to the Target RPAUID received from the ProSe Application Server or other ProSe Functions.
- The ProSe Restricted Code or the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix, and optionally one or more ProSe Restricted Code Suffix Ranges.
- The Discovery Entry ID associated with the corresponding discovery entry in the UE's context.

"Describe the transmitter and receiver exclusion bands for BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O, including the relevant frequency ranges and conditions under which these bands apply.","The transmitter exclusion band for BS type 1-O is the frequency range over which no tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. It is defined as FDL,low – ΔfOBUE < f < FDL,high + ΔfOBUE, where the values of FDL,low and FDL,high are specified for each operating band in TS 38.104, clause 5.2, and the value of ΔfOBUE is derived considering the width of the operating band, as defined in TS 38.104, clause 6.6.2. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the total transmitter exclusion band is a combination of the exclusion bands for each operating band supported by the BS. Notably, the transmitter exclusion bands do not apply to SUL bands, and there is no transmitter exclusion band defined for BS type 2-O due to the radiated immunity testing being defined in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 6 GHz.

The receiver exclusion band for BS is the frequency range over which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made. For BS type 1-O, it is defined as FUL,low – ΔfOOB < f < FUL,high + ΔfOOB, where the values of FUL,low and FUL,high are specified for each operating band in TS 38.104, clause 5.2, and the value of ΔfOOB is derived considering the width of the operating band, as defined in TS 38.104, clause 7.4.2.2. If the spatial exclusion zone is not used during EMC RI testing, the receiver exclusion band for BS type 1-O is defined as FUL,low – ΔfRIexclusion < f < FUL,high + ΔfRIexclusion, with the values of ΔfRIexclusion provided in table 4.4.2-1. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the total receiver exclusion band is a combination of the exclusion bands for each operating band supported by the BS. The receiver exclusion bands do not apply to SDL bands, and there is no receiver exclusion band defined for BS type 2-O due to the radiated immunity testing being defined in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 6 GHz.","The answer should include the definitions of transmitter and receiver exclusion bands for BS type 1-O, specifying the frequency ranges and the values of FDL,low, FDL,high, ΔfOBUE, FUL,low, FUL,high, and ΔfOOB. It should also mention the conditions under which these bands apply, including the multi-band operation and the exclusion bands not applying to SUL and SDL bands. Additionally, it should clarify that there are no exclusion bands defined for BS type 2-O due to the radiated immunity testing frequency range."
"Compare the different Radio Block structures for control message transfer as specified in TS 43.064, focusing on their formats, encoding methods, and applicable scenarios.","The Radio Block structures for control message transfer as specified in TS 43.064 vary in their formats, encoding methods, and applicable scenarios. 

1. **General Format (Document 1)**:
   - **Encoding Method**: CS-1 encoding.
   - **Components**: This format consists of one MAC header, one RLC/MAC Control Block, and one Block Check Sequence (BCS). The MAC header has a constant length of 8 bits.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This format is applicable to any control message except for downlink PDCH pairs supporting TBFs in RTTI configuration using the BTTI USF mode, uplink PDCHs or PDCH pairs in RTTI configuration where an alternative format may be used by a MS in DLMC configuration, and control messages on the EC-PACCH. It may optionally be used on downlink PDCH pairs supporting TBFs in RTTI configuration using the RTTI USF mode.
   - **Error Detection**: The BCS is used for error detection.

2. **Downlink Format for RTTI Configuration (Document 2)**:
   - **Encoding Method**: MCS-0 encoding.
   - **Components**: This format includes one RLC/MAC header, one Header Check Sequence (HCS), one RLC/MAC Control Block, and one Block Check Sequence (BCS). The RLC/MAC header together with the BCS has a constant length of 31 bits.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: This format is used on downlink PDCH pairs supporting TBFs in RTTI configuration using the BTTI USF mode and may optionally be used on downlink PDCH pairs supporting TBFs in RTTI configuration using the RTTI USF mode.
   - **Error Detection**: The HCS is used for error detection of the header part, and the BCS is used for error detection of the RLC/MAC control message.

3. **Alternative Uplink Format (Document 3)**:
   - **Encoding Method**: CS-3 encoding.
   - **Components**: This format consists of one MAC header, one RLC/MAC Control Block, and one Block Check Sequence (BCS). The MAC header has a constant length of 8 bits.

"Describe the test case for verifying inter-RAT SS-RSRQ measurement accuracy as specified in TS 38.533, including the test purpose, applicability, initial conditions, procedure, and requirements.","The test case for verifying inter-RAT SS-RSRQ measurement accuracy as specified in TS 38.533 involves several key components:

1. **Test Purpose**: The purpose of this test is to verify that the inter-RAT SS-RSRQ measurement accuracy is within the specified limits for all bands when the serving cell is E-UTRA and the target cell is NR FR2.

2. **Test Applicability**: This test applies to all E-UTRA UE release 15 onwards that are capable of NR FR2 measurements.

3. **Initial Conditions**: The test shall be conducted using any of the test configurations specified in the relevant tables. The general test parameter settings, message contents, and carrier/cell specifications must be set up according to the provided guidelines. Specifically, E-UTRA Cell 1 is configured as the E-UTRA PCell on the E-UTRA carrier, and Cell 2 is the NR neighbour cell on the NR carrier. The UE Rx beam peak direction must be obtained using one of the Rx beam peak search procedures.

4. **Test Procedure**: 
   - Ensure the UE is in State 3A-RF.
   - Set the parameters according to the specified tables.
   - Transmit an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1 to configure inter-RAT NR neighbour cell periodical measurements.
   - The UE shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
   - The UE shall periodically transmit MeasurementReport messages.
   - After a 10-second wait from the initial configuration step, check the SS-RSRQ reported values in the periodic MeasurementReport. Compare the SS-RSRQ value of Cell 2 reported by the UE to the expected SS-RSRQ. If the value is outside the specified limits or the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 2, increase the number of failed iterations. Otherwise, increase the number of passed iterations.

What are the requirements for Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for IAB-MT types 1-H and 1-O?,"The requirements for Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for IAB-MT types 1-H and 1-O are specified in 3GPP TS 38.174. For IAB-MT type 1-H, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes outlined in table 6.5.2.2.2-1 must be met using the frame structure described in clause 6.5.2.2.3. When the transmission timing mode is set to 'Case6', the power imbalance for simultaneous transmission between IAB-DU and IAB-MT under which the system can be operated is declared by the manufacturer. EVM evaluation for IAB-MT type 1-H should be performed for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and uplink subframes within 10 ms measurement periods, and the boundaries of these periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

For IAB-MT type 1-O, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes outlined in table 6.5.2.2.2-1 must also be met, with the requirements being the same as those specified in clause 6.5.2.2.2.","The answer should include the specific EVM requirements for IAB-MT type 1-H and type 1-O, referencing the modulation schemes in table 6.5.2.2.2-1.

Additionally, it should mention the transmission timing mode 'Case6' and the manufacturer's declaration of power imbalance for type 1-H. For type 1-O, it should confirm that the requirements are the same as those in clause 6.5.2.2.2."
"Describe the error-handling procedures for unknown and erroneous protocol data as specified in TS 44.060, including the role of Extension Bits and examples of handling erroneous data.","The error-handling procedures for unknown and erroneous protocol data as specified in TS 44.060 are mandatory for mobile stations. These procedures are designed to manage syntactically incorrect messages, which are defined as messages that violate the rules of clauses 11 and 12 or contain values marked as 'reserved' in these clauses. However, if a specific interpretation for a 'reserved' value is defined in clause 11 or 12, that interpretation takes precedence, and the field remains syntactically correct.

Decoding a received message based on its CSN.1 description results in either complete acceptance or rejection of the message. Error handling allows for partial acceptance of a message even if some parts are erroneous. Error detection mechanisms are introduced to identify which parts of a message need protection against specific types of errors.

The Extension Bits information element, as described in TS 44.060 clause 12.26, provides a generalized means for possible future extensions within a message. This information element is of variable length and includes a length indicator and spare bits.

Examples of handling erroneous protocol data are provided in Annex G of TS 44.060. These examples illustrate the procedures defined in sub-clause 11.1, including the use of error labels for treating syntactical errors in received messages.","The answer should cover the mandatory procedures for handling unknown and erroneous protocol data by mobile stations, including the criteria for syntactically incorrect messages and the handling of reserved values.

1. **UE in RRC_Connected State with Multicast MRB Established**:
   - The UE is in the RRC_Connected state with a Multicast MRB established, which includes a DL-only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission and an RLC-AM entity for PTP transmission.
   - The PDCP is configured with an 18-bit sequence number (SN).

2. **PDCP Configurations**:
   - The initialRX-DELIV-r17 parameter in the PDCP-Config for the Multicast MRB is not zero.

3. **UE Behavior When Receiving PDCP Data PDU**:
   - If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT < initialRX-DELIV, it discards the PDCP Data PDU.
   - If the UE receives a PDCP Data PDU with RCVD_COUNT = initialRX-DELIV, it delivers the PDCP Data PDU to the upper layers.

4. **Lossless Handover with PDCP Data Recovery**:
   - When the UE is requested to make a lossless handover with PDCP data recovery, it creates a PDCP status report to the source side (SS).
   - If the UE receives a retransmitted PDCP Data PDU in the RLC-AM entity for PTP transmission, which failed in the RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission before the handover, it delivers the PDCP Data PDU to the upper layers.

5. **Lossless Handover with PDCP Re-establishment**:

"Describe the associated delivery procedures for MBMS, including the requirements for file repair, reception reporting, and consumption reporting, and the security measures for these procedures.","The associated delivery procedures for MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) are designed to provide auxiliary features to MBMS user services before, during, or after the MBMS data transmission phase. These procedures include file repair, reception reporting, and consumption reporting, and are essential for ensuring the integrity and quality of MBMS services.

1. **File Repair**: This procedure is used for post-delivery repair of files that were initially delivered as part of an MBMS download session. MBMS Download receivers must support the file repair procedure, which involves using standard HTTP/1.1 servers to facilitate byte-range-based file repair. The network can selectively enable or disable confidentiality protection for file repair based on server identities using the HTTPS or HTTP scheme.

2. **Reception Reporting**: This procedure involves reporting the reception of download files and/or media streams of an MBMS User Service delivered to an MBMS UE (User Equipment). It may include reporting DASH QoE metrics for a DASH-over-MBMS service. MBMS Download and Streaming receivers must support reception reporting procedures, which are specified in detail in the relevant sub-clauses. Confidentiality protection for reception reporting can be enabled or disabled based on server identities using the HTTPS or HTTP scheme.

3. **Consumption Reporting**: This procedure involves reporting the consumption of MBMS User Services. MBMS Download receivers must support consumption reporting procedures, which are specified in detail in the relevant sub-clauses. Similar to file repair and reception reporting, confidentiality protection for consumption reporting can be enabled or disabled based on server identities using the HTTPS or HTTP scheme.

To enable these procedures, a point-to-point connection is established, and MBMS session parameters received during User Service Discovery/Announcement are used to communicate the context to the network and the MBMS sender infrastructure. To avoid network congestion and protect servers against overload situations, the associated delivery procedures from different MBMS UEs are distributed over time and resources.

**Security Measures**: The security measures for these procedures include the use of HTTPS for confidentiality protection. The UE (User Equipment) must authenticate the HTTP server using a server certificate and match the server name as specified in RFC 2818. The UE must use a preconfigured list of trusted root certificates for TLS server certificate validation, and it is recommended to use a separate preconfigured list for associated delivery procedures. Server certificate validation must not require manual user interaction.

In summary, the associated delivery procedures for MBMS ensure the integrity and quality of MBMS services through file repair, reception reporting, and consumption reporting, while implementing security measures such as HTTPS and trusted root certificates to protect these procedures.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- Overview of associated delivery procedures and their purpose.

"How does the UE handle originating and network-initiated USSD requests over IMS according to 3GPP TS 24.390, and what are the specific considerations for different IP-Connectivity Access Networks?","According to 3GPP TS 24.390, the User Equipment (UE) handles originating and network-initiated USSD requests over IMS based on several conditions and procedures. 

For originating USSD requests, if the domain selection for originating voice calls determines that the UE uses IMS, and the UE is not configured with a Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) operator preference for using the Circuit Switched (CS) domain for USSD requests, or if the UE does not support the CS domain, then the UE can invoke the procedures specified in subclause 4.5.4. Otherwise, the UE shall not invoke these procedures.

For network-initiated USSD requests, if the UE supports USSD over IMS, it must include the g.3gpp.nw-init-ussi media feature tag in the Contact header field when registering to the IP Multimedia Core Network (IM CN) subsystem. This tag is specified in Annex B.2 of the document.

Specific considerations for different IP-Connectivity Access Networks are detailed in the annexes of TS 24.390:
- Annex C covers concepts for using GPRS to access the IM CN subsystem.
- Annex D covers concepts for using EPS to access the IM CN subsystem.
- Annex E covers concepts for using 5GS to access the IM CN subsystem.

These annexes provide normative guidelines on how the UE should handle connectivity and access procedures specific to each type of network, ensuring seamless integration and operation within the IMS framework.","The answer should include the conditions under which the UE uses IMS for originating voice calls and USSD requests, the requirement for the g.3gpp.nw-init-ussi media feature tag, and the procedures for both originating and network-initiated USSD requests over IMS.

"Describe the procedure for the removal of an access network from a multi-access PDN connection, including scenarios where reactivation is requested.","The removal of an access network from a multi-access PDN connection can be initiated either by the User Equipment (UE) or the network. There are two possible scenarios for this procedure: either the multi-access PDN connection via the 3GPP access network is removed while the connection via the WLAN access network is maintained, or vice versa. Once the procedure is completed, the UE uses the PDN connection over the maintained access network, except in cases where a network-initiated PDN connection release with the cause 'reactivation requested' occurs.

When the UE receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message with the cause 'reactivation requested' over a trusted WLAN, and the PDN connection is established on both accesses while the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode over the 3GPP access, the UE must follow the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 to locally release the PDN connection over the 3GPP access and re-establish the PDN connection over at least one access, with the choice of access being implementation-specific. If the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, it follows the connection release procedure initiated by the network.

Upon receipt of a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the EPS bearer context of a default EPS bearer context and ESM cause #39 'reactivation requested' over the 3GPP access, if the corresponding PDN connection is established over both 3GPP access and WLAN, the UE must complete the EPS bearer context deactivation as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 and locally release the corresponding PDN connection over trusted WLAN and untrusted WLAN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.244 and 3GPP TS 24.302, respectively. The UE should then re-establish the PDN connection(s) over at least one access, with the choice of access being implementation-specific.

Similarly, upon receipt of a DETACH REQUEST message with the detach type 're-attach required' over 3GPP access, if the PDN connection(s) is established over both 3GPP access and WLAN, the UE must locally release the corresponding PDN connection over trusted WLAN and untrusted WLAN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.244 and 3GPP TS 24.302, respectively, and re-attach through E-UTRAN access using procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.301. The UE should then re-establish any previously established PDN connection(s) in the 3GPP access.

Finally, upon receipt of an INFORMATIONAL request message including the DELETE payload and a NOTIFY payload with a private status type indicating a 'reactivation requested' cause, if the PDN connection is established on both accesses and the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode over the 3GPP access, the UE must follow the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 to locally release the PDN connection over the 3GPP access and re-establish the PDN connection over at least one access, with the choice of access being implementation-specific. If the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, it follows the connection release procedure initiated by the network.","The answer must include the initiation process for the removal of an access network from a multi-access PDN connection, detailing the scenarios where either 3GPP or WLAN access is maintained.

"Describe the key functionalities and configurations of the CGF (Charging Gateway Function) in managing and routing CDR (Call Detail Records) files, including file closure conditions and transfer mechanisms.","The Charging Gateway Function (CGF) plays a crucial role in managing and routing Call Detail Records (CDRs). In its default mode of operation, the CGF manages a single file for storing all acceptable CDRs. However, it can also route CDRs to different files based on configured routing filters. These filters can be set up using OAM&P commands and can include criteria such as CDR type and the originating CDF. The CGF ensures that each file contains only the CDRs matching its associated routing filter, while the default file stores all CDRs that do not match any configured filters.

The CGF supports various criteria for routing CDRs, including:
- CDRs of a single type
- CDRs of specified types (e.g., only IMS CDR types)
- CDRs originated by a single CDF
- CDRs originated by a set of CDFs
- Any combination of the above

The implementation specifics, such as the maximum number of simultaneously open CDR files, the order of filter evaluation, and the configuration of filters by OAM&P, are left to the discretion of the implementation. Operators should ensure that the routing filters assigned to each file do not overlap to avoid arbitrary routing of CDRs.

Several conditions govern the closure of a CDR file by the CGF, including:
- Configurable file size limit
- Configurable file closure time
- Configurable file lifetime (interval)
- Configurable number of CDRs within the file
- CDR release, version, or encoding change
- Manual OAM&P actions
- System-defined reasons (e.g., file system full)

When a CDR file is closed, the next matching CDR is placed in the next file in the chain. The timing of file generation is implementation-specific and can occur immediately after the previous file is closed, when the next matching CDR arrives, or anytime in between. Each CDR file contains all acceptable matching CDRs received and processed by the CGF between the closure of the previous file and the configured file closure trigger of the current file. Upon file closure, the CDR file is immediately available for transfer to the BD.

CDR files can be removed from the CGF through various methods:
- By the BD issuing commands provided by the file transfer protocol
- By the CGF application once the file has been transferred
- Due to CGF file system storage limitations or configurable file age limits
- OAM&P action

To avoid loss of CDRs, operators should manage the system to prevent system-defined file closure triggers.

In the push transfer mode, the CGF writes CDR files to the BD filestore at a time and frequency controlled by the CGF, operating in client mode while the BD operates in server mode. The CGF can send different files to different BD systems based on the CDR routing function. Events that can trigger a file push include:
- Availability of new CDR files for transmission
- Exceeding a configurable total size limit
- Elapsed configurable regular time interval
- Exceeding CGF filestore utilization level

If the file transfer fails, the CGF logs the error and generates appropriate alarms. Measures to handle file transfer failures are discussed in the document, but security measures, such as mutual identification and verification of peer systems, are outside the scope of the document.","The answer must include details on how the CGF manages CDR files, the criteria and filters used for routing CDRs, the conditions under which CDR files are closed, the timing of file generation, the mechanisms for transferring files to the BD, and the events that trigger file transfers.

Describe the procedures and verifications involved in the controlling MCData function when handling MSRP SEND requests in both one-to-one and group standalone SDS using media plane.,"The controlling MCData function plays a crucial role in anchoring the media between the originating MCData client and the terminating MCData client, maintaining an MSRP session with all active MCData clients. The procedures for handling MSRP SEND requests are applicable for both one-to-one and group standalone SDS using media plane.

Upon receiving an MSRP SEND request from the originating participating MCData function, the controlling MCData function must follow these steps:

1. For a standalone one-to-one SDS using media plane, it verifies that the SDS message size is less than or equal to the <max-data-size-sds-bytes> element in the MCData service configuration document.
2. For a standalone group SDS using media plane, it verifies:
   a. The SDS message size is less than or equal to the <mcdata-max-data-in-single-request> element of the MCData group document.
   b. The SDS message size is less than or equal to the <mcdata-on-network-max-data-size-for-SDS> element of the MCData group document.

If any of these verifications fail, the controlling MCData function sends an MSRP response with the error code 403 to the MCData client that sent the SDS message and does not continue with the rest of the procedure.

If the verifications are successful, the controlling MCData function generates and sends an MSRP 200 (OK) response for the received MSRP SEND requests to the originating participating MCData function, following the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975. It then forwards the received MSRP SEND requests to each terminating MCData client with which a successful MSRP connection was established, modifying the To-Path and From-Path headers according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The role of the controlling MCData function in anchoring media and maintaining MSRP sessions.

"Describe the procedure for testing UE handover performance between two cells as specified in TS 36.521 5.3.3.4.2, including the key steps and conditions involved.","The procedure for testing UE handover performance between two cells as specified in TS 36.521 5.3.3.4.2 involves several key steps and conditions. The test setup includes one active cell (Cell 1) and one neighbor cell (Cell 2). The test is divided into two successive time periods, T1 and T2.

During T1, the UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. A RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE during this period. The start of T2 is marked by the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. At this point, Cell 2 becomes detectable, and the UE receives a RRC handover command from the network.

The detailed steps are as follows:
1. Ensure the UE is in State 3B-RF according to TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.4, with Cell 1 as the active cell.
2. Set the parameters according to T1 in Tables 5.3.3.5-1 and 5.3.3.5-2, and propagation conditions as per Annex B clause B.1.1. Start T1.
3. The SS transmits the message containing Information Element systemTimeInfo as defined in TS 36.331 clause 6.3.1. The neighbor cell broadcasts its own PN offset, and the SS transmits an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
4. The UE transmits an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The SS transmits a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message implying handover to Cell 2.
6. At the start of T2, the SS switches the power settings from T1 to T2 as specified in Tables 5.3.3.5-1 and 5.3.3.5-2.
7. If the UE starts to transmit the Reverse Control Channel to Cell 2 within 127 ms from the beginning of T2, the test is considered successful. Otherwise, it is considered a failure.
8. After T2 expires, the UE is switched off and then ensured to be in State 3A-RF according to TS 36.508 clause 7.2A.3, with Cell 1 as the active cell.
9. The SS sets a different PN Offset on Cell 2 to invalidate the previous timing information of Cell 2 in the UE for the next iteration of the test procedure loop.
10. Repeat steps 2-9 until the confidence level specified in Tables G.2.3-1 in Annex G clause G.2 is achieved.

Additional test conditions and parameters for UE performance testing are provided in TS 36.521 7.2. The Information Element systemTimeInfo plays a crucial role in the RRC messages, as defined in TS 36.331 clause 6.3.1.","The answer must include:
    - Description of the test setup with one active cell and one neighbor cell.
    - Explanation of the time durations T1 and T2 and their significance.
    - Detailed steps for sending and receiving RRC messages during the test.
    - Conditions for detecting Cell 2 and initiating handover.
    - Criteria for determining successful handover within 127 ms.
    - Iteration process for achieving the required confidence level.
    - Reference to additional test conditions and parameters from TS 36.521 7.2.

Describe the initial configuration procedures for different clients interacting with the Data Collection AF as specified in TS 26.532.,"The initial configuration procedures for different clients interacting with the Data Collection AF as specified in TS 26.532 involve several steps and interactions. 

1. **Indirect Data Collection Client**:
   - The Indirect Data Collection Client initiates the configuration by invoking the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation, sending an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF. The request includes a DataReportingSession resource entity with properties externalApplicationId and supportedDomains.
   - The Data Collection AF responds with a 201 Created status, providing an expanded DataReportingSession resource entity that includes additional properties such as sessionId, validUntil, reportForDomains, and reportingCondition. The validUntil property should be set to a future time.
   - The Indirect Data Collection Client is now configured.

2. **Application Server**:
   - Similar to the Indirect Data Collection Client, the Application Server invokes the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF. The request includes a DataReportingSession resource entity with properties externalApplicationId and supportedDomains.
   - The Data Collection AF responds with a 201 Created status, providing an expanded DataReportingSession resource entity that includes additional properties such as sessionId, validUntil, reportForDomains, and reportingCondition. The validUntil property should be set to a future time.
   - The Application Server is now configured.

3. **Direct Data Collection Client**:
   - The Direct Data Collection Client initiates the configuration by invoking the Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession service operation, sending an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF. The request includes a DataReportingSession resource entity with properties externalApplicationId and supportedDomains.
   - The Data Collection AF responds with a 201 Created status, providing an extended version of the DataReportingSession resource entity that includes additional properties such as sessionId, validUntil, reportForDomains, and reportingCondition. The validUntil property should be set to a future time.
   - The Direct Data Collection Client is now configured.

4. **UE Application**:
   - Upon activation, the UE Application requests its data collection and reporting configuration from the Direct Data Collection Client by invoking the registerUeApplication method at reference point R7. The UE Application provides its External Application Identifier, Application Service Provider identifier, and callback listener information. It also indicates its consent for the UE identity (GPSI) to be included in Data Reports.
   - The Direct Data Collection Client establishes a new Data Reporting Session with the Data Collection AF using the procedure specified for the Direct Data Collection Client. If consent is given, the GPSI is included; otherwise, an opaque client reporting identifier is generated and included.
   - The Direct Data Collection Client returns a UE data collection and reporting configuration to the UE Application based on the information from the newly created Data Reporting Session resource.

5. **Resetting the Opaque Client Reporting Identifier**:
   - The UE Application can reset the opaque client reporting identifier at any time by invoking the resetClientReportingIdentifier method at reference point R7.
   - The Direct Data Collection Client destroys the current Data Reporting Session and generates a new opaque client reporting identifier. It then creates a replacement Data Reporting Session using the specified procedure.

These procedures ensure that the various clients are properly configured to interact with the Data Collection AF, facilitating efficient data collection and reporting.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The steps involved in the initial configuration of Indirect Data Collection Client, Application Server, and Direct Data Collection Client.
  - The properties included in the DataReportingSession resource entity during the request and response phases.
  - The specific procedures for UE Application to request data collection and reporting configuration, including the handling of GPSI and opaque client reporting identifier.
  - The process for resetting the opaque client reporting identifier and the subsequent creation of a new Data Reporting Session."
"Describe the process and requirements for TMGI allocation and renewal in a 3GPP network, including error handling and expiration notifications.","The process for TMGI allocation and renewal in a 3GPP network involves several steps and components, including the SCS/AS, SCEF, and BM-SC. 

1. **TMGI Allocation Request**:
   - The SCS/AS initiates the TMGI allocation process by sending an HTTP POST request to the SCEF to the resource 'TMGI Allocation'. The request body must include the External Group Identifier and may include location information.
   - Upon receiving the request, the SCEF checks if the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI allocation. If authorized, the SCEF initiates the TMGI allocation by the BM-SC as defined in the relevant 3GPP specifications.
   - If the allocation is successful, the SCEF creates a resource representing the TMGI allocation, addressed by a URI containing the SCS identity and TMGI, and responds to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message including the TMGI and its expiration time.

2. **TMGI Expiration Time Renewal**:
   - To renew the TMGI expiration time, the SCS/AS sends an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the SCEF to the resource 'Individual TMGI Allocation'.
   - The SCEF then initiates the renewal process with the BM-SC. If successful, the SCEF updates the resource and responds to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK message including the new expiration time or a 204 No Content message if the renewal is successful without content in the response body.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the BM-SC returns an error code for the allocation or renewal request, the SCEF does not create or update the resource and responds to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code.
   - The HTTP client must support processing of status codes and handling of the 'ProblemDetails' JSON object with the Content-Type header set to 'application/problem+json' for all applicable methods.

4. **BM-SC's Role in TMGI Allocation**:
   - The BM-SC handles TMGI allocation requests by verifying the authorization of the GCS AS and determining the expiration time for new and renewed TMGIs.
   - The BM-SC responds with a GCS-Action-Answer (GAA) command including the TMGI-Allocation-Response AVP. For successful allocations, this includes TMGI AVPs and the MBMS-Session-Duration AVP indicating the new expiration time. For partial successes, it includes both successful TMGIs and reasons for any failures.

5. **TMGI Expiration Notification**:
   - Upon TMGI expiration, the BM-SC notifies the GCS AS by sending a GCS-Notification-Request (GNR) command including the TMGI-Expiry AVP.
   - If there are active MBMS bearers related to the expiring TMGI, the BM-SC terminates these bearers and notifies the GCS AS about the termination through MBMS-Bearer-Event-Notification AVPs in the GNR.

This comprehensive process ensures proper allocation, renewal, error handling, and expiration notification for TMGIs in a 3GPP network.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The initial request process for TMGI allocation by the SCS/AS, including the required HTTP POST message and authorization checks by the SCEF.
  - The renewal process for TMGI expiration time, including the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods and the SCEF's role in initiating renewal.
  - Error handling mechanisms, including the use of 'ProblemDetails' JSON object and specific error codes.
  - The BM-SC's role in determining authorization and handling TMGI allocation requests, including the structure of successful and partial success responses.
  - The notification process for TMGI expiration, including the termination of active MBMS bearers and the GCS-Notification-Request command."
Explain the process and key elements involved in the activation and deactivation of TCI states for UE-specific PDSCH as specified in 3GPP TS 38.321.,"The process of activating and deactivating TCI (Transmission Configuration Indication) states for UE-specific PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) involves several key elements and steps as specified in 3GPP TS 38.321.

Firstly, the network has the capability to activate and deactivate the configured TCI states for PDSCH of a Serving Cell or a set of Serving Cells. This is done by sending the TCI States Activation/Deactivation for UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE (Medium Access Control Control Element) or the Enhanced TCI States Activation/Deactivation for UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE. Initially, the configured TCI states for PDSCH are deactivated upon (re-)configuration by upper layers and after reconfiguration with synchronization.

The TCI States Activation/Deactivation for UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID (Logical Channel ID). It includes several fields:
- Serving Cell ID: Indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies, with a length of 5 bits.
- BWP ID: Indicates a DL BWP (Downlink Bandwidth Part) for which the MAC CE applies, with a length of 2 bits.
- Ti: Indicates the activation/deactivation status of the TCI state with TCI-StateId i. The Ti field is set to 1 to activate the TCI state and mapped to the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field, and set to 0 to deactivate it.
- CORESET Pool ID: Indicates the mapping between the activated TCI states and the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication set by field Ti, specific to the ControlResourceSetId configured with CORESET Pool ID.

The Enhanced TCI States Activation/Deactivation for UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE is identified by a MAC PDU subheader with eLCID (enhanced Logical Channel ID). It includes several fields:
- Serving Cell ID: Indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies, with a length of 5 bits.
- BWP ID: Indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies, with a length of 2 bits.
- Ci: Indicates whether the octet containing TCI state IDi,2 is present.
- TCI state IDi,j: Indicates the TCI state identified by TCI-StateId, where i is the index of the codepoint of the DCI Transmission configuration indication field and TCI state IDi,j denotes the jth TCI state indicated for the ith codepoint.
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0.

The mapping process of TCI states to codepoints is determined by their ordinal position among all the TCI states with Ti field set to 1. The maximum number of activated TCI states is 8, and the activated TCI states can be associated with at most one PCI (Physical Cell Identity) different from the Serving Cell PCI at a time. For the Enhanced TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE, the maximum number of activated TCI codepoints is 8, and the maximum number of TCI states mapped to a TCI codepoint is 2.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The network's role in activating and deactivating TCI states for PDSCH.
- The initial deactivation status of TCI states upon (re-)configuration.
- The structure and fields of the TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE, including Serving Cell ID, BWP ID, Ti field, and CORESET Pool ID.
- The structure and fields of the Enhanced TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE, including Serving Cell ID, BWP ID, Ci field, TCI state IDi,j, and Reserved bit.
- The mapping process of TCI states to codepoints and the maximum number of activated TCI states."
"How does the IMS support capability negotiation for IP multimedia sessions, and what specific aspects are involved in this process according to 3GPP TS 22.228?","The IMS supports capability negotiation for IP multimedia sessions at various stages, including invocation, acceptance, and during the session. This negotiation process involves several key aspects:

1. **Stages of Capability Negotiation**: Capability negotiation can occur at the time of session invocation, acceptance, and during the session. This allows for adjustments based on changes in user equipment (UE) capabilities or media types.

2. **User Profiles and Preferences**: The negotiation process takes into account information from the user profile, which includes preferences for IP multimedia applications. This ensures that the session can be routed to a specific UE when multiple UEs share the same IMS service subscription. In cases like Telepresence, the UE's capability to handle media (e.g., screen size, number of screens and cameras) is considered.

3. **Routing to Specific UEs**: The IMS can route IP multimedia sessions to specific UEs based on the user profile, ensuring that the session is delivered to the most appropriate device.

4. **Exchange of Information About Media Components**: The IMS allows IP multimedia applications to exchange information about negotiated media components. This enables the sending, receiving, or intermediate systems to make decisions about transmitting, selecting, and rendering media streams. For example, deciding which video stream to display on a particular screen or how to render audio streams to maintain spatial effects.

5. **Negotiation of Language(s) and Modalities**: The system supports negotiation of the user's desired language(s) and modalities (spoken, signed, written) per media stream and/or session. The service provider can pass language and modality information between endpoints, but no other actions are required from the service provider regarding this information.

6. **Interaction with User Profiles and Direct User Interaction**: Interaction with the user profile is supported, and direct interaction with the user may be required for incoming sessions to ensure that the session meets the user's preferences and capabilities.

7. **Addition or Deletion of Media Components**: During an IP multimedia session, users can negotiate the addition or deletion of media components, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on the session's needs.

Overall, the IMS provides a comprehensive framework for capability negotiation, ensuring that IP multimedia sessions are tailored to the user's preferences and device capabilities, while facilitating effective communication and media handling.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The stages at which capability negotiation can occur (invocation, acceptance, during the session).
  - The role of user profiles and preferences in capability negotiation.
  - The ability to route sessions to specific UEs based on user profiles.
  - The exchange of information about media components for transmission, selection, and rendering.
  - The negotiation of language(s) and modalities, and the service provider's role in this process.
  - Interaction with user profiles and direct user interaction for incoming sessions.
  - The ability to negotiate the addition or deletion of media components during a session."
Describe the states associated with the SGs interface in the VLR and the impact of receiving an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME.,"The states associated with the SGs interface in the VLR are SGs-NULL, LA-UPDATE-PRESENT, and SGs-ASSOCIATED. 

In the SGs-NULL state, there is no SGs association with an MME for the UE, and the VLR considers the UE to be IMSI detached for EPS services. No SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST messages are sent to the MME, and any message from the MME is ignored except SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST, SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION, and SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION. The VLR may initiate paging on the SGs interface if the 'Confirmed by Radio Contact' restoration indicator is set to 'false'.

In the LA-UPDATE-PRESENT state, the VLR has received an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message from the MME. The VLR may be waiting for the outcome of the Update Location procedure from the HSS if the IMSI is not known in the VLR. For UEs configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, the VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages via the SGs interface.

In the SGs-ASSOCIATED state, the VLR considers the UE to be attached to both EPS and non-EPS services. For UEs configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, the VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages via the SGs interface and can perform the MM information procedure.

Upon receiving an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME, the VLR is informed that all SGs associations with that MME for all UEs registered in the MME are no longer reliable due to the MME losing information about the state of the UEs. The VLR has two options:
1. Set the 'Confirmed by Radio Contact' restoration indicator to 'false' in all SGs associations containing the restarted MME and set the state of all SGs associations containing the restarted MME to the SGs-NULL state.
2. Keep the 'Confirmed by Radio Contact' restoration indication and the state of all SGs associations containing the restarted MME unchanged.

The VLR then sends an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message to the MME. If the 'Confirmed by Radio Contact' restoration indicator is 'false', the VLR may send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu interface.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The states associated with the SGs interface in the VLR (SGs-NULL, LA-UPDATE-PRESENT, SGs-ASSOCIATED).
  - The conditions and actions associated with each state.
  - The impact of receiving an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME.
  - The options available to the VLR upon receiving the SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message and the subsequent actions."
"What are the requirements for the modem circuit's transmitting characteristics, the demodulator's carrier levels, and the duty cycle variation for proper transmission of data bits according to the specified standards?","The modem circuit must be capable of managing its transmitting characteristics as outlined in the relevant standards. Specifically, the demodulator must meet the requirement for a carrier ON-Level within the range of +5 dBm to -12 dBm and a carrier OFF-Level less than -18 dBm. Levels between -12 dBm and -18 dBm are undefined. Additionally, to ensure proper transmission of data bits through modulation and demodulation processes, the duty cycle variation must adhere to the formula DCSYSTEM = |DCRX – DCTX| ≤ 10 %, where DCSYSTEM represents the difference between the duty cycles of the transmitted and received bit streams, DCTX is the duty cycle for the input bit stream, and DCRX is the duty cycle for the output bit stream. For transmission through a coaxial cable, two converters are required: one to convert the bit stream to OOK (modulator) and another to convert OOK back to a bit stream (demodulator). Each converter is allocated half of the total duty cycle tolerance. For an input bit stream with a duty ratio of 50 %, the cascaded modulator and demodulator must provide an output bit stream with a duty ratio within the limits of 40 % to 60 %, measured at 0.5 times peak amplitude. These requirements are crucial to ensure the integrity and proper transmission of data bits.","The answer must include the modem circuit's capability to manage its transmitting characteristics, the specific carrier levels required for the demodulator, the formula and limit for duty cycle variation, and the duty cycle tolerance for the cascaded modulator and demodulator. It should also explain the significance of these requirements in ensuring proper transmission of data bits."
Describe the process and requirements for handling a SIP SUBSCRIBE request for conference event status subscription in the participating MCPTT function.,"The process and requirements for handling a SIP SUBSCRIBE request for conference event status subscription in the participating MCPTT function are as follows:

1. **Conditions for Handling SIP SUBSCRIBE Request**:
   - The SIP SUBSCRIBE request must contain the ICSI value 'urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcptt' in a P-Asserted-Service header field.
   - The Accept header field must contain the 'application/conference-info+xml' MIME type.
   - The request must include an 'application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-info+xml' MIME body with the <mcptt-request-uri> set to a MCPTT group ID.

2. **Steps for Resolving Request-URI to MCPTT Session Identity**:
   - The participating MCPTT function attempts to resolve the received Request-URI to an existing MCPTT session identity.
   - If the Request-URI cannot be resolved, the function rejects the SIP SUBSCRIBE request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response and a warning text '137 the indicated group call does not exist'.
   - If resolved, the function generates a SUBSCRIBE request, sets the SIP URI in the Request-URI with the mapped MCPTT session identity, includes the <mcptt-calling-user-id> element set to the MCPTT ID of the served user, inserts a Record-Route header containing its own address, and sends the SIP SUBSCRIBE request.

3. **Actions Upon Receiving SIP Response to SUBSCRIBE Request**:
   - The participating MCPTT function copies the content of the incoming SIP response to the outgoing SIP response.
   - If a SIP 200 (OK) response is received, it includes in the Contact header field of the outgoing SIP response an MCPTT session identity mapped to the MCPTT session identity provided in the Contact header field of the received SIP 200 (OK) response.
   - The function forwards the SIP response.

4. **Handling SIP NOTIFY Requests and Responses**:
   - Upon receiving a SIP NOTIFY request within the dialog created by the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the function includes the public service identity of the MCPTT user in the Request-URI, copies the content of the incoming SIP NOTIFY request to the outgoing SIP NOTIFY request, and sends the SIP NOTIFY request.
   - Upon receiving a SIP response to the SIP NOTIFY request, the function copies the content of the incoming SIP response to the outgoing SIP response.
   - If a SIP 200 (OK) response is received, it includes an MCPTT session identity constructed from the MCPTT session identity provided in the Contact header field of the received SIP 200 (OK) response in the outgoing SIP response.
   - The function forwards the SIP response.

These steps ensure proper handling and communication of conference event status subscriptions within the MCPTT function, adhering to the specified protocols and procedures.","Key details the answer must include:
  - The specific conditions under which the SIP SUBSCRIBE request is processed (ICSI value, Accept header, MIME body)
  - The detailed steps the participating MCPTT function must follow to resolve the Request-URI to an MCPTT session identity
  - The actions required upon receiving SIP responses to the SUBSCRIBE request, including handling of SIP 200 (OK) responses
  - The procedures for handling SIP NOTIFY requests and their responses, including copying content and forwarding according to 3GPP TS 24.229"
"Describe the key elements and functionalities involved in media encoding and decoding as specified in the documents, focusing on video encoding and decoding models, slice trace formats, and the impact of various settings on media quality.","Media encoding and decoding involve several key elements and functionalities to meet application, service, and delivery requirements. Different encoding methods can significantly impact the bitrate, quality, delays, and error resilience of the media stream. Bitrate adjustments can be dynamic, based on content properties and network conditions, which in turn affect the quality of the media stream. Delays in the encoder or decoder due to processing or algorithmic functionalities can be configured, with longer delays typically resulting in better quality. Output data unit properties, such as the size of generated data units and packets, also play a role, with added constraints potentially increasing bitrates.

For video encoding, the content encoding and decoding models use V-Traces and feedback from the decoder to encode individual media samples or frames. The encoder produces a sequence of slices according to specific formats, and the decoding model generates V’-Traces for quality evaluation. Parameters for video encoding include the codec in use (e.g., H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC), encoding patterns (usage of B and P pictures), latency settings, rate control methods (CBR, capped VBR, CRF, CQP, feedback-based), slice settings (e.g., 1 slice per frame, 8 slices per video frame), intra settings and error resilience (regular IDR patterns, adaptive intra, feedback-based), and complexity settings for encoders.

The slice trace formats, S-Trace and S’-Trace, document the encoding and delivery of slices. The S-Trace format provides metadata for each generated slice, while the S’-Trace format shows the state of slices after delivery, including delays and corruption. The quality of the video is influenced by the percentage of lost area, with non-predicted coding units eventually removing damaged areas.

An algorithm for slice generation and decoding is detailed in Annex X, which models the generation of slices and the decoding of received slices. This algorithm considers the state of coding units in a video frame, determining whether they are correct or damaged based on their reception and prediction from non-damaged units. The overall quality of the video is thus dependent on the correct reception and prediction of coding units.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of different encoding methods and their impact on bitrate, quality, delays, and error resilience
  - Detailed description of video encoding and decoding models, including parameters and their effects
  - Importance of slice trace formats (S-Trace and S’-Trace) and frame-related metadata

Describe the performance measurements related to conditional handovers in 5GS as specified in TS 28.552 and TS 38.331.,"The performance measurements related to conditional handovers in 5GS, as specified in TS 28.552 and TS 38.331, include several key metrics:

1. **Outgoing Conditional Handover Candidates**:
   - **Inter-gNB**: This measurement provides the number of outgoing conditional handover candidates requested by the source gNB. The counters involved are NRCellCU and NRCellRelation, which are incremented based on the number of candidates configured in the conditionalReconfiguration IE and the number of relations present in the conditionalReconfiguration IE, respectively. This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic and is used for performance assurance.
   - **Intra-gNB**: Similar to inter-gNB, this measurement provides the number of outgoing intra-gNB conditional handover candidates requested by the source NRCellCU. The counters NRCellCU and NRCellRelation are incremented under the same conditions as the inter-gNB measurement. This is also valid for packet switched traffic and used for performance assurance.

2. **UEs Configured with Conditional Handover**:
   - **Inter-gNB**: This measurement provides the number of UEs that have been configured with conditional handover by the source gNB. The counter on NRCellCU is incremented by 1 for each UE configured, regardless of the number of RRCReconfiguration messages sent during a cell dwelling time. This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic and used for performance assurance.
   - **Intra-gNB**: This measurement provides the number of UEs configured with intra-gNB conditional handover by the source cell. The counter on NRCellCU is incremented by 1 for each UE configured, similar to the inter-gNB measurement. This is valid for packet switched traffic and used for performance assurance.

3. **Successful Handover Executions**:
   - **Intra-gNB**: This measurement provides the number of successful intra-gNB handover executions received by the source NRCellCU. The counter is incremented by 1 upon reception of the RRC ReconfigurationComplete message from the UE to the target NRCellCU, indicating a successful handover. This measurement is valid for packet switched traffic and used for performance assurance.

These measurements are crucial for monitoring and ensuring the performance of conditional handovers in 5GS networks.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The types of measurements (outgoing conditional handover candidates, UEs configured with conditional handover, successful handover executions).
  - The specific counters involved (NRCellCU, NRCellRelation).
  - The conditions under which these counters are incremented (transmission/reception of RRCReconfiguration messages).
  - The traffic type these measurements are valid for (packet switched traffic).
  - The usage of these measurements for performance assurance."
"Describe the procedure for Ethernet PDU session anchor relocation, including the roles of UPF, SMF, and the handling of Ethernet context information.","The procedure for Ethernet PDU session anchor relocation involves several steps and the coordination between different network functions, primarily the User Plane Function (UPF) and the Session Management Function (SMF). 

1. **Role of UPF**: The UPF that supports Ethernet PDU session relocation sets the ETHAR bit in the UP Function Features Information Element (IE). This bitmask indicates the features supported by the UPF, including the ability to handle Ethernet PDU session relocation. During the relocation process, the UPF updates its list of MAC addresses and possibly associated VLAN tags for the PDU session. This information is received from the old Ethernet PDU session anchor and is used to assist in updating Ethernet forwarding tables in the Data Network (DN).

2. **Significance of UP Function Features IE**: The UP Function Features IE is a bitmask where each bit set indicates a supported feature. The ETHAR bit within this bitmask specifically indicates support for Ethernet PDU session anchor relocation. Spare bits in the bitmask are ignored by the receiver, ensuring that only relevant features are considered.

3. **Detailed Procedure**:
   - Initially, the Ethernet PDU session is established with user data going through the Source UPF acting as the PDU Session Anchor (PSA).
   - The Source UPF reports the Ethernet context, which includes all Ethernet-specific information such as the MAC address of the User Equipment (UE) and possibly its VLAN tags, to the SMF. This reporting is done via N4 signaling.
   - The SMF determines when the serving PSA needs to be changed and selects the Target UPF to act as the new PSA. The SMF then establishes the N4 session at the Target UPF and sends the Ethernet context information to it.
   - Based on the Ethernet context, the Target UPF may update the Ethernet forwarding tables in the DN. This can be done through various mechanisms such as issuing Gratuitous ARP (GARP) messages, sending unsolicited Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Neighbor Advertisement messages, or generating uplink Ethernet frames with the UE's MAC addresses.
   - The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Target UPF, which includes the Ethernet context information and a trigger for updating the Ethernet forwarding. The Target UPF acknowledges this request.
   - The N4 session at the Source UPF is then released, and the Source UPF may wait for a configurable period before stopping the delivery of downlink Ethernet frames for the given PDU session. The release of the N4 session is acknowledged by the Source UPF to the SMF.

Throughout this process, the SMF plays a crucial role in managing the session and ensuring that the Ethernet context is accurately reported and updated, while the UPFs handle the actual data forwarding and context updates.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The role of UPF in setting the ETHAR bit and updating MAC addresses and VLAN tags during relocation.
  - The significance of the UP Function Features IE and its bitmask representation.

"What are the key measurements defined in 3GPP TS 32.425 for IP throughput in E-UTRAN, and how are they obtained according to TS 36.314?","The key measurements defined in 3GPP TS 32.425 for IP throughput in E-UTRAN include both the volume and time duration of data bursts in downlink and uplink. 

For downlink, the volume of a data burst is measured excluding the data transmitted in the TTI when the buffer is emptied. This measurement is applicable to eNodeBs serving one or more Relay Nodes (RNs), and packets transmitted between the E-UTRAN and RNs are excluded. The measurement name format is DRB.IPVolDl.QCI, where QCI identifies the E-RAB level quality of service class. Similarly, the time duration to transmit a data burst in downlink is measured excluding the last piece of data transmitted in the TTI when the buffer is emptied, with the measurement name format being DRB.IPTimeDl.QCI.

For uplink, the volume of a data burst is measured excluding the data transmitted in the TTI when the buffer is emptied. This measurement is also applicable to eNodeBs serving one or more RNs, and packets transmitted between the E-UTRAN and RNs are excluded. The measurement name format is DRB.IPVolUl.QCI. The time duration to transmit a data burst in uplink is measured excluding the last piece of data transmitted in the TTI when the buffer is emptied, with the measurement name format being DRB.IPTimeUl.QCI.

These measurements are obtained according to the definitions in 3GPP TS 36.314, which aim to measure IP throughput over Uu independent of traffic patterns and packet size. The measurements are mainly intended for data bursts large enough to require transmissions to be split across multiple TTIs. Initial buffering time in UE or eNB is excluded from these measurements. Separate counters are maintained for each QCI, and the measurements support the Integrity KPI 'E-UTRAN IP Throughput'.","The answer should cover the following key details:
  - The specific measurements for IP throughput in E-UTRAN as defined in TS 32.425, including both volume and time duration for data bursts in downlink and uplink.

"Describe the process and criteria for Transport Format Combination (TFC) selection in the UE, including the handling of power limitations and logical channel priorities.","The process of Transport Format Combination (TFC) selection in the User Equipment (UE) involves several steps and criteria to ensure efficient data transmission while adhering to power limitations and logical channel priorities.

Firstly, the UE must limit the usage of transport format combinations when it estimates that the required power for a certain TFC exceeds the maximum transmit power. This is crucial for maximizing network coverage. When the UE has more than one activated uplink frequency, it must estimate the power allocation for all activated frequencies and select the Enhanced Transport Format Combination (E-TFC) accordingly.

The scheduling of uplink data is controlled by the Radio Resource Control (RRC) by assigning priorities to logical channels, ranging from 1 (highest priority) to 8 (lowest priority). The UE must perform TFC selection based on these priorities, ensuring that higher priority data is transmitted first. TFCs can be in one of three states: Supported, Excess-power, or Blocked. The UE continuously monitors the state of each TFC based on its required transmit power versus the maximum UE transmit power.

For a TFC to be considered valid, it must:
1. Belong to the Transport Format Combination Set (TFCS).
2. Not be restricted by higher layer signaling.
3. Not be in the Blocked state.
4. Be compatible with the Radio Link Control (RLC) configuration.
5. Not require RLC to produce padding PDUs.
6. Not carry more bits than can be transmitted in a Transmission Time Interval (TTI).

The UE may remove TFCs in the Excess-power state to maintain the quality of service for sensitive applications, such as speech. Additionally, if compressed frames are present, the UE may remove TFCs to account for higher power requirements.

The chosen TFC must satisfy the following criteria in order:
1. No other TFC should allow the transmission of more highest priority data.
2. No other TFC should allow the transmission of more data from the next lower priority logical channels, applied recursively for remaining priority levels.
3. No other TFC should have a lower bit rate than the chosen TFC.

Parameters such as Buffer Occupancy (BO), Number of PDUs, PDU Size, and RLC Entity Info are critical for TFC selection. These parameters help the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer perform TFC selection by indicating the amount of data available for transmission and the configuration of RLC entities.

In summary, TFC selection in the UE is a complex process that involves managing power limitations, adhering to logical channel priorities, and considering various parameters to ensure efficient and prioritized data transmission.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of UE in limiting transport format combinations based on power requirements.
- The priority-based scheduling of uplink data controlled by RRC.
- The states of TFCs and the criteria for selecting a valid TFC.
- The importance of parameters like Buffer Occupancy, Number of PDUs, PDU Size, and RLC Entity Info in the TFC selection process."

"Describe the key aspects of Fault Management (FM) in 3GPP systems, including the role of alarm surveillance and the characteristics of effective alarm notifications.","Fault Management (FM) in 3GPP systems is a critical aspect of network management aimed at detecting failures as soon as they occur and minimizing their impact on the network's Quality of Service (QoS). The primary objectives of FM include detecting failures, alerting operating personnel promptly, isolating and reconfiguring faulty network elements, diagnosing the cause of failures, and repairing or eliminating them in a timely manner. FM also involves the administration of pending alarms, presentation of operational state information, and analysis of alarm and state history.

Alarm surveillance plays a vital role in FM as the first line of Network Management Assurance Activity, often maintained in near real-time. Its primary function is to alert operating personnel when failures occur, ensuring that alarms are of operational relevance to avoid wasting time and resources on irrelevant notifications. Operator response to alarms involves several steps: recognizing, acknowledging, verifying, obtaining enhanced information, analyzing the situation, taking necessary actions, and continuing surveillance to ensure fault correction.

Effective alarm notifications are crucial for efficient FM. They should possess characteristics such as relevance (not spurious or of low operational value), uniqueness (not duplicating another alarm), timeliness (not too early or too late), importance (indicating the need for operator action), explicability (clear and easy to understand), recognizance (identifying the problem), guidance (indicative of the action to be taken), and prioritization (drawing attention to the most important issues). These characteristics ensure that operators can manage alarms effectively, preventing alarm flooding and maintaining control of the network.","The answer should cover the definition and purpose of Fault Management (FM) in 3GPP systems, including the steps involved in detecting, isolating, diagnosing, and repairing failures.

"How do the 3GPP TS 45.912 specifications address the transmission over multiple carriers, RLC window size limitations, and the necessary changes to RLC/MAC headers for EGPRS and DSR?","The 3GPP TS 45.912 specifications provide detailed guidelines for transmission over multiple carriers, addressing several key aspects. Firstly, it is suggested that a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) can span over two carriers, similar to how it spans over multiple timeslots. The same Temporary Flow Identity (TFI) can be used across all carriers, although different TFIs can be used if necessary. However, RLC limitations may arise if the total number of timeslots exceeds eight, as discussed in subclause 7.5.2.4.

Regarding RLC window size limitations, the specifications highlight the need for the RLC window size to accommodate the maximum number of outstanding RLC data blocks within the RLC roundtrip time. If the window size is too small, it can limit peak throughput. The current maximum RLC window size for EGPRS (1024) is suitable for multi-carrier transmission, except in cases where Abis transport involves a geo-stationary satellite hop, which significantly increases the roundtrip time. For GPRS, the maximum RLC window size (64) is too small, thus restricting multi-carrier usage to EGPRS.

The specifications also outline necessary changes to the RLC/MAC headers for EGPRS and DSR. For EGPRS, the uplink RLC/MAC header type-1 can be reused for the two lowest DSR Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs) without adding new bytes. However, for the three highest DSR MCSs, additional modifications are required, including two octets to indicate block sequence numbers (BSN3, BSN4) and five bits to enhance the Coding and Puncturing Scheme indicator field (CPS). The EGPRS MCS Information Element (IE) needs to be enhanced by one bit to accommodate DSR MCSes. The current maximum RLC window size for EGPRS should also apply to DSR and dual carrier scenarios. Furthermore, EGPRS link adaptation may be enhanced for DSR by adding new rules for MCS selection for retransmission, with and without re-segmentation, to enable incremental redundancy and ensure optimal performance.","The answer should cover the method of allowing transmission over multiple carriers, including the use of TBF and TFI. It should explain the RLC window size requirements and limitations, particularly in the context of EGPRS and GPRS, and the impact of roundtrip time. Additionally, it should detail the necessary changes to the RLC/MAC headers for EGPRS and DSR, including the re-use of existing headers and the specific additions required for higher DSR MCSs. The answer should also touch on the enhancements to EGPRS link adaptation for DSR and the applicability of current RLC window sizes."
"Describe the MIMO operation and signaling procedures for HS-DSCH in a cell, focusing on the use of CPICH, precoding control indication (PCI), and transport block scheduling.","The MIMO operation and signaling procedures for HS-DSCH in a cell involve several key steps and components. Firstly, the UE uses the Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) to separately estimate the channels seen from each antenna. For Antenna 1, the modulation pattern of the Primary CPICH (P-CPICH) is used, while Antenna 2 can transmit either the modulation pattern of the Secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) or the P-CPICH. If Dual CPICHs (D-CPICHs) are activated, Antennas 3 and 4 will transmit the modulation pattern of the D-CPICH within Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) where the High-Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) is scheduled for a UE configured for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas. The UE uses these D-CPICHs as additional phase references to estimate the channels for HS-PDSCH demodulation.

The pilot configuration supporting MIMO operation of HS-DSCH in the cell is signaled by higher layers. The UE determines a preferred primary precoding vector and signals it to the Node B. This signaled information, termed precoding control indication (PCI), is combined with channel quality indication (CQI) into a composite PCI/CQI report, which is transmitted to the Node B using the CQI field on the High-Speed Dedicated Physical Control Channel (HS-DPCCH). For configurations involving four transmit antennas, the UE also determines the number of transport blocks preferred (NTBP) and includes this in the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI report.

Based on these composite reports, the Node B scheduler decides whether to schedule one, two, three, or four transport blocks in a cell to a UE in one TTI, and determines the transport block sizes and modulation schemes for each. The Node B signals the scheduled transport blocks and the precoding weights applied on the HS-PDSCH sub-frame using the precoding weight indication bits of part 1 of the corresponding High-Speed Shared Control Channel (HS-SCCH) sub-frame. The precoding weight adjustment for each HS-PDSCH is done at the HS-PDSCH sub-frame border. For UEs with dual stream capability, the Node B should not schedule more than two transport blocks.

In summary, the MIMO operation and signaling procedures for HS-DSCH involve the use of CPICH for channel estimation, signaling of pilot configurations by higher layers, determination and signaling of PCI and NTBP by the UE, composite report transmission using HS-DPCCH, and the Node B's decision-making and signaling processes regarding transport blocks and precoding weights.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of how the UE uses CPICH to estimate channels from each antenna.

"Describe the structure and mapping of AMR codec frames as defined in 3GPP TS 26.101, including the Frame Type field, AMR Core Frame, and octet alignment in AMR Interface Format 2.","The structure and mapping of AMR codec frames in 3GPP TS 26.101 involve several key components: the Frame Type field, AMR Core Frame, and octet alignment in AMR Interface Format 2 (AMR IF2).

1. **Frame Type Field**: The 4-bit Frame Type field is crucial in defining the type of frame being used. It can indicate one of the eight AMR codec modes, one of four different comfort noise frames, or an empty frame. Additionally, three Frame Type Indices are reserved for future use. The same table that defines the Frame Type field is reused for the Mode Indication and Mode Request fields, which are 3-bit fields each and are defined in the range 0…7 to specify one of the eight AMR codec modes.

2. **AMR Core Frame**: The AMR Core Frame is described separately for speech bits and comfort noise bits. The structure of the AMR Core Frame varies depending on whether it contains speech or comfort noise bits, as detailed in subclause 4.2.

3. **AMR Interface Format 2 (AMR IF2)**: AMR IF2 is an octet-aligned frame format for the AMR codec, useful in connection with applicable ITU-T H-series recommendations. The AMR IF2 frame is formed by concatenating the 4-bit Frame Type field and the AMR Core Frame. The length of the AMR Core Frame field depends on the particular Frame Type. Since the total number of bits in the AMR IF2 speech frames in different modes is typically not a multiple of eight, bit stuffing is required to achieve an octet structure.

4. **Bit Mapping Examples**: Specific tables provide detailed examples of bit mapping for different AMR modes and Frame Types. For instance, Table A.1a shows how the AMR 6.7 kbit/s mode is mapped into AMR IF2. The four least significant bits (LSBs) of the first octet consist of the Frame Type for the AMR 6.7 kbit/s mode, followed by 134 AMR Core Frame speech bits, resulting in a total of 138 bits. Six bits are needed for bit stuffing to reach the closest multiple of eight, which is 144 bits. Other tables, such as Table A.1b, specify the composition of AMR IF2 frames for all Frame Types, and Tables A.2 to A.6 detail the mapping of comfort noise bits and empty frames.

In summary, the structure and mapping of AMR codec frames in 3GPP TS 26.101 involve the interpretation of the Frame Type field, the detailed structure of the AMR Core Frame, and the octet alignment in AMR IF2, with specific examples provided for different modes and Frame Types.","The answer should include:

How should the Destination-Host and Destination-Realm values be extracted from the DiameterURI for various AVPs as specified?,"The process of extracting the Destination-Host and Destination-Realm values from the DiameterURI for various AVPs involves the following steps:

1. **Primary-Event-Charging-Function-Name AVP**: This AVP contains the address of the Primary Online Charging Function. The receiving network element should extract the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) from the DiameterURI in this AVP. The FQDN should be used as the content of the Destination-Host AVP for Diameter accounting requests. The parent domain of the FQDN should be used as the Destination-Realm.

Describe the process and requirements for handling configuration changes and adaptive switching in MPEG-H 3D Audio as specified in 3GPP TS 26.118.,"In MPEG-H 3D Audio, handling configuration changes and adaptive switching are crucial for maintaining audio quality and synchronization. 

For configuration changes, the decoder must detect and handle changes in the MHAS (MPEG-H Audio Stream) stream. This detection is typically done by observing changes in the MHASPacketLabel of the packet type PACTYP_MPEGH3DACFG compared to previous MHAS packets. When a configuration change is detected, the decoder must perform the change according to ISO/IEC 23008-3, clause 5.5.6. Additionally, if MHAS packets of type PACTYP_AUDIOTRUNCATION are present, they should be used as described in ISO/IEC 23008-3, clause 14. These truncation messages enable synchronization between video and audio streams at program boundaries, allowing for sample-accurate splicing and reconfiguration of the audio stream.

For adaptive switching in a DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) environment, MPEG-H 3D Audio supports seamless bitrate switching between different Representations of the same content within the same Adaptation Set. When the decoder receives a DASH Segment from another Representation within the same Adaptation Set, it must perform an adaptive switch according to ISO/IEC 23008-3, clause 5.5.6. This ensures that the audio quality remains consistent despite changes in bitrate.

In summary, handling configuration changes involves detecting changes in MHASPacketLabel and using PACTYP_AUDIOTRUNCATION packets for synchronization, while adaptive switching in DASH requires seamless transitions between different bitrates within the same Adaptation Set, both guided by specific clauses in ISO/IEC 23008-3.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of how configuration changes are detected and handled in MHAS streams.
  - Description of the role and usage of PACTYP_AUDIOTRUNCATION packets for synchronization and splicing.
  - Details on seamless bitrate switching in DASH environment and handling different Representations within the same Adaptation Set.
  - References to relevant clauses in ISO/IEC 23008-3 [19] for both configuration changes and adaptive switching."
"Describe the process and key elements involved in configuring, terminating, and notifying dynamic group configurations in the VAE server as per 3GPP TS 29.486 specifications.","The process of configuring dynamic group information in the VAE server involves several key steps and elements. Firstly, the NF service consumer, such as a V2X application-specific server, sends an HTTP POST request to the VAE server to create an 'Individual Group Configuration'. This request must include the GroupConfigurationData data structure in the payload body, which contains attributes such as 'groupId', 'definition', 'leaderId', and 'notifUri', with an optional 'duration' attribute. Upon receiving this request, the VAE server performs authorization based on the provided information. If successful, the VAE server creates a new resource representing the 'Individual Group Configuration' and responds with a 201 Created message, including the URI for the created resource in the Location header. The NF service consumer uses this URI for subsequent requests.

The resource URI for dynamic group configurations follows the structure defined in TS 29.486, specifically {apiRoot}/vae-dynamic-group/<apiVersion>/group-configurations, which supports various resource URI variables.

Error handling procedures for HTTP POST and DELETE requests are specified in clause 6.4.7 of TS 29.486. If errors occur during these processes, the VAE server applies these procedures to manage the errors appropriately.

To terminate a dynamic group configuration, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP DELETE request to the VAE server, targeting the URI of the 'Individual Group Configuration' resource. The VAE server checks if the resource exists and, if so, deletes it and responds with a 204 No Content message. If the resource does not exist or errors occur during the deletion process, the VAE server applies the error handling procedures.

For notifying dynamic group changes, the VAE server sends an HTTP POST request to the 'notifUri' provided by the NF service consumer. This request includes the DynamicGroupNotification data structure, which contains attributes such as 'resourceUri', 'joinedUeIds', and 'leftUeIds'. Upon receiving this notification, the NF service consumer responds with a 204 No Content message for successful processing. If errors occur, the NF service consumer sends an HTTP error response as specified in the error handling procedures.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the key requirements and considerations for small cell enhancements as outlined in 3GPP TS 36.932, focusing on deployment scenarios, backhaul types, mobility support, coverage flexibility, performance, cost, complexity, and security.","The key requirements and considerations for small cell enhancements as outlined in 3GPP TS 36.932 are as follows:

- **Deployment Scenarios**: Small cell enhancements should target both scenarios with and without macro coverage, including both outdoor and indoor small cell deployments. Both ideal and non-ideal backhaul should be considered, and deployments should account for both sparse and dense small cell configurations.

- **Backhaul Types**: There are two main types of backhaul to consider: ideal backhaul, which includes very high throughput and very low latency connections such as dedicated point-to-point optical fiber connections, and non-ideal backhaul, which includes typical market solutions like xDSL, microwave, and relaying. The performance-cost trade-off should be taken into account, and necessary information exchange between nodes should be identified to achieve desired improvements.

- **Mobility Support**: Small cell enhancements should support mobility for various deployment scenarios, including future spectrum use in higher frequency bands. For UEs served on a macro layer and mobile speeds up to 30 km/h, small cell nodes need to be discovered and mobility performed efficiently with low UE power consumption. Mobility across densely deployed small cells and between macro and small cells on the same frequency layer should be targeted for good performance at speeds up to 30 km/h. Enhancements for higher speeds (e.g., 50-80 km/h) can be studied in future items, and the benefits of allowing high-speed UEs in small cells should be evaluated.

- **Coverage Flexibility**: Small cell enhancements should provide flexible coverage for both uplink and downlink to support a variety of deployment scenarios.

- **Performance, Cost, and Complexity**: Small cell enhancements should satisfy required performance while minimizing cost and complexity. This includes allowing for low network cost solutions, low-cost deployment, and reduced base station implementation costs. System complexity should be minimized to stabilize the system and decrease terminal and network costs. Considerations should include minimizing the number of options, avoiding redundant mandatory features, and limiting the number of necessary test cases.

- **Security**: The small cell enhancement area architecture should maintain a comparable level of security to Release 10/11 E-UTRA and E-UTRAN for the deployment scenarios described.

1. **MS initiated GA-PSR Transport Channel activation**:
   - The MS GA-PSR starts in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state, where the GA-PSR Transport Channel does not exist. When the LLC layer requests the transfer of uplink LLC-PDUs, the MS initiates the activation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel.
   - The MS sends a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the GANC, including the MS UDP port number for downlink transfer.
   - The GANC responds with a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC ACK message, providing the IP address and UDP port number for uplink data transfer. The MS then transitions to the GA-PSR-ACTIVE state.
   - The MS forwards the LLC-PDU to the GANC using the provided IP address and UDP port via a GA-PSR UNITDATA message. The GANC forwards the LLC-PDU to the core network, and the MS restarts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.
   - If the GANC receives downlink user data for the MS while the GA-PSR TC is active, it sends the LLC-PDU to the MS using the GA-PSR UNITDATA message with the associated GA-PSR Transport Channel information.

2. **Network initiated signalling/SMS**:
   - The Core Network sends a GMM/SM signalling or SMS message to the GANC via the Gb interface, which may include messages like GMM attach accept or SM PDP context activation accept.
   - The GANC encapsulates the received LLC-PDU within a GA-PSR DATA message and forwards it to the MS via the existing TCP connection.

3. **MS initiated signalling/SMS**:
   - The MS GA-PSR receives a request from the LLC layer to transfer an uplink GMM/SM signalling message or SMS message, such as a GMM attach request or SM PDP context activation message.
   - The MS GA-PSR encapsulates the LLC-PDU within a GA-PSR DATA message, including necessary parameters for Gb interface procedures, and forwards the message to the GANC.
   - The GANC then forwards the message to the Core Network following standard Gb interface procedures.

4. **Packet Paging for GPRS**:
   - The Core Network sends a PAGING PS message for a mobile station that is currently GPRS attached via the GAN, containing the IMSI and possibly the P-TMSI.
   - The GANC identifies the MS registration context using the IMSI and pages the MS using the GA-PSR PS PAGE message on the existing TCP signalling connection. The message includes the P-TMSI if provided, otherwise the IMSI.
   - The mobile station responds to the page by sending any LLC-PDU, activating the GA-PSR TC if needed. The uplink LLC-PDU is forwarded to the GANC using the GPRS data or signalling transfer mechanism.
   - The GANC forwards the LLC-PDU to the Core Network via standard Gb interface procedures.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - For MS initiated GA-PSR Transport Channel activation: the steps involved in negotiating IP address and UDP port numbers, the transition of MS GA-PSR states, and the forwarding of LLC-PDUs.

"Describe the test purpose, applicability, and procedure for verifying intra-frequency SS-SINR measurement accuracy in NR UE supporting E-UTRA and EN-DC from Release 15 onwards.","The purpose of the test is to verify that the intra-frequency SS-SINR measurement accuracy is within the specified limits for all bands. This test applies to all types of NR UE supporting E-UTRA and EN-DC from Release 15 onwards, which support ss-SINR-Meas. The minimum conformance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 clause A.4.7.3.1.

The initial conditions for the test involve configuring the test equipment and the Device Under Test (DUT) according to the parameters specified in the relevant tables. Specifically, Cell 1 is the E-UTRA serving cell (PCell) for the EN-DC setup, while Cell 2 and Cell 3 are NR FR1 cells in the same frequency, with Cell 2 being the PSCell and Cell 3 the target cell for SS-SINR measurements.

The test procedure includes several steps:
1. Ensure the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state with specific generic procedure parameters.
2. Set the parameters according to the appropriate table.
3. The SS shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message on Cell 1.
4. The UE shall transmit an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE shall periodically transmit MeasurementReport messages.
6. After a 10-second wait from Step 3, the SS shall check the SS-SINR reported values in the periodic MeasurementReport. The SS-SINR value of Cell 3 reported by the UE is compared to the expected SS-SINR. If the value is outside the specified limits or the UE fails to report the measurement value for Cell 3, the number of failed iterations is increased by one. Otherwise, the number of passed iterations is increased by one.
7. The SS shall continue checking the MeasurementReport messages transmitted by the UE until the confidence level specified in the relevant table is achieved.
8. Set the parameters according to each sub-test and repeat steps 5-7.

The accuracy requirements for intra-frequency SS-SINR measurements are defined in TS 38.533 clause 4.7.3.0.1. These requirements are valid under specific conditions, including those defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 for reference sensitivity and conditions for intra-frequency measurements according to clause B.2.2 for a corresponding band. The reporting range of SS-SINR and CSI-SINR is defined from -23 dB to 40 dB with 0.5 dB resolution, and the mapping of measured quantity is specified in the relevant table. The normative reference for these requirements is TS 38.133 clauses 10.1.12.1.1 and 10.1.16.","The answer should include the purpose of the test, which is to verify the intra-frequency SS-SINR measurement accuracy within specified limits for all bands.

The answer should also reference the relevant clauses for conditions and procedure parameters."
Describe the procedures and mechanisms involved in managing subscriber data and temporary identifiers in a Super-Charged network as per 3GPP TS 23.116.,"In a Super-Charged network, managing subscriber data and temporary identifiers involves several procedures and mechanisms to ensure efficient operation and avoid issues such as double allocation of identifiers.

Firstly, the procedure Purge_MS_in_Serving_Network_Entity is used to determine whether a Super-Charged Serving Network Entity should send the purge MS message to the Home Location Register (HLR) when deleting inactive subscription data. If the HLR does not support Super-Charger functionality, the deletion of inactive subscription data initiates the purge MS procedure. For the CS-domain, restoration procedures are modified to minimize unnecessary mobile terminated call and short message attempts. For the PS-domain, attempts to establish a network-requested PDP context to a network entity without a subscriber record proceed as described in 3GPP TS 23.060. Additionally, the Mobile Terminating Short Message Service is modified to reduce unnecessary attempts.

Subscription data in a Super-Charged network should not be deleted in the previous network entity but retained using spare capacity. This can lead to continuous growth of the database size, requiring a strategy to manage capacity. Example mechanisms include utilizing a larger database, implementing a periodic audit scheme, or removing old subscriber information to make room for new users.

When a request for a roaming number is received and there is no subscriber data record, the network entity must distinguish between data loss due to a network entity restart or removal by the Super-Charger database management function. If the data was lost due to a restart, the restoration procedure described in 3GPP TS 29.002 is initiated. The Check_Reason_In_Serving_Network_Entity procedure determines if the data was removed by the Super-Charger function and whether to return Purged MS diagnostic information to the HLR. The Super_Charged_SRI_Error_HLR procedure determines if the HLR should mark its data for the MS as purged, treating any request for routing information as if the MS is not reachable.

To avoid double allocation of temporary identifiers like TMSI and P-TMSI, these values must be de-allocated if cancel location or purge MS procedures are not performed. The send identification procedure described in 3GPP TS 29.002 can be used for explicit de-allocation. If this procedure is not performed, alternative mechanisms such as supervision timers or database management functions can be used. The chosen mechanism for de-allocation is an implementation detail.

Overall, managing subscriber data and temporary identifiers in a Super-Charged network involves careful coordination of deletion, retention, restoration, and de-allocation procedures to maintain network efficiency and prevent issues.","The answer should cover the procedures for deleting inactive subscription data and the conditions under which these procedures are initiated. It should explain the strategies for managing database capacity in a Super-Charged network, including example mechanisms. The handling of requests for roaming numbers and the distinction between lost and removed subscriber data records should be detailed, along with the relevant procedures. Finally, the answer should describe the mechanisms for de-allocating temporary identifiers to avoid double allocation, including the use of the send identification procedure and alternative mechanisms."
What are the requirements for a UE to identify new detectable intra-frequency cells in FDD and TDD modes when no DRX is in use?,"The requirements for a UE to identify new detectable intra-frequency cells in both FDD and TDD modes when no DRX is in use are quite similar, with some specific details for each mode.

For both FDD and TDD modes:
- The UE must be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within 1000 ms (Tbasic_identify_E-UTRA_FDD_eICIC, intra for FDD and Tbasic_identify_E-UTRA_TDD_eICIC, intra for TDD).
- A cell is considered detectable when certain conditions related to RSRP and RSRQ are fulfilled, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 9.1.2.3, 9.1.2.4, and 9.1.5.2, along with SCH_RP and SCH Ês/Iot conditions according to the relevant annexes (Annex I.2.8 for FDD and Annex B.2.8 for TDD).
- In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurement period for intra-frequency measurements is 200 ms.
- The UE must be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements for 8 identified intra-frequency cells, including those not measured in subframes indicated by the time-domain measurement resource restriction pattern. The UE physical layer must be capable of reporting these measurements to higher layers within the 200 ms measurement period.
- When measurement gaps are activated, the UE must be capable of performing measurements for at least Ymeasurement_intra_eICIC cells, where Ymeasurement_intra_eICIC is defined by a specific equation. If more than Ymeasurement_intra_eICIC cells are identified, the UE must still perform measurements for at least 8 identified cells, but the reporting rate may be decreased.

Regarding measurement reporting delay:
- The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event triggering a measurement report and the point when the UE starts transmitting the report over the air interface. This delay excludes uncertainties caused by inserting the report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH and delays due to lack of UL resources.
- The event-triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering, must be less than Tidentify_intra_eICIC. Additional delays can be expected when L3 filtering is used or IDC autonomous denial is configured.
- If a cell becomes undetectable for ≤ 5 seconds and then detectable again, triggering an event, the reporting delay must be less than TMeasurement_Period_eICIC, Intra, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than 50 Ts and L3 filtering has not been used. Additional delays can be expected with L3 filtering or IDC autonomous denial.

These requirements are referenced in 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 8.1.2.8.1 and A.8.1.7 for FDD, and clauses 8.1.2.8.2 and A.8.2.5 for TDD.","The answer should cover:
  - The commonalities and differences in the identification requirements for FDD and TDD intra-frequency cells.
  - The specific time periods (Tbasic_identify_E-UTRA_FDD_eICIC, intra and Tbasic_identify_E-UTRA_TDD_eICIC, intra).
  - The conditions under which a cell is considered detectable (RSRP, RSRQ, SCH_RP, SCH Ês/Iot).
  - The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements in RRC_CONNECTED state (200 ms).
  - The UE's capabilities for performing and reporting measurements (RSRP and RSRQ for 8 identified cells).
  - The measurement reporting delay requirements and conditions (event triggered measurement reporting delay, L3 filtering, IDC autonomous denial).

How is the modulation order and transport block size determined for NPDSCH in NB-IoT according to 3GPP TS 36.213?,"The modulation order and transport block size for NPDSCH in NB-IoT are determined based on several conditions and steps outlined in 3GPP TS 36.213.

To determine the modulation order:
1. If the UE is configured with higher layer parameter npdsch-16QAM-Config and the DCI is mapped onto the UE specific search space given by C-RNTI, or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter pur-DL-16QAM-Config and the DCI is mapped onto the UE specific search space given by PUR-RNTI, and the 4-bit 'modulation and coding scheme' field in the DCI is set to '1111', the modulation order is set to 4.
2. Otherwise, the modulation order is set to 2.

To determine the transport block size:
1. First, if NPDSCH carries SystemInformationBlockType1-NB, the UE sets the transport block size to the value of the parameter schedulingInfoSIB1 configured by higher layers.
2. If NPDSCH uses 16QAM, the UE reads the 4-bit 'modulation and coding scheme for 16QAM' field in the DCI. Depending on the value of the higher layer parameter operationModeInfo or inbandCarrierInfo-r13, the transport block size is set accordingly.
3. Otherwise, the UE reads the 4-bit 'modulation and coding scheme' field in the DCI and sets the transport block size.

Second, if NPDSCH carries SystemInformationBlockType1-NB, the transport block size is determined using Clause 16.4.1.5.2, which refers to specific tables for FDD and TDD carriers:
- Table 16.4.1.5.2-1 for FDD
- Table 16.4.1.5.2-2 for TDD NB-IoT carrier on which NPSS/NSSS/NPBCH are detected
- Table 16.4.1.5.2-3 for a higher layer configured TDD NB-IoT carrier

Otherwise, the UE reads the 3-bit 'resource assignment' field in the DCI and determines the transport block size using the procedure in Clause 16.4.1.5.1, which refers to Table 16.4.1.5.1-1.

For NPDCCH UE-specific search space:
- If the UE is configured with higher layer parameter twoHARQ-ProcessesConfig, or npdsch-MultiTB-Config and a single TB is scheduled in the corresponding DCI, the NDI and HARQ process ID as signalled on NPDCCH, and the transport block size as determined above, are delivered to higher layers.
- Otherwise, the NDI as signalled on NPDCCH, and the transport block size as determined above, are delivered to higher layers. If multiple TBs are scheduled, the HARQ process ID of 0 is for the first TB and HARQ process ID of 1 is assumed for the second TB. Otherwise, HARQ process ID of 0 is assumed.","The answer must include the conditions under which different modulation orders are used, the steps for determining transport block size including references to specific tables for FDD and TDD carriers, and the handling of NPDCCH UE-specific search space. It should also mention the higher layer parameters that influence these decisions."

"What are the requirements for spurious response and out-of-band blocking in 3GPP TS 25.101, and how do they differ across various frequency ranges?","In 3GPP TS 25.101, out-of-band blocking and spurious response are critical parameters for ensuring the receiver's ability to handle unwanted signals without significant degradation. 

Out-of-band blocking is defined as the receiver's ability to reject unwanted interfering signals that fall more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band. The Bit Error Rate (BER) for out-of-band blocking should not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 7.7. For frequency ranges 1, 2, and 3, up to 24 exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1 MHz step size. For frequency range 4, up to 8 exceptions are allowed under the same measurement conditions. These exceptions must meet the requirements specified in clause 7.7.

Spurious response measures the receiver's ability to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted continuous wave (CW) interfering signal at any other frequency where a response is obtained. This is applicable when the out-of-band blocking limit specified in subclause 7.6.2 is not met. The BER for spurious response should also not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 7.8.

Additionally, subclause 7.7.2 specifies that the Block Error Rate (BLER) measured on each individual cell should not exceed 0.1 for the parameters specified in Table 7.8A. This requirement is not applicable for dual uplink operation. The spurious response requirements reference multiple subclauses (7.6.2A to 7.6.2F) for out-of-band blocking limits.

In summary, while both out-of-band blocking and spurious response aim to ensure receiver performance in the presence of unwanted signals, they differ in their specific requirements and the number of exceptions allowed across different frequency ranges.","The answer should include the definition of out-of-band blocking and spurious response, the BER and BLER requirements, the frequency ranges and exceptions for spurious response frequencies, and the specific subclauses referenced for out-of-band blocking limits. It should also highlight the differences in requirements across various frequency ranges."
Describe the performance and challenges of DTMF signal detection in GSM Half Rate codec transmission based on the 3GPP TS 46.008 specifications.,"DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency) signals are defined to represent numeric keys, certain characters, and special symbols using pairs of sine waves at specific frequencies. According to the 3GPP TS 46.008 specifications, each DTMF digit consists of two simultaneous sine signals: one from a low-frequency group and one from a high-frequency group. These signals must be detected accurately by DTMF receivers, even in noisy conditions or when speech is present, without misinterpreting other voice band signals.

The performance of DTMF signal detection in GSM Half Rate codec transmission was evaluated through various tests. The tests involved generating DTMF signal files with different pulse and pause durations and amplitude levels, processing them with HR-codec software, and inputting the results into DSP-based hardware with standard DTMF recognition software. The experiments aimed to assess the recognition accuracy under different conditions.

The results showed significant challenges in DTMF signal detection. Even under ideal conditions with nominal frequencies and error-free transmission, the recognition was poor after processing. Only at a relatively high level of -12 dB and a tone length of 80 ms was 100% recognition achieved. Under other conditions, at least one tone showed severe recognition problems. The recognition of very short tones (40 ms) was particularly problematic, and longer tones (120 ms) also faced issues.

One major challenge identified was the time-dependent twist generated by the GSM Half Rate codec, where the amplitude difference between the two components of the DTMF signal exceeded the allowed range of 6 dB. This non-linear behavior led to detection errors, such as double detections or missed tones. For example, in one experiment with -12/-18 dB signals and 120 ms tones, 10 inputs of ","The answer should cover the definition and composition of DTMF signals, the requirements for DTMF receivers, the experimental setup used for testing, and the results of the tests. It should explain the challenges faced in detecting DTMF signals, such as issues with twist, signal length, and amplitude levels. The answer should also compare the performance of standard and modified DTMF detectors, noting any improvements and remaining issues."
Describe the error handling procedures for Information Elements (IEs) in URCMP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 29.674.,"The error handling procedures for Information Elements (IEs) in URCMP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 29.674 involve several key aspects based on the presence requirements of the IEs. These presence requirements include Mandatory, Conditional, Conditional-Optional, and Optional IEs.

Mandatory IEs must be included by the sending entity, and if they are missing, the receiver diagnoses a 'Mandatory IE missing' error and responds with the type of the missing IE. Conditional IEs are included if specific conditions are met, and the receiver checks these conditions to determine if the IE should be expected. If a necessary Conditional IE is missing, the receiver aborts the procedure. Conditional-Optional IEs are included if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met, but the receiver does not need to check their presence, and their absence does not trigger error handling procedures. Optional IEs may be included or not, and their absence or erroneous content is handled as specified in clause 7.6.

For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of embedded IEs follows specific rules based on the presence requirement of the grouped IE. If the grouped IE is Mandatory, the embedded IEs follow the stated requirements within the Mandatory grouped IE. If the grouped IE is Conditional, embedded IEs are viewed as Conditional, Conditional-Optional, or Optional based on their individual requirements. Similar rules apply for Conditional-Optional and Optional grouped IEs.

Protocol errors are defined as messages or IEs received with unknown types, unexpected content, or erroneous content. The term 'silently discarded' means that the receiving entity discards such messages or IEs without further processing. This ensures forward compatibility, allowing new Conditional-Optional or Optional IEs to be safely included by the sending entity, while legacy receiving entities discard them and continue processing.

If a protocol error is detected, the receiving entity should log the event and may include the error in a statistical counter. For response messages containing a rejection Cause value, the Cause IE must be included regardless of other mandatory or conditional IEs. If the erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding URCMP message, retransmissions are stopped, and the application layer is notified of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.","The answer should cover the different presence requirements for IEs (Mandatory, Conditional, Conditional-Optional, Optional) and their implications for error handling. It should explain how grouped IEs are handled based on their presence requirements. The answer should also describe the concept of protocol errors, the conditions under which IEs are silently discarded, and the procedures for logging and handling protocol errors, including the handling of erroneous reply messages."
Describe the different types of DPCH power measurements in TDD mode as specified in 3GPP TS 32.405.,"The 3GPP TS 32.405 specifies four types of DPCH power measurements in TDD mode:

What are the key elements and configurations involved in DCI format 2_7?,"DCI format 2_7 is used for notifying the paging early indication and TRS availability indication for one or more UEs. The key elements of DCI format 2_7 include the following fields:

1. Paging indication field: This field consists of bits where the number of bits is determined by the higher layer parameter po-NumPerPEI, which defines the number of paging occasions. Additionally, the number of sub-groups of a paging occasion is configured by the higher layer parameter subgroupsNumPerPO.

"Explain the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure as specified in TS 36.425, including the key parameters involved and their significance.","The Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure, as specified in TS 36.425, is designed to provide feedback from the Secondary eNodeB (SeNB) to the Master eNodeB (MeNB) to enable the MeNB to control the downlink user data flow via the SeNB for the respective E-RAB. The SeNB may also transfer uplink user data for the concerned E-RAB to the MeNB along with a DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame within the same GTP-U PDU.

When the SeNB decides to trigger the Feedback for Downlink Data Delivery procedure, it reports the following key elements:
a) The highest PDCP PDU sequence number successfully delivered in sequence to the UE among those PDCP PDUs received from the MeNB.
b) The desired buffer size in bytes for the concerned E-RAB.
c) The minimum desired buffer size in bytes for the UE.
d) The X2-U packets that were declared as being 'lost' by the SeNB and have not yet been reported to the MeNB within the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame. (Note: This element is not applicable if the E-UTRAN deployment has decided not to use the Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure.)

The DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame also includes an indication of whether the frame is the last DL status report received during the release of a bearer from the SeNB. The value range for this parameter is {0=Frame is not final, 1=Frame is final}, and its field length is 1 bit.

Upon receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame, the MeNB:
- Regards the desired buffer size and minimum desired buffer size as the amount of data desired from the SeNB.
- Uses the PDCP sequence number reported within the same frame, as well as the most recently reported PDCP sequence numbers of all other E-RABs established for the UE, to determine the momentary desired buffer sizes.
- Is allowed to remove the buffered PDCP PDUs according to the feedback of successfully delivered PDCP PDUs.
- Decides upon the necessary actions for PDCP PDUs reported as other than successfully delivered.

Additionally, it should include the value ranges and field lengths for the parameters indicating the final frame, desired buffer size, and minimum desired buffer size."
Describe the procedures for on-demand based usage of location information history reporting from the location management client to the location management server as outlined in TS 23.280.,"The procedures for on-demand based usage of location information history reporting from the location management client to the location management server as outlined in TS 23.280 involve several steps and pre-conditions.

Pre-conditions:
1. The location management client is configured to store location information while not reporting it to the location management server.
2. The location management client has stored location information based on triggering criteria in cases where it is not reporting location information.

Procedure (Document 1):
1. The location management client returns to report location information while there is a communication link between the location management client and the location management server.
2. The location management server requests the stored location information.
   - Note 1: The location management client may provide the status of the stored location information prior to the request from the location management server.
3. The location management client responds to the location management server with one or several stored location information history reports.
   - Note 2: The transmission of requested stored location information does not interrupt the reporting of location information.
   - Note 3: The most recent stored location information that qualifies for transmission is transmitted first.
   - Note 4: The transmission may be stopped at any time with the cancel location history reporting procedure, according to the procedure described in clause 10.9.3.9.4.
4. The location management server updates the available location information with one or several stored location information and the optional MC service UE label, if present, from the location management client.

Procedure with MC service server or location management client 2 involvement (Document 3):
1. The MC service server or the location management client 2 initiates the location information history request to the location management server.
   - Note: The MC service server or the location management client 2 may request the status on stored location information from location management client 1, prior to the location information history request.
2. The location management server checks the authorization of this request and compares the location information history request with the already retrieved stored location information from location management client 1.
3. The location management server requests stored location information from location management client 1 according to the procedure described in clause 10.9.3.9.2.1, if the desired stored location information is not available on the location management server.

"Explain the relationship between Test System uncertainties, Test Requirements, and Test Tolerances as defined in 3GPP TS 36.141. How do these elements interact to ensure accurate testing of Base Stations (BS) supporting E-UTRA and NB-IoT operations?","In 3GPP TS 36.141, the relationship between Test System uncertainties, Test Requirements, and Test Tolerances is crucial for ensuring accurate testing of Base Stations (BS) supporting E-UTRA and NB-IoT operations.

Test System uncertainties refer to the maximum acceptable uncertainty levels for the Test System, which must be within specified tolerances to ensure reliable measurements. These uncertainties are absolute values valid for a confidence level of 95%, meaning that 95% of the performance of a population of test equipment falls within this interval. For RF tests, these uncertainties apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not account for system effects due to mismatch between the Device Under Test (DUT) and the Test System.

Measurement results from the Test System are compared directly against the Test Requirements, which are defined by the Shared Risk principle. This principle ensures that the actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for each parameter is included in the test report and must be equal to or lower than the figures specified in subclause 4.1.2. If the Test System has a higher measurement uncertainty than specified, adjustments are made to tighten the Test Requirements, making the test harder to pass. This ensures that a non-compliant Test System does not increase the chance of passing a DUT that would otherwise fail with a compliant Test System.

Test Requirements are derived from Minimum Requirements using Test Tolerances, which account for Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements, and system performance criticality. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test Requirement matches the Minimum Requirement. For non-zero Test Tolerances, the Test Requirements differ from the Minimum Requirements, and excess Test System uncertainty is subtracted from the defined test tolerance to generate tightened Test Requirements. For example, if a Test System has a 0.9 dB uncertainty for a test with a 0.7 dB tolerance, the excess 0.2 dB is subtracted, resulting in a new test tolerance of 0.5 dB.

These principles specifically apply to BS supporting E-UTRA and NB-IoT operations, ensuring that testing is accurate and reliable despite potential uncertainties in the Test System.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The definition and importance of Test System uncertainties and the 95% confidence level.
  - How measurement results are compared to Test Requirements and the role of the Shared Risk principle.
  - The process of including actual measurement uncertainty in test reports and the adjustments made for higher uncertainties.
  - The derivation of Test Requirements from Minimum Requirements using Test Tolerances, including examples of how excess Test System uncertainty affects Test Requirements.
  - The specific applicability of these principles to BS supporting E-UTRA and NB-IoT operations."
"Describe the procedures and configurations the UE must follow upon entering RRC_INACTIVE state according to TS 36.331, and outline the frequency ranges and band combinations for NR operations as specified in TS 38.101.","Upon entering the RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE must follow several procedures and configurations as specified in TS 36.331. These include resetting the MAC and releasing the default MAC configuration if any, stopping all timers except T302, T309, T320, T323, T325, and T330, and re-establishing RLC entities for all SRBs and DRBs. If the RRCConnectionRelease message includes the waitTime, the UE must start timer T302 with the value set according to the waitTime and inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories '0' and '2'. If T309 is running, the UE must stop timer T309 for all access categories and perform actions specified in clause 5.3.16.4. The UE must apply the received rrc-InactiveConfig, derive the DRX cycle as specified in TS 36.304 clause 7.1, and handle context information updates if the RRCConnectionRelease message was received in response to an RRCConnectionResumeRequest. Additionally, the UE must store context information, start timer T380 if the periodic-RNAU-timer is included, suspend all SRBs and DRBs except SRB0, indicate PDCP suspend to lower layers of all DRBs, indicate the suspension of the RRC connection to upper layers, and enter RRC_INACTIVE while performing procedures specified in TS 36.304 clause 5.2.7. Upon selecting an inter-RAT cell or switching to another CN type, the UE must perform actions upon leaving RRC_INACTIVE as specified in clause 5.3.12 with release cause 'other'.

Regarding NR operations, TS 38.101 outlines the frequency ranges and band combinations. The channel arrangements are based on the operating bands and channel bandwidths defined in the current release of specifications. The frequency ranges in which NR can operate are identified in Table 5.1-1, which includes FR1, FR2-1, and FR2-2. Whenever FR2 is referred to, both FR2-1 and FR2-2 frequency sub-ranges are considered unless otherwise stated. The specification covers band combinations that include at least one FR1 operating band and one FR2 operating band for carrier aggregation and dual connectivity operations, as well as at least one E-UTRA operating band for dual connectivity operations.","The answer should detail the specific actions the UE must take upon entering RRC_INACTIVE state, including the handling of timers, RLC entities, and context information. It should also explain the frequency ranges and band combinations for NR operations, highlighting the distinctions between FR1 and FR2, and the requirements for carrier aggregation and dual connectivity."

   - `0` indicates no interworking encountered, used for TMR = 64 kBit/s unrestricted to avoid sending a progress indicator that might cause call release by an ISDN terminal.

6. **End-to-end Information Indicator (Bit J)**: 
   - `0` indicates no end-to-end information available.

7. **ISDN User Part/BICC Indicator (Bit K)**: 
   - `0` indicates ISDN user part not used all the way.
   - `1` indicates ISDN user part/BICC used all the way, used for TMR = 64 kBit/s unrestricted to avoid sending a progress indicator that might cause call release by an ISDN terminal.

8. **Holding Indicator (Bit L)**:

Describe the specifications and requirements for using JSON and multipart messages in 3GPP TS 29.577 and TS 29.500.,"The specifications and requirements for using JSON and multipart messages in 3GPP TS 29.577 and TS 29.500 are detailed as follows:

1. **JSON Format Usage**:
   - The JSON format, as described in IETF RFC 8259, is mandated for use as the content type 'application/json' for HTTP bodies. This is specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500.
   - For indicating additional details of errors in HTTP response bodies, the 'Problem Details' JSON object is used with the content type 'application/problem+json', as defined in IETF RFC 7807.

2. **Multipart Messages**:
   - Multipart messages are supported to transfer large parts of opaque binary data along with JSON format. The media type used for multipart messages is 'multipart/related'.
   - These multipart messages include:
     - One JSON body part with the content type 'application/json'.
     - One binary body part with 3GPP vendor-specific content subtypes, as defined in Table 6.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 29.577.
   - The JSON body part is the 'root' body part of the multipart message and is encoded as the first body part. The 'type' parameter specifies the media type of the root body part as 'application/json'.
   - The binary body part includes a Content-ID header, and the JSON body part references the binary body part using this Content-ID header field.

3. **Service Operations**:
   - HTTP multipart messages are specifically supported in the MtForwardSm service operation to transfer opaque SMS payloads, such as SMS messages and CP Ack.
   - Examples of multipart/related messages can be found in Annex B of TS 29.577.

"Describe the process and actions taken by the transmission control interface towards the MCVideo client in the transmission control server upon receiving unauthorized RTP media packets, including the subsequent state transitions and message contents.","Upon receiving an indication from the network media interface that RTP media packets with payload are received from the associated transmission participant, the transmission control interface towards the MCVideo client in the transmission control server undertakes several actions. Firstly, it requests the network media interface in the MCVideo server to not forward the received RTP media packets to the media distributor in the MCVideo server. This is to ensure that unauthorized media packets are not propagated further within the system.

Next, the transmission control interface sends a Transmission Revoke message to the associated transmission participant. This message includes the Reject Cause field with the value set to #3, indicating 'No permission to send a Media Transmission'. Additionally, if the group call is a broadcast group call, a system call, an emergency call, an imminent peril call, or a temporary group session, the Transmission Indicator field is included with appropriate indications to specify the nature of the call.

Following the sending of the Transmission Revoke message, the transmission control interface enters the 'U: not permitted but sends media' state. In this state, the transmission control interface starts timer T3 (Transmission Revoke) and ensures that RTP media packets from the MCVideo client are not forwarded to the media distributor in the MCVideo server. This state transition and the associated actions are crucial for maintaining control over media transmissions and preventing unauthorized media packets from being distributed within the MCVideo server.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The initial action of requesting the network media interface to not forward RTP media packets.
  - The contents and fields of the Transmission Revoke message, including the Reject Cause and Transmission Indicator fields.
  - The transition to the 'U: not permitted but sends media' state and the actions taken in this state, such as starting timer T3 and not forwarding RTP media packets."
What are the minimum conformance requirements for Category M1 and M2 UEs in the context of random access procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The minimum conformance requirements for Category M1 and M2 UEs in the context of random access procedures are detailed in 3GPP TS 36.521. These requirements include the ability to calculate PRACH transmission power according to the PRACH power formula defined in TS 36.213 clause 6.1 and apply this power level at the first preamble or additional preambles. The absolute power applied to the first preamble must have the accuracy defined in Table 6.3.5.1.1-1 of TS 36.101, and the relative power applied to additional preambles must have the accuracy specified in Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 of TS 36.101.

Category M1 UEs must indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers if the maximum number of preamble transmission counter has been reached for the random access procedure on PCell or PSCell, as specified in clause 5.1.4 of TS 36.321. They must stop preamble transmission if the maximum number of preamble transmission counter has been reached for the random access procedure on an activated Scell, also specified in clause 5.1.4 of TS 36.321.

Additionally, Category M1 UEs may stop monitoring for Random Access Responses and must transmit msg3 if the Random Access Response contains a Random Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble. They must re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH transmission power when the back off time expires if all received Random Access Responses contain Random Access Preamble identifiers that do not match the transmitted Random Access Preamble or if no Random Access Response is received within the RA Response window defined in clause 5.1.4 of TS 36.321.

Category M1 UEs must re-transmit msg3 upon the reception of a NACK on msg3 and send an ACK if the Contention Resolution is successful. They must re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH transmission power when the back off time expires unless the received message includes a UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC control element and the UE Contention Resolution Identity matches the CCCH SDU transmitted in the uplink message. They must also re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH transmission power when the back off time expires if the Contention Resolution Timer expires.

Per TS 36.133 clause 6.2.3, in addition to the requirements defined in TS 36.133 clauses 6.2.1 and 6.2.2, Category M1 UEs must execute the random access procedure defined in clause 5.1 of TS 36.321 using the PRACH configuration contained in PRACH-ConfigSIB in TS 36.331. This includes determining the enhanced coverage level based on the RSRP measurement and the configured criterion (RSRP-ThresholdsPrach in TS 36.331), selecting PRACH resources configured for the corresponding enhanced coverage level, and transmitting or re-transmitting PRACH preamble using the selected PRACH resources and PRACH configuration.

The normative references for these requirements are TS 36.133 clauses 6.2.2.1, 6.2.3, 7.1.2, and A.6.2.13. The test parameters are provided in Tables 6.2.13.5-1, 6.2.13.5-2, and 6.2.13.5-3 for Category M1 UEs and in Tables 6.2.14.5-1, 6.2.14.5-2, and 6.2.14.5-3 for Category M2 UEs.","The answer should cover the minimum conformance requirements for Category M1 and M2 UEs, including the normative references and specific clauses from TS 36.133.

"Explain the process and requirements for QoS monitoring in a 5G network, including the role of UPF, SMF, NEF, and AF, as specified in the 3GPP documents.","In a 5G network, QoS monitoring is a critical function to ensure the quality of service for various flows. The User Plane Function (UPF) plays a central role in this process. When the UPF is requested to perform QoS monitoring by the Session Management Function (SMF), it selects downlink payload packets for the requested QoS flows or creates dummy downlink GTP-U packets if no payload packets are available. These dummy packets do not contain a T-PDU and are used solely for monitoring purposes. The UPF inserts timestamps and sets the QoS Monitoring Packet (QMP) flag to '1' along with the corresponding QoS Flow Identifier into the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header.

Upon receiving uplink packets related to the requested QoS flows, the UPF measures packet delays based on the timestamps and packet delays included in the extension header. If the packet delays exceed defined thresholds and event-triggered reporting is required, the UPF generates a QoS monitoring report to the SMF. The UPF may also perform periodic reporting based on the measurement period. These reports include delay values for downlink, uplink, and round trip measurements.

The SMF provides instructions to the UPF regarding thresholds, minimum wait times, and measurement periods. If new thresholds are received, the UPF adjusts its ongoing measurements accordingly. The UPF continues monitoring until instructed otherwise by the SMF.

Additionally, the UPF may be instructed to report QoS monitoring events directly to a local Network Exposure Function (NEF) or Application Function (AF). This is indicated by setting the Direct Reporting of QoS monitoring events (DRQOS) flag in the UP Function Feature IE. The SMF includes Direct Reporting Information IE in the Session Report Request (SRR), specifying the Event Notification URI and, if available, the Notification Correlation ID. If events need to be sent to both the local NEF or AF and the SMF, the Reporting Flags IE with the DUPL flag set to '1' is included.

The PDU Session Container extension header is transmitted in G-PDUs over various user plane interfaces, including N3 and N9, between NG-RAN and UPF or between two UPFs. Dummy GTP-U packets for QoS monitoring are forwarded by intermediate UPFs along with the extension header to the next GTP-U entity. The content of the PDU Session Container is specified in the relevant 3GPP documents.

Overall, the process involves careful coordination between the UPF, SMF, NEF, and AF to ensure accurate QoS monitoring and reporting in a 5G network.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The role of UPF in selecting downlink payload packets and creating dummy GTP-U packets for QoS monitoring.
  - How timestamps and QoS Monitoring Packet flags are inserted into packets.

  - The handling of periodic and event-triggered QoS monitoring reporting.
  - Instructions from SMF regarding thresholds, minimum wait time, and measurement periods.
  - Direct reporting of QoS monitoring events to local NEF or AF, including the setting of DRQOS flag and inclusion of Direct Reporting Information IE.
  - Transmission and forwarding of PDU Session Container extension headers in G-PDUs, and the use of dummy GTP-U packets for QoS monitoring."
"Describe the procedures and mechanisms involved when a Network Element does not receive a reply from the Charging Data Function (CDF) in response to an Accounting Request (ACR) message, including retransmission and duplicate detection processes.","When a Network Element does not receive an Accounting Answer (ACA) in response to an Accounting Request (ACR) message, it may retransmit the ACR message. The waiting time until a retransmission is sent and the maximum number of repetitions are both configurable by the operator. If the maximum number of retransmissions is reached and still no ACA reply has been received, the Network Element executes the CDF connection failure procedure.

Retransmitted ACR messages are marked with the T-flag as described in RFC 6733 to allow duplicate detection in the CDF. The duplicate detection mechanism involves the CDF checking if a received message marked as retransmitted has already been received. If it has, the duplicate message is discarded. If the original message was not yet received, the information in the marked retransmitted message is used for generating the Charging Data Record (CDR). CDRs are marked if information from duplicated messages is used.

This process ensures that the Network Element can handle situations where ACA replies are not received, while also preventing duplicate messages from affecting the accuracy of the generated CDRs.","The answer should include the following key details:
  - The procedure for retransmitting ACR messages when no ACA reply is received, including configurable waiting time and maximum number of repetitions.
  - The marking of retransmitted ACR messages with the T-flag for duplicate detection.
  - The duplicate detection mechanism, including how the CDF handles retransmitted messages and discards duplicates.
  - The impact on CDR generation when information from duplicated messages is used."
"Compare the procedures for initiating and releasing an MCPTT private call in off-network mode, highlighting the differences between automatic and manual commencement modes.","The procedures for initiating and releasing an MCPTT private call in off-network mode differ based on whether the call is initiated using automatic or manual commencement modes. 

For initiating an MCPTT private call using automatic commencement mode (Document 1), the procedure involves the following steps:
1. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a private call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2. MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request to MCPTT client 2, which includes an SDP offer, an automatic commencement mode indication, and a request for the floor. Location information may also be included.
3. MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming call.
4. MCPTT client 2 automatically accepts the call and sends a call setup response indicating successful call establishment to MCPTT client 1. If the call is rejected, a failure reason is sent instead.
5. The media plane for communication is established, and MCPTT client 1 is automatically granted the floor.

For initiating an MCPTT private call using manual commencement mode (Document 2), the procedure involves the following steps:
1. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a private call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2. MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request to MCPTT client 2, which includes an SDP offer, a manual commencement mode indication, and a request for the floor. Location information may also be included.
3. MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming call.
4. MCPTT client 2 sends a ringing message to MCPTT client 1.
5. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 manually accepts the call via the user interface. The user may also reject or fail to answer the call.
6. MCPTT client 2 sends a call setup response indicating successful call establishment to MCPTT client 1. If the call is rejected or not answered, a failure reason is sent instead.
7. The media plane for communication is established, and MCPTT client 1 is automatically granted the floor.

The pre-conditions for both procedures are that the MCPTT user profile used for off-network operation mode is pre-provisioned in the MCPTT UEs.

The procedure for releasing an ongoing MCPTT private call (Document 3) is applicable to both commencement modes and involves the following steps:
1. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a call release to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2. MCPTT client 1 sends a call release request to MCPTT client 2.
3. MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the call release.
4. MCPTT client 2 sends a call release response indicating successful call release to MCPTT client 1.
5. Both MCPTT clients release all associated media plane resources.

The pre-condition for the call release procedure is that two MCPTT users are currently engaged in an off-network MCPTT private call.

"Describe the procedure for transferring resource information from the BSS to the MSC, including the different methods and their respective behaviors.","The procedure for transferring resource information from the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) to the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) involves several methods, each with specific conditions and behaviors. These methods are defined as follows:

1. **Method i) Spontaneous resource information expected**: The BSS sends the first RESOURCE INDICATION message without any resource information immediately as an acknowledgment to the RESOURCE REQUEST message. Subsequent RESOURCE INDICATION messages are sent spontaneously whenever conditions defined by Operations & Maintenance (O&M) are met, such as traffic thresholds or time intervals. If the O&M conditions are met, the BSS may use the Periodicity Information Element (IE) received in the RESOURCE REQUEST message to determine the time interval between indications, except when the Periodicity IE is set to zero, in which case it is ignored. The BSS remains in this mode until a new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell is received or a reset occurs.

2. **Method ii) One single resource information expected**: The BSS returns a single RESOURCE INDICATION message with some resource information immediately. If the RESOURCE REQUEST message does not contain an Extended Resource Indicator IE, the BSS ceases any further resource information transfer related to the cell until a new RESOURCE REQUEST message or a reset is received. If the RESOURCE REQUEST message contains an Extended Resource Indicator IE, the BSS follows the 'Subsequent Mode' field.

3. **Method iii) Periodic resource information expected**: The BSS returns a RESOURCE INDICATION message with some resource information immediately and then periodically, with a period set by the MSC. The period is determined by the periodicity parameter times 100 ms. If the periodicity parameter is zero, the message is treated as containing an incorrect value, and the BSS follows the procedures for handling incorrect information elements. The BSS remains in this mode until a new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell is received or a reset occurs.

4. **Method iv) No resource information expected**: The BSS immediately returns a single RESOURCE INDICATION message without any resource information as an acknowledgment to the RESOURCE REQUEST message. The transfer of resource information related to the cell is disabled until a new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell or a reset is received. This is the default mode after a reset.

The coding of the Resource Indication parameter to select the method is as follows:
- 0000: Method i) is selected.
- 0001: Method ii) is selected.
- 0010: Method iii) is selected.
- 0011: Method iv) is selected.

For method ii, the Total Accessible Resource Requested field is coded as:
- 0: No extra resource information is requested.
- 1: The total number of accessible channels is requested.

The Subsequent Mode field for method ii is decoded as:
- 0: Method iv) is selected.
- 1: If the reporting mode prior to receipt of this IE was method i) or iii), the subsequent mode remains the same; otherwise, method iv) is selected.

Handling of incorrect or out-of-sequence information elements is particularly relevant for method iii when the periodicity parameter is zero. In such cases, the recipient may either reject the message or ignore the incorrect field and treat the remaining information.

Overall, the transfer of resource information from the BSS to the MSC is governed by the selected method and the associated conditions and behaviors, ensuring efficient communication and resource management.","The answer should include:
- A description of the four methods (i, ii, iii, iv) for transferring resource information from the BSS to the MSC, including the conditions and behaviors associated with each method.
- Explanation of how the periodicity parameter is coded and interpreted for methods i and iii, and the handling of zero values.
- Details on how incorrect or out-of-sequence information elements are managed, especially for method iii.
- Coding of the Total Accessible Resource Requested field and Subsequent Mode field for method ii.
- Coding of the Resource Indication parameter to select the appropriate method."
"Describe the procedure for initiating a group regroup using a preconfigured MCPTT group, including the preconditions, steps involved, and the conditions under which the regrouping remains in effect.","The procedure for initiating a group regroup using a preconfigured MCPTT group involves several preconditions and steps. 

Preconditions:
- MCPTT client 2 is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1, and MCPTT client 3 is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 2.
- The MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the regroup MCPTT group have been preconfigured in MCPTT clients 2 and 3, and they have received the relevant security-related information to communicate in the regroup MCPTT group.
- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured regroup procedure.
- MCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured regroup group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MCPTT UEs of the group members who will be regrouped.
- The MCPTT server is subscribed to the group configuration in the Group Management Server (GMS) to be aware of whether the group is regrouped.
- The GMS has subscribed group dynamic data from the MCPTT server using the procedures defined in TS 23.280.

Steps involved:
1. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped (MCPTT groups 1 and 2), the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group, and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken.
2. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT server.
3. The MCPTT server checks the authorization of MCPTT client 1 to initiate the procedure, resolves the group identities of the requested MCPTT groups, and checks the affiliation of group members to MCPTT groups 1 and 2. The server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if not already known. It also ensures that none of the requested groups are already regrouped.
4. If any of the groups requested for regrouping have been regrouped by other procedures, the MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup reject back to MCPTT client 1 with a reject reason, terminating the procedure.
5. If the request is not rejected, the MCPTT server sends preconfigured regroup requests to MCPTT clients 2 and 3.
6. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping.
7. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send preconfigured regroup responses to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action.
8. The MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT clients to the regroup group.
9. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MCPTT client 1.

Persistence of regrouping:
The regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure specified in the relevant subclause. MCPTT client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the client is no longer affiliated with any of the regrouped groups. Affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE's MCPTT service ceases, such as when the UE is powered down or by performing a log-off operation. Data persistence in the MCPTT client following a user log-off or power down requires further study.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Preconditions for initiating the regroup procedure, including the affiliation of MCPTT clients to their respective groups and authorization of MCPTT client 1.
  - Step-by-step description of the regroup procedure, starting from the initiation by MCPTT client 1 to the final response from the MCPTT server.
  - Conditions under which the regroup request may be rejected.
  - Persistence of the regrouping effect and conditions under which it may be terminated, including the impact of user log-off or power down."
Describe the encryption protection algorithm selection process and the specific encryption requirements for EMSDP messages.,"The encryption protection algorithm for EMSDP messages is selected by the Home Subscriber Entity (HSE) using the EMSDP Session Start message. Encryption is mandatory for all control plane and user plane messages when an encryption algorithm other than EEA0 is selected by the HSE, except for specific control plane commands when no valid keyset is agreed between the User Equipment (UE) and HSE. These exceptions include the EMSDP session request command originating from the UE or the HSE, and the EMSDP start session command originating from the HSE.

For all other messages, specific fields indicated in the data stack for EMSDP transfers must be encrypted. The encryption process involves computing several inputs, including the message Counter Value (expanded and right padded to a fixed size of 4 bytes), the length of the message (coded on 2 bytes), the fields marked for encryption protection concatenated in the order they appear in the data packet, the DIRECTION bit (set to '0' for UE to HSE data packets and '1' for HSE to UE data packets), the BEARER value (set to '00000' for signaling data packets and '10101' for user plane data packets), the FRAMETYPE value (set to '00' for control plane messages and 'AA' for user plane messages), and the agreed encryption key value truncated to the lowest 128 bits (KI128 or CK).

The specific encryption algorithm used depends on the HSE BEST protocol ID element. If GEA4 is indicated, the algorithm specified in 3GPP TS 55.241 is used. If GEA5 is indicated, the algorithm specified in 3GPP TS 55.251 is used. If UEA1 is indicated, the algorithm specified in 3GPP TS 35.201 is used. If UEA2 is indicated, the algorithm specified in 3GPP TS 35.215 is used. If 128-EEA0 is indicated, the NULL algorithm specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 Annex B.0 is used.

"Describe the interaction scenarios between Next-Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) and Next Generation Networks (NGN) as outlined in 3GPP TS 24.523, including the service levels and specific scenarios presented.","The interaction scenarios between Next-Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) and Next Generation Networks (NGN) as outlined in 3GPP TS 24.523 encompass various service levels and specific scenarios. 

Firstly, the document identifies different scenarios for enabling interactions between NGCN and NGN, detailing the architectural and functional requirements necessary to support these interactions. These scenarios are expected to evolve with future releases as new requirements emerge.

The concept of service provision is divided into three levels:
1. **IP Connectivity**: This is the most basic level of service provision, where the NGN acts as a Transport Service Provider (TSP). It offers IP connectivity with improved or guaranteed quality of service or security, differentiating it from standard Internet services.
2. **Session Establishment and Control**: At this level, the NGN acts as a Session Service Provider (SSP), adding value by being involved in the signaling protocol used to establish and control media sessions, primarily using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Services include intelligent routing, quality of service for media, gateway services to legacy networks, and assistance in traversal.
3. **Application Level**: Here, the NGN acts as an Application Service Provider (ASP), providing applications that monitor or control multimedia sessions or involve media, such as conferencing services, transcoding, translation services, presence services, call logging, and UA configuration services. These applications are applied on top of session level services and may be accessed through session control protocols like SIP.

The document is structured based on these service level categories:
- **Clause 6**: Scenarios related to IP connectivity level services, such as IP level virtual leased line services between NGCN sites or between an NGCN site and a remote NGCN UE.
- **Clause 7**: Scenarios related to session establishment and control of communication session services, including session level virtual leased lines.
- **Clause 8**: Scenarios related to application level services, including hosted enterprise services (HES), subscription-based business trunking, and peering-based business trunking.
- **Clause 9**: Scenarios related to session level roaming services, which are distinct from other session level services. This includes the ability for an NGCN user to roam into an NGN with which the NGCN has a roaming agreement.

Additionally, the document provides details on functional entity diagrams and connection arrangements for corporate networks. It explains that services can be provided at the session establishment and control level or at the application level, and that corporate networks can be connected over interfaces to either a P-CSCF (subscription-based arrangement) or an IBCF (peering-based arrangement).

Overall, the interaction scenarios between NGCN and NGN are comprehensive, covering various service levels and specific scenarios to ensure seamless integration and service provision.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Overview of the interaction scenarios between NGCN and NGN.
  - Description of the three service provision levels: IP connectivity, session establishment and control, and application level.
  - Specific scenarios for each service level as outlined in the document structure.
  - Explanation of session level roaming services.
  - Details on functional entity diagrams and connection arrangements for corporate networks."

"Describe the requirements and procedures for generating and transmitting records for Lawful Interception (LI) in UMTS networks, including the impact of supplementary services and the handling of complex call scenarios.","The requirements and procedures for generating and transmitting records for Lawful Interception (LI) in UMTS networks are detailed in several key areas:

1. **Types of Events and Reports**: Records for LI are generated based on specific events and reports. Thirteen different event types are received at the DF2 level, and a Record is sent to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) for each event if required. LALS reports, which are not associated with an event, are also sent to the LEMF without the event parameter. The structure of these records and the mapping between event types and record types are provided in tables such as Table 5.4 and Table 5.5.

2. **Structure and Parameters of Records**: The records used for transmitting information from the mediation function to the LEMF can be extended in various servers if necessary.

"Describe the security architecture and mechanisms within the OAM&P domain as defined in 3GPP TS 32.371, including the security objectives, threats, and mechanisms used to counter these threats.","The security architecture within the OAM&P domain, as defined in 3GPP TS 32.371, is part of a broader security scope that is partitioned into four distinct domains: User, Network, OAM&P, and Security Management. The focus of the document is specifically on the OAM&P domain and the Itf-N component within this domain.

The OAM&P domain encompasses management tools to supervise all nodes of a cellular network. Security within this domain includes protection of operation and maintenance traffic, authentication of users and applications, and access control to the nodes. It aims to protect network elements and management applications from both intentional and unintentional destructive manipulation.

Security objectives within the network are defined by ITU-T Recommendation M.3016 and include:
- Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
- Data integrity: Protecting information from being altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
- Accountability: Ensuring that actions can be traced to the entity responsible for them.
- Availability: Ensuring that information and resources are accessible when needed.

Security threats, as identified by ITU-T Recommendation M.3016 and X.800, include:
- Masquerade: An entity pretends to be another entity.
- Eavesdropping: Unauthorized interception of information.
- Unauthorized access: Gaining access to resources without permission.
- Loss or corruption of information: Information is lost or altered.
- Repudiation: Denial of involvement in a communication.
- Forgery: Creation of false information.
- Denial of service: Subversion of service delivery.

To counter these threats, ITU-T Recommendation X.800 defines several security mechanisms, which include:
- Peer entity authentication: Verifying the identity of entities involved in communication.
- Data origin authentication: Ensuring the source of data is authentic.
- Access control service: Restricting access to resources.
- Connection confidentiality: Protecting data during transmission.
- Connectionless confidentiality: Protecting data in a connectionless environment.
- Selective field confidentiality: Protecting specific fields within data.
- Traffic flow confidentiality: Protecting the flow of data.
- Connection integrity with recovery: Ensuring data integrity with recovery options.
- Connection integrity without recovery: Ensuring data integrity without recovery options.
- Selective field connection integrity: Ensuring integrity of specific fields within data.
- Connectionless integrity: Ensuring integrity in a connectionless environment.
- Selective field connectionless integrity: Ensuring integrity of specific fields in a connectionless environment.
- Non-repudiation Origin: Preventing denial of data origin.
- Non-repudiation Delivery: Preventing denial of data delivery.

The Itf-N Security Management Context within the OAM&P domain involves various types of communication links, such as two-way links for requests and responses, one-way links for notifications, and two-way links for file downloads and uploads. Securing these communication links and their end-points (IRPManager and IRPAgent) is crucial to protect them from unauthorized use. The requirements focus on these specific links and entities, excluding non-IRP links and applications not playing the roles of IRPManager and IRPAgent.

In summary, the security architecture within the OAM&P domain is designed to address specific security objectives and counter identified threats using defined security mechanisms, with a particular emphasis on securing communication links and end-points within the Itf-N component.","The answer should include a detailed description of the security architecture within the OAM&P domain, highlighting the partitioning of security scope into different domains.

"Describe the process and conditions under which xIRI messages are generated and delivered in IMS Signalling Function, particularly focusing on scenarios involving roaming targets and CC unavailability.","The IMS Signalling Function generates and delivers xIRI messages under specific conditions to the MDF2. There are three types of xIRI messages generated:

1. **Encapsulated SIP message xIRI**: This is generated when the IRI-POI in the IMS Signalling Function detects that a SIP message is received from, sent to, or processed on behalf of a target. This message is then delivered to the MDF2.

2. **CC unavailable in serving PLMN xIRI**: This is generated for session scenarios where access to the target media is not available to the CSP. This situation often arises when the target is roaming, and the media does not enter the HPLMN. The HPLMN must perform the interception without the CC and report the CC unavailability to the LEMF, indicating that the target is roaming. If a new warrant is activated on a target with an ongoing IMS session where the CC is not available, the HPLMN must report this unavailability to the LEMF associated with the new warrant.

3. **Start of interception with an established IMS session xIRI**: This is generated when an interception is activated on an established IMS session. To support this, the IMS Signalling Function must store and maintain session-related information, including media information, for the duration of all IMS sessions.

Additionally, the IRI events for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture are the same as the xIRI defined in clause 7.4.3.2. This clause provides detailed information on the generation and delivery of these xIRI messages.","The answer must include the types of xIRI messages generated by the IMS Signalling Function, the specific conditions under which each type is generated, and the process of delivering these messages to MDF2. It should also cover the handling of media interception for roaming targets, including the reporting of CC unavailability to LEMF and the role of HPLMN in this process. Additionally, the answer should reference the IRI events for IMS sessions in VPLMN with LBO as the roaming architecture and connect this to the detailed information provided in clause 7.4.3.2."
Describe the flow control mechanisms for BAP entities in IAB nodes as specified in TS 38.340.,"The flow control mechanisms for BAP entities in IAB nodes, as specified in TS 38.340, involve two main processes: flow control feedback and flow control polling.

Flow control feedback is triggered under two conditions:
1. When the buffer load exceeds a certain level, prompting a flow control feedback.
2. When a BAP Control PDU for flow control polling is received at the receiving part.

Upon triggering, the transmitting part of the BAP entity at the IAB-MT constructs a BAP Control PDU for flow control feedback per BH RLC channel or per BAP routing ID, if configured by RRC, in accordance with clause 6.2.3. The constructed BAP Control PDU is then submitted to the configured egress BH RLC channel of the egress link, indicated by Egress BH RLC CH ID IE in BH Information IE associated with Non-UP Traffic Type IE set to BAP control PDU in TS 38.473. If no specific egress BH RLC channel is configured, the BAP Control PDU is submitted to any egress BH RLC channel of the egress link.

Flow control polling is transmitted over an egress link by the transmitting part of the BAP entity at the IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU. The BAP Control PDU for flow control polling is constructed in accordance with clause 6.2.3. Similar to flow control feedback, if the egress BH RLC channel for the BAP Control PDU is configured as specified in TS 38.473, the PDU is submitted to the configured egress BH RLC channel of the egress link, indicated by BH RLC CH ID IE associated with BAP Control PDU Channel IE set to true. If no specific egress BH RLC channel is configured, the PDU is submitted to any egress BH RLC channel of the egress link.

The RRC configuration plays a crucial role in determining the construction and submission of BAP Control PDUs for both flow control feedback and polling.","The answer must include the conditions under which flow control feedback and polling are triggered, the process for constructing BAP Control PDUs for both feedback and polling, and the submission process to the egress BH RLC channel. It should reference the relevant clauses and specifications (TS 38.340 and TS 38.473) and explain the role of RRC configuration."
"Describe the process and requirements for creating a subscription to monitor network slice events using the Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure API, including immediate reporting of network slice status.","The process for creating a subscription to monitor network slice events using the Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure API involves several steps and specific requirements. The NF Service Consumer (e.g., NEF, AF, or NWDAF) initiates the subscription process by sending a POST request to the NSACF. The request must include the following information in the HTTP message body:
- NF ID: The identity of the network function instance initiating the subscription.
- Notification URI: The address to deliver the event notifications generated by the subscription.
- Notification Correlation ID: A unique correlation identity for the subscription.
- SAC Event Type: Specifies whether to notify the number of UEs registered with a network slice or the number of PDU Sessions established on a network slice.
- Event Filter: Indicates the S-NSSAI(s) in serving PLMN and/or mapped S-NSSAI(s) in home PLMN to be monitored and reported.
- SAC Event Report Triggers: Defines whether the notification is threshold triggered or periodic triggered.
- Notification threshold: If the SAC Event Report Triggers is threshold triggered, defines a numeric value or a percentage of the maximum number of UEs or PDU Sessions per network slice.
- Notification periodicity: If the SAC Event Report Triggers is periodic triggered, defines the time between notifications.

The URI structure for the Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure API is described in Figure 6.2.3.1-1, and the applicable HTTP methods are provided in Table 6.2.3.1-1.

Upon successful creation of the subscription, the NSACF responds with a status code 201 and includes a HTTP Location header to provide the location of the newly created resource. The response may also contain an expiry time, determined by the NSACF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. If the immediateFlag attribute is set to ","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the initial conditions and test configurations for UE testing as specified in TS 37.571, including the trajectory parameters and measurement control messages.","The initial conditions for UE testing as specified in TS 37.571 include several key elements. The test environment is defined as 'Normal' according to TS 38.508-1 clause 4.1. The frequencies and channel bandwidth to be tested are also specified in TS 38.508-1 clause 4.3.1. 

The UE is required to move on a rectangular trajectory of 940 meters by 1,440 meters with rounded corners, as illustrated in Figure 13.1 of TS 37.571. The initial reference point is established, followed by acceleration to a final speed of 100 km/h over 250 meters. The UE maintains this speed for 400 meters, then decelerates to 25 km/h over the next 250 meters. The UE then turns 90 degrees with a turning radius of 20 meters at 25 km/h, followed by acceleration back to 100 km/h over 250 meters. This sequence is repeated to complete the rectangular trajectory.

For GNSS testing, the parameters are set according to Table 13.6.8 or 13.6.9 for GNSS scenario #5 in TS 37.571-5. Test Configuration A involves setting the cell parameters according to TS 38.508-1 clause 4.4.1.2 for non-standalone E-UTRA single cell and NR single cell network scenarios. Test Configuration B involves setting the cell parameters according to TS 38.508-1 clause 4.4.1.1 for standalone NR single cell network scenarios.

The UE is then switched on, and a signaling connection is established according to the generic procedure in TS 38.508-1 clause 4.5.4 (RRC_CONNECTED).

Regarding measurement control messages, UE-based test cases requiring adequate assistance data involve spreading the IE 'UE positioning assistance data' across two separate MEASUREMENT CONTROL messages. The specifics of these messages are detailed in TS 37.571 clauses 4.3.1, 4.4.1.1, and 4.4.1.2. Additionally, references to relevant clauses in 3GPP TS 34.123-3, such as clause 8.7.7 and clause 5, provide further context and guidelines for these procedures.","The answer should include the initial conditions for UE testing, specifying the test environment, frequencies, and channel bandwidth as per TS 38.508-1.

Additionally, the answer should cover the establishment of signaling connection and the specifics of the MEASUREMENT CONTROL messages, including the spread of UE positioning assistance data across two messages. References to relevant clauses in 3GPP TS 34.123-3 should be included for completeness."
How should the NF under test handle client credentials assertion validation failures according to the specified requirements?,"The NF under test should handle client credentials assertion validation failures by following a specific verification process as outlined in the requirements. The verification process involves several key steps:

1. **Validation of JWS Signature**: The NF under test must validate the signature of the JSON Web Signature (JWS) as described in RFC 7515. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the client credentials assertion.

2. **Validation of Timestamp and Expiration Time**: The NF under test must validate the timestamp (iat) and/or the expiration time (exp) as specified in RFC 7519. If the receiving node is the NRF, it validates both the timestamp and the expiration time. If the receiving node is the NF Service Producer, it validates the expiration time and may validate the timestamp.

3. **Audience Claim Check**: The NF under test must check that the audience claim in the client credentials assertion matches its own type. This ensures that the assertion is intended for the correct recipient.

4. **NF Instance ID Verification**: The NF under test must verify that the NF instance ID in the client credentials assertion matches the NF instance ID in the public key certificate used for signing the assertion.

The requirements also specify several test case scenarios to verify the handling of validation failures:

- **Test Case 1: Failed Verification of the Client Credentials Assertion Integrity**: The tester computes a client credentials assertion with an incorrect signature and includes it in the service request. The NF under test should fail the integrity verification and reject the service request, sending back an error message.

- **Test Case 2: Incorrect Audience Claim**: The tester computes a client credentials assertion with an incorrect audience claim and includes it in the service request. The NF under test should verify the mismatch in the audience claim and reject the service request, sending back an error message.

- **Test Case 3: Expired Client Credentials Assertion**: The tester computes an access token with an expired expiration time and includes it in the service request. The NF under test should verify the expired assertion and reject the service request, sending back an error message.

**Pre-Conditions for Testing**:
- A test environment with a consumer NF and a SCP, which may be simulated.
- The NF under test is preconfigured with the certificate of the consumer NF.
- The NF under test is configured to require assertions for NF consumer authentication for at least one of its services.
- The tester has the private key of the consumer NF.
- The tester has access to the interface between the consumer NF and the NF under test.

**Execution Steps**:
- For each test case, the tester computes the client credentials assertion with the specified error (incorrect signature, incorrect audience claim, expired assertion) and includes it in the service request sent from the consumer NF to the NF under test via the SCP.
- The NF under test performs the validation checks and rejects the service request if the validation fails, sending back an error message.

**Expected Format of Evidence**:
- Evidence suitable for the interface, such as a screenshot containing the operational results, should be provided to validate the results of the test cases.

By following these guidelines, the NF under test can ensure proper handling of client credentials assertion validation failures, maintaining the security and integrity of the authentication process.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Description of the verification process for client credentials assertion by NRF or NF Service Producer.
  - Specific validation checks: JWS signature, timestamp (iat), expiration time (exp), audience claim, and NF instance ID.
  - Detailed explanation of test case scenarios for validation failures:
    - Incorrect signature: how the NF under test should handle it.
    - Incorrect audience claim: how the NF under test should handle it.
    - Expired assertion: how the NF under test should handle it.
  - Expected results for each test case scenario: rejection of service request and error message.
  - Pre-conditions and execution steps required for testing.
  - Format of evidence required to validate the results."
"Explain the Trace function and MDT sessions in eNB, including the initiation and configuration of application layer measurements, and how MDT configurations are handled during handover and UE context retrieval.","The Trace function in the eNB plays a crucial role in controlling trace sessions and MDT (Minimization of Drive Tests) sessions. It also manages the Application Layer Measurement Collection, which is essential for gathering application layer measurements from the User Equipment (UE).

The Application Layer Measurement Collection function enables the collection of QoE (Quality of Experience) measurements for streaming services and MTSI (Mobile Telephony Service over IP) services from the UE. This feature is activated by the Trace Function from the MDT framework and can be initiated either through signalling based or management based methods. In the signalling based case, the collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN (Core Network) nodes using the MDT mechanism. For the management based case, the collection is initiated from OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) targeting an area without focusing on a specific UE. The configuration and reporting of application layer measurements are supported only in the RRC_CONNECTED state, and E-UTRAN can release the configuration towards the UE at any time.

MDT measurements collection can be initiated by the RAN (Radio Access Network) in two ways: management based, which does not target a specific UE, and signalling based, which targets a specific UE. Management based MDT initiation involves considerations such as user consent and roaming status, and the CN indicates whether MDT is allowed for the user. Signalling based MDT initiation involves specific trace activation messages from CN nodes.

During handover and UE context retrieval, the handling of MDT configurations depends on the initiation method. Management based MDT configurations do not propagate during handover. For LTE, signalling based MDT configurations for a specific UE will propagate during intra-PLMN handover and may propagate during inter-PLMN handover if the Signalling Based MDT PLMN List includes the target PLMN. For UMTS, signalling based MDT configurations continue during intra-PLMN handover and may continue during inter-PLMN handover, except for SRNS relocation. For NR, signalling based MDT configurations propagate during intra-PLMN handover, intra-PLMN UE context retrieval, and may propagate during inter-PLMN handover or inter-PLMN UE context retrieval if the Signalling Based MDT PLMN List includes the target PLMN. This behaviour also applies to MDT configurations that include area scope, regardless of the source or target cell's inclusion in the configured area scope.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The role of the Trace function in controlling trace and MDT sessions in eNB.
- The initiation and configuration of Application Layer Measurement Collection, including supported service types and initiation methods.
- The procedures for MDT measurements collection initiation, including management based and signalling based cases.
- How MDT configurations are handled during handover and UE context retrieval, including propagation rules for different types of handovers and PLMN lists."
"Describe the syntax and expected values for the +CSQ action command in 3GPP TS 27.007, including the mapping of RXQUAL values to BER as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.","The +CSQ action command in 3GPP TS 27.007 is used to return the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel bit error rate (BER) from the mobile terminal (MT).

"Describe the procedures and requirements for UE when performing an inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, including handling of specific IEs such as 'NONCE' and 'rSR-VCC Info'.","When performing an inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, the UE must follow specific procedures and requirements as outlined in the provided documents. The UE should be capable of receiving a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message and executing the handover even if no prior measurements have been performed on the target cell.

For FDD, if the UE has a pending 'TGPS reconfiguration CFN' at the activation time received in the HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND, it may abort the pending CM activation and set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to TRUE. Otherwise, it should set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to FALSE.

If the IE 'NONCE' is present in the IE 'SR-VCC Info', the UE must perform security configurations according to subclause 8.6.3.15. If the IE 'rSR-VCC Info' is included, the UE should act as specified in subclause 8.6.3.16.

The UE must establish the connection to the target radio access technology using the contents of the IE 'Inter-RAT message', which includes information about the candidate/target cell identifiers and relevant radio parameters. If the IE 'RAB info to replace' is present, the UE should indicate to the upper layers that the radio access bearer identified by this IE is released as part of an SR-VCC procedure.

For the IE 'System type' with values 'GSM' or 'GERAN Iu', the UE should set the BAND_INDICATOR based on the 'Frequency band' value and apply the 'Inter RAT Message' according to the specified standard. If the IE 'RAB information List' is included, the UE should connect upper layer entities corresponding to the indicated CS or PS domain RAB to the radio resources indicated in the inter-RAT message.

Regarding the handling of 'rSR-VCC Info', if it contains the IE 'IMS information', the UE must indicate this IE to the upper layers as part of the rSR-VCC procedure. If 'rSR-VCC Info' contains the IE 'NONCE', the UE should forward it to the upper layers as specified.

The presence of the IE 'NONCE' in the IE 'SR-VCC Info' triggers actions for mapping keys from the PS domain to the CS domain. The UE must set the 'Status' in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS of the CS domain to 'Started', calculate the CK and IK for the CS domain, and update the signalling connections accordingly.

In summary, the UE must follow detailed procedures for handling specific IEs during an inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, ensuring proper security configurations, ciphering status updates, and forwarding necessary information to upper layers.","The answer should cover the following key details:
- The UE's ability to perform inter-RAT handover without prior measurements on the target cell.

Explain the key elements and mechanisms involved in the control and monitoring of GPRS sessions and PDP contexts as described in 3GPP TS 23.078.,"The control and monitoring of GPRS sessions and PDP contexts in 3GPP TS 23.078 involve several key elements and mechanisms:

1. **Types of Detection Points (DPs)**:
   - **Trigger Detection Point-Request (TDP-R)**: This DP is statically armed and may initiate a CAMEL control relationship within a new GPRS dialogue. When the GPRS event is encountered and reported, processing is suspended.
   - **Event Detection Point-Request (EDP-R)**: This DP is dynamically armed within the context of a CAMEL control relationship. When the GPRS event is encountered and reported, processing is suspended, and the gprsSSF waits for instructions from the gsmSCF.
   - **Event Detection Point-Notification (EDP-N)**: This DP is dynamically armed within the context of a CAMEL control relationship. When the GPRS event is encountered and reported, processing is not suspended.

2. **Arming and Disarming Mechanisms for DPs**:
   - **Static Arming**: DPs for GPRS Session and PDP Context are statically armed as a result of the GPRS-CSI analysis in the SGSN.
   - **Dynamic Arming**: DPs may be dynamically armed by the gsmSCF within the context of a CAMEL control relationship. PDP context-related DPs may be armed as generic or non-generic DPs.
   - **Disarming Rules**: Statically armed DPs are disarmed when the GPRS-CSI is withdrawn in the HLR. EDPs related to the GPRS Session are disarmed if the session is released. Non-generically armed EDPs related to a PDP context are disarmed if the context is released or if a non-generically armed EDP is met.

3. **Scenario 1 for CAMEL Control**:
   - **Structure of GPRS Dialogues**: Scenario 1 allows CAMEL control of the GPRS session and multiple PDP contexts within a single GPRS dialogue. A GPRS dialogue consists of one GPRS Attach/Detach State Model and optionally multiple GPRS PDP Context State Models.
   - **Relationship Between State Models**: The GPRS dialogue and the relationship between the GPRS Attach/Detach State Model and the gsmSCF are initiated using the TDPs of the Attach/Detach State Model. The gsmSCF requests further control or monitoring of individual PDP contexts using the Request Report GPRS Event information flow.

4. **Implicit Disarming Rules for EDPs**:
   - **Conditions for Disarming**: Implicit EDP disarming occurs when an EDP is encountered, irrespective of its MonitorMode. EDPs armed generically for GPRS PDP Context State Models are implicitly disarmed at the end of the GPRS dialogue.
   - **Rearming**: It is possible to rearm explicitly an implicitly disarmed DP.

5. **GPRS PDP Context State Model and Attach/Detach State Model**:
   - **Suspension of Processing at DPs**: When encountering a DP, the processing in the PDP Context State Model or Attach/Detach State Model is suspended at the DP. The SGSN indicates this to the gprsSSF, which determines the action to be taken if the DP is armed.
   - **Role of SGSN and gprsSSF**: The SGSN handles the suspension of processing at DPs, while the gprsSSF determines the subsequent actions based on the armed DPs.

These elements and mechanisms ensure effective control and monitoring of GPRS sessions and PDP contexts, allowing for dynamic and flexible management of mobile data services.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - Description of the different types of Detection Points (TDP-R, EDP-R, EDP-N) and their roles.

Describe the process and API operations involved in subscribing to and receiving notifications for updated user profile data in the VAL system.,"The process of subscribing to and receiving notifications for updated user profile data in the VAL system involves several steps and specific API operations as outlined in the 3GPP TS 23.434.

1. **Subscription Request Process**:
   - The VAL server or configuration management client initiates an updated user profile subscription request to the configuration management server. This request is aimed at subscribing to updates for the user profiles of one or more VAL users or VAL UEs (User Equipment).
   - The configuration management server checks if the requesting entity (VAL server or configuration management client) is authorized to initiate the subscription request.
   - Upon successful authorization, the configuration management server responds with an updated user profile subscription response, indicating the status of the subscription.

2. **Notification Process**:
   - Once subscribed, the configuration management server sends notifications to the VAL server or configuration management client whenever there are changes to the user profiles of the subscribed VAL users or VAL UEs.
   - These notifications include detailed information about the changes in the user profiles.

3. **API Operations**:
   - **Subscribe_User_Profile_Update**:

Describe the range and application of spreading factors for various uplink physical channels.,"The range of spreading factors for uplink physical channels spans from SF = 16 down to SF = 1. For each physical channel, an individual minimum spreading factor (SFmin) is transmitted by higher layers. There are two options indicated by UTRAN for UE usage of spreading factors: 1) The UE shall use the spreading factor SFmin, independent of the current Transport Format Combination (TFC), or 2) The UE shall autonomously increase the spreading factor depending on the current TFC. If the UE autonomously changes the SF, it must vary the channelisation code along the branch with the higher code numbering of the allowed Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) sub-tree. In cases where code hopping is configured by higher layers, the allowed OVSF sub-tree is determined by the effective allocated OVSF code after the hop sequence has been applied.

For multicode transmission, a UE can use a maximum of two physical channels per timeslot simultaneously, and these channels must be transmitted using different channelisation codes.

Specifically, for the uplink Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH), the spreading factors used are either SF = 16 or SF = 8. The set of admissible spreading codes for PRACH and the associated spreading factors are broadcast on the Broadcast Channel (BCH) within the RACH configuration parameters.

For the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), the applicable spreading factors are SF = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Similarly, the Enhanced Physical Uplink Channel (E-PUCH) also uses spreading factors SF = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.","The answer should include the range of spreading factors (SF = 16 to 1) for uplink physical channels, the specific spreading factors for PRACH (SF = 16 or SF = 8), PUSCH (SF = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), and E-PUCH (SF = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16). It should also cover the options for UE usage of spreading factors, the autonomous changes by UE, code hopping configuration, and multicode transmission details."

1. **TCP-based Media Protection**:
   - The protection relies on the usage of TLS according to the TLS profiles specified in Annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 and Annex M of 3GPP TS 33.328.
   - The end-to-end security for session-based messaging (MSRP) and conferencing (BFCP) is based on pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS (specified in IETF RFC 4279) and the MIKEY-TICKET mechanism (specified in IETF RFC 6043).
   - The Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is the Traffic-Encrypting Key (TEK) associated with the Crypto Session (CS) used in the TLS handshake.
   - The MRFC (Media Resource Function Controller) and MRFP (Media Resource Function Processor) have specific roles in session initiation and response, including preparing media security offers, checking authorization, and deriving PSKs.

"Describe the methods and requirements for measuring UE delays in both sending and receiving directions for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR, or WLAN access as specified in 3GPP TS 26.132.","The methods and requirements for measuring UE delays in both sending and receiving directions for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR, or WLAN access are detailed in 3GPP TS 26.132. The sum of the UE delays in the sending and receiving directions (TS+TR) should be measured under error and jitter free conditions according to the methods described in clauses 7.10.1 and 7.10.2. If the test equipment delays are unstable or cannot be accurately determined, an alternative method described in clause 7.10.3 may be used, and any instability or inaccuracy observed should be recorded in the test report. Additionally, the test method(s) used and all results obtained must be documented in the test report.

For conditions with simulated packet arrival time variations, the sum of the UE delays (TS+TR-jitter) and the objective speech quality in the receive direction should be measured according to the method described in clause 7.10.4. Prior to actual measurements, the clock skew between the UE and the reference client must be compensated by adjusting the clock of the reference client to match the clock of the UE, with an inaccuracy of less than 1ppm measured according to the procedure in Annex D. It is essential to ensure that packet generation by the reference client and packet treatment of the test equipment are free of jitter.

The detailed procedure for obtaining UE delay includes measuring the delay between the MRP and the DRP and subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured value.

What are the performance criteria for NR repeaters and ancillary equipment as specified in TS 38.114?,"The performance criteria for NR repeaters and ancillary equipment as specified in TS 38.114 are as follows:

For NR repeaters, the performance criteria outlined in clause 6.2 apply. This includes specific power accuracy requirements for different types of repeaters. For repeater type 1-C, the measured output power Pmax,p,AC after each exposure and after the total test must not change from the rated passband output power Prated,p,AC measured before the test by more than ±2 dB.

"Describe the AKMA feature in the 5G system, including its architecture, procedures, and related standards.","Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) is a cellular-network-based delegated authentication system designed for the 5G system. It facilitates the establishment of a secure tunnel between the end user and the application server, allowing users to log in to application services using their 3GPP credential, which is the permanent key stored in the user's tamper-resistant smart card UICC. The application service provider can delegate the task of user authentication to the mobile network operator through AKMA.

The AKMA architecture introduces a new Network Function into the 5G system known as the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF). The detailed services and API definitions for AAnF are specified in TS 29.535. The procedures and principles of AKMA are outlined in TS 33.535, with the general principles derived from the related study documented in TR 33.835.

AKMA is considered a successor to earlier standards such as the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) and Battery-efficient Security for very low throughput machine type communication devices (BEST), both specified by SA3. Unlike these earlier systems, the development of AKMA did not involve stage 1, as it was directly launched by SA3.

In summary, AKMA enhances the security and efficiency of user authentication in the 5G system by leveraging 3GPP credentials and introducing the AKMA Anchor Function, with its architecture and procedures detailed in TS 33.535, TR 33.835, and TS 29.535.","The answer should cover the purpose of AKMA in the 5G system, its architecture including the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF), and the procedures for authentication and key management. It should reference the relevant standards (TS 33.535, TR 33.835, TS 29.535) and explain how AKMA builds upon earlier standards like GBA and BEST."
Describe the procedures and key elements involved in the ProseKey and Retrieve service operations for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay communication over User Plane.,"The ProseKey and Retrieve service operations are essential for establishing PC5 security for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay communication over the User Plane.

The ProseKey service operation is invoked by a Network Function (NF) Service Consumer, such as another PKMF in a different PLMN, to retrieve keying material related to 5G ProSe. This operation is used during the PC5 security establishment procedure. The NF Service Consumer sends an HTTP POST request to invoke the 'request' custom method on the resource URI of the 'Prose Keys Collection' resource. The request payload must be an object of 'ProseKeyReqData' data type, including the Relay Service Code, the KNRP freshness parameter 1, and either the SUCI of the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the UP-PRUK ID.

Upon success, the PKMF responds with a status code '200 OK', and the response payload is an object of 'ProseKeyRspData' data type, including the KNRP, the KNRP freshness parameter 2, and optionally the GPI. If the request fails or requires redirection, the PKMF returns one of the HTTP status codes listed in the relevant table, and for 4xx/5xx responses, the message body contains a ProblemDetails structure with the 'cause' attribute set to one of the application errors.

If synchronization fails when the UE processes the authentication challenge in the GPI, and a subsequent Key Request is sent for resynchronization, the NF Service Consumer sends another HTTP POST request with a payload including the Relay Service Code, the KNRP freshness parameter 1, and the information for resynchronization (RAND and AUTS). The PKMF responds similarly with either a '200 OK' status and the required keying material or an appropriate error status and message.

The Retrieve service operation is used by the NF Service Consumer, such as SMF or PKMF, to request the PKMF to get the SUPI of a 5G ProSe Remote UE. The NF Service Consumer sends a POST request to the resource representing the resolve-id custom operation, with the request body containing the UP-PRUK ID. On success, the PKMF responds with '200 OK' and the message body containing the corresponding SUPI. If there is no valid data, a '404 Not Found' status is returned with additional error information in the response body. For other failures, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error is returned along with additional error information in the POST response body.

These operations ensure secure communication and proper identification of UEs in the 5G ProSe network.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The purpose and usage of the ProseKey service operation, including the specific procedure it supports.
  - Detailed steps for invoking the ProseKey service operation, including the required payloads and expected responses.
  - Handling of success and failure scenarios, including specific HTTP status codes and error information.
  - Conditional resynchronization steps for the ProseKey service operation.
  - The purpose and usage of the Retrieve service operation, including the specific procedure it supports.
  - Detailed steps for invoking the Retrieve service operation, including the required payloads and expected responses.
  - Handling of success and failure scenarios, including specific HTTP status codes and error information."
What are the spectrum emission mask requirements for base stations operating in multiple bands according to 3GPP TS 25.105 and TS 25.142?,"The spectrum emission mask requirements for base stations (BS) operating in multiple bands according to 3GPP TS 25.105 and TS 25.142 are detailed as follows:

1. **Definitions of Key Parameters**:
   - **f**: The separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
   - **f_offset**: The separation between the carrier frequency and the center frequency of the measuring filter.
   - **f_offsetmax**: Either 4 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge (or operating band edge) as defined, whichever is greater.
   - **f_max**: Equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measurement filter.

2. **Single RF Carrier Requirements**:
   - For regions where the specific clauses apply, the BS must transmit on a single RF carrier configured according to the manufacturer’s specification.
   - Emissions must not exceed the maximum levels specified in the relevant tables (Tables 6.3A to 6.5A in TS 25.105 and Tables 6.13A to 6.16A in TS 25.142) for the appropriate BS maximum output power.

3. **Multi-Band Operation**:
   - For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, single-band requirements apply, and cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the inter-RF bandwidth gap is not applicable.
   - Inside any inter RF bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 8 MHz, emissions must not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum requirements specified at the RF bandwidth edges on each side of the inter RF bandwidth gap.

4. **Measurement Procedures**:
   - Measure the power of the BS spectrum emissions using Gaussian filters with bandwidths specified in the relevant tables.
   - The center frequency of the filter should be stepped in contiguous steps over the ranges of frequency offsets f_offset as given in the tables, with the step width equal to the respective measurement bandwidth.
   - For multi-band capable BS, repeat the measurement steps per involved band with no carrier activated in the other band, and terminate the antenna connector not being tested.

5. **Specific Spectrum Emission Mask Values**:
   - **TS 25.105**:
     - Table 6.3A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power P ≥ 34 dBm.
     - Table 6.4A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power 26 ≤ P < 34 dBm.
     - Table 6.5A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power P < 26 dBm.
   - **TS 25.142**:
     - Table 6.13A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power P ≥ 34 dBm for 1.28 Mcps TDD.
     - Table 6.14A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power 26 ≤ P < 34 dBm for 1.28 Mcps TDD.
     - Table 6.16A: Spectrum emission mask values for BS maximum output power P < 26 dBm for 1.28 Mcps TDD.
     - Table 6.18A to 6.21A: Test requirements for spectrum emission mask values.

These requirements ensure that the BS emissions are within specified limits to minimize interference and maintain signal integrity across different regions and operational bands.","The answer must include the definitions of key parameters (f, f_offset, f_offsetmax, f_max), the specific spectrum emission mask values for different BS maximum output powers, the measurement procedures for spectrum emissions, and the applicability of single-band requirements for multi-band base stations. It should also reference the relevant tables from the documents for specific values."
Describe the requirements for TDD RSRP relative measurements and reference sensitivity power levels as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.101.,"The requirements for TDD RSRP relative measurements and reference sensitivity power levels are defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and TS 36.101. 

For TDD RSRP relative measurements, the relative accuracy requirements must meet the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.4. These requirements are valid under the following conditions:
1. Cell specific reference signals are transmitted from one, two, or four antenna ports.
2. Conditions defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
3. RSRP measurements are performed according to clause I.3.1 for the corresponding band.
4. The time domain measurement resource restriction pattern configured for the measured cell indicates at least one subframe per radio frame for performing the RSRP measurement.
5. Four symbols containing CRS are available in all subframes indicated by the time domain measurement resource restriction pattern.

The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.2.4, clause 9.1.4, and A.9.1.11.

Regarding reference sensitivity power levels, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3, the reference sensitivity power level (REFSENS) is the minimum mean power applied to each UE antenna port for all UE categories except category 0, category M1, category M2, and category 1bis. For these exceptions, the power is applied to the single antenna port. The throughput must meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel at this power level. The throughput for the REFSENS test is measured based on Transmission Mode 1 unless specified otherwise.","The answer must include the conditions under which the TDD RSRP relative measurements are valid, the specific requirements for relative accuracy, the role of cell specific reference signals, and the reference sensitivity conditions. It should also cover the minimum mean power requirements for different UE categories, the throughput requirements for the REFSENS test, and the use of Transmission Mode 1 for measuring throughput."
"Explain the differences between unacknowledged and acknowledged operations in the context of 3GPP TS 44.005, and describe their applicability to different control channels.","In the context of 3GPP TS 44.005, unacknowledged and acknowledged operations are two distinct modes of data link layer communication.

Unacknowledged operation involves the transmission of layer 3 information using Unnumbered Information (UI) frames. These frames are not acknowledged by the receiving data link layer, meaning there are no mechanisms for flow control or error recovery. This mode is simpler but less reliable, as it does not guarantee the delivery of data. The applicability of unacknowledged operation to different types of control channels is specified in subclause 6.1.

Acknowledged operation, on the other hand, involves the transmission of layer 3 information in frames that are acknowledged by the receiving data link layer. This mode includes error recovery procedures based on the retransmission of unacknowledged frames and defined flow control procedures. If errors cannot be corrected by the data link layer, a report is issued to the layer 3 entity. Acknowledged operation supports multiple frame operation, where layer 3 information is sent in numbered Information (I) frames. Multiple frame operation is initiated by a multiple frame establishment procedure using a Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM) command. The applicability of acknowledged operation to different types of control channels is also specified in subclause 6.1.

Specifically, on Dedicated Control Channels (DCCHs), both unacknowledged operation and multiple frame operation are possible. The type of operation required at any time is determined by layer 3, as outlined in subclause 6.1.

In summary, unacknowledged operation is characterized by the use of UI frames without acknowledgments, flow control, or error recovery, while acknowledged operation involves acknowledged frames, error recovery, flow control, and multiple frame operation. The applicability of these operations to different control channels is detailed in subclause 6.1, with DCCHs supporting both modes as determined by layer 3.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - Definition and characteristics of unacknowledged operation, including the use of UI frames and lack of flow control and error recovery mechanisms.
  - Definition and characteristics of acknowledged operation, including the use of acknowledged frames, error recovery procedures, flow control, and multiple frame operation.
  - The role of subclause 6.1 in specifying the applicability of these operations to different control channels.
  - The specific mention of DCCHs supporting both unacknowledged and multiple frame operations, with the type of operation determined by layer 3."
"Describe the process and requirements for selecting AS algorithms in a 3GPP network, including the roles of the UE, eNB, and MME.","The process and requirements for selecting AS algorithms in a 3GPP network involve several key steps and entities, including the UE (User Equipment), eNB (evolved Node B), and MME (Mobility Management Entity).

1. **Criteria for Algorithm Selection**: The serving network selects algorithms based on two main criteria:
   - The UE security capabilities, which are the security features supported by the UE.
   - The configured allowed list of security capabilities of the currently serving network entity, which is the eNB.

2. **Configuration of eNB**: Each eNB is configured via network management with lists of algorithms that are allowed for usage. There are separate lists for integrity algorithms and ciphering algorithms, and these lists are ordered according to a priority decided by the operator.

3. **Selection Process**: When the AS security context is established in the eNB, the MME sends the UE EPS security capabilities to the eNB. The eNB then selects the ciphering and integrity algorithms with the highest priority from its configured list that are also present in the UE EPS security capabilities.

4. **Agreement on Algorithms**: An active UE and the serving network must agree upon algorithms for:
   - RRC (Radio Resource Control) ciphering and integrity protection.
   - UP (User Plane) ciphering and integrity protection.
   - NAS (Non-Access Stratum) ciphering and integrity protection.

5. **Separate Security Mode Command Procedures**: Separate AS (Access Stratum) and NAS level security mode command procedures are required. The AS level security mode command procedure configures AS security (RRC and UP), while the NAS level security mode command procedure configures NAS security.

6. **Activation of Integrity Protection and Ciphering**: Both integrity protection and ciphering for RRC are activated within the same AS SMC (Security Mode Command) procedure, but not necessarily within the same message. User plane ciphering is activated at the same time as RRC ciphering.

7. **Indication to UE**: The chosen algorithms are indicated to the UE in the AS SMC message. This ensures that the UE is aware of the selected algorithms and can verify that the selection was not manipulated.

In summary, the selection of AS algorithms in a 3GPP network is a coordinated process involving the UE, eNB, and MME, with specific criteria and procedures to ensure secure and efficient communication.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
1. The criteria for algorithm selection by the serving network, including UE security capabilities and the configured allowed list of the serving network entity.
2. The configuration of eNB with lists of algorithms for integrity and ciphering, ordered by priority.
3. The process of the eNB selecting the highest priority algorithm from its list that is also present in the UE EPS security capabilities.
4. The agreement between UE and serving network on algorithms for RRC, UP, and NAS ciphering and integrity protection.
5. The requirement for separate AS and NAS level security mode command procedures.
6. The activation of integrity protection and ciphering for RRC and UP within the AS SMC procedure.
7. The indication of chosen algorithms to the UE in the AS SMC."

What are the key uplink and downlink parameters for DPCH and PDSCH as specified in TS 25.993 Release '99?,"The key uplink and downlink parameters for DPCH and PDSCH as specified in TS 25.993 Release '99 are as follows:

For DPCH:

Describe the parity and convolutional encoding process for the RATSCCH message as specified in the 3GPP TS 45.003 document.,"The parity and convolutional encoding process for the RATSCCH message in the 3GPP TS 45.003 document involves several steps. Firstly, a 14-bit CRC is used for error detection, where the 14 parity bits are generated by the cyclic generator polynomial g(D) = D14 + D13 + D5 + D3 + D2 + 1 from the 35 comfort noise parameter bits. The encoding of the cyclic code is performed in a systematic form, resulting in the polynomial d(0)D(48) + d(1)D(47) +... + d(34)D(14) + p(0)D(13) +…+ p(12)D + p(13), where p(0), p(1) … p(13) are the parity bits. When divided by g(D), this yields a remainder equal to 1 + D + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6 + D7 + D8 + D9 + D10 + D11 + D12 + D13. The information and parity bits are then merged, with u(k) = d(k) for k = 0, 1, …, 34 and u(k) = p(k-35) for k = 35, 36, …, 48.

Next, the comfort noise parameters with parity and tail bits (u(0..48)) are encoded using a ¼ rate convolutional code defined by the polynomials G1/G3 = 1 + D + D3 + D4 / 1 + D + D2 + D3 + D4, G2/G3 = 1 + D2 + D4 / 1 + D + D2 + D3 + D4, and G3/G3 = 1. This results in 212 coded bits, {C(0)… C(211)}, defined by the equations r(k) = u(k) + r(k-1) + r(k-2) + r(k-3) + r(k-4), C(4k) = r(k) + r(k-1) + r(k-3) + r(k-4), C(4k+1) = r(k) + r(k-2) + r(k-4), C(4k+2) = u(k), and C(4k+3) = u(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 48; r(k) = 0 for k < 0. For termination of the coder, r(k) = 0, C(4k) = r(k) + r(k-1) + r(k-3) + r(k-4), C(4k+1) = r(k) + r(k-2) + r(k-4), C(4k+2) = r(k-1) + r(k-2) + r(k-3) + r(k-4), and C(4k+3) = r(k-1) + r(k-2) + r(k-3) + r(k-4) for k = 49, 50, ..., 52. This block of data is then moved to the coded data (c) as c(k+16) = C(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., 211.

The parity and convolutional encoding for the RATSCCH message are done as specified for the RATSCCH_DATA frame at half rate in subclause 3.10.9.2 and as specified for the RATSCCH_DATA frame in O-TCH/AHS in subclause 3.15.9.2.","The answer should include the process of generating parity bits using a 14-bit CRC and the cyclic generator polynomial, the systematic form encoding, and the merging of information and parity bits. It should also cover the convolutional encoding process using the ¼ rate convolutional code, the polynomials involved, and the resulting 212 coded bits. Additionally, it should mention the references to the RATSCCH message encoding as specified in subclauses 3.10.9.2 and 3.15.9.2."
"Explain the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure as defined in TS 36.465, including the key parameters involved and their significance.","The Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure, as defined in TS 36.465, is designed to provide feedback from the Wireless Termination (WT) to the eNodeB (eNB) to help control the downlink user data flow via the WT for the respective E-RAB in the LWA option or for the respective UE in the LWIP option. The WT may also transfer uplink user data for the concerned E-RAB to the eNB along with a DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame within the same GTP-U PDU.

When the WT decides to trigger the Feedback for Downlink Data Delivery procedure, it reports several key elements:
a) The highest Xw-U sequence number successfully transferred towards or delivered to the UE among those PDUs received from the eNB.
b) The desired buffer size in bytes for the concerned E-RAB in the LWA option or for the concerned UE in the LWIP option.
c) The minimum desired buffer size in bytes for the UE.
d) The Xw-U packets that were declared as being 'lost' by the WT and have not yet been reported to the eNB within the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame.

Additionally, the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame includes an indication of whether the frame is the last DL status report received during the release of a bearer from the WT. This indication helps the eNB determine that no more uplink data is expected from the WT.

Upon receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame, the eNB:
- Regards the desired buffer size as the amount of data desired from the WT.
- Considers the highest Xw-U sequence number reported within the same frame and the most recently reported Xw-U sequence numbers of all other E-RABs established for the UE.
- Treats the momentary desired buffer sizes independently of past indications.
- May remove buffered PDCP or LWIP PDUs based on feedback of successfully delivered PDCP or LWIP PDUs.
- Decides on actions necessary for PDCP or LWIP PDUs reported as other than successfully delivered.

The desired buffer size parameter for the LWA and LWIP options is specified with a value range of {0..232-1} and a field length of 4 octets. Similarly, the minimum desired buffer size parameter for the LWA and LWIP options also has a value range of {0..232-1} and a field length of 4 octets.

In summary, the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure is crucial for managing the flow of downlink user data and ensuring efficient communication between the WT and eNB, with specific parameters providing detailed feedback on data delivery status and buffer requirements.","The answer should cover the purpose of the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure, the specific elements reported by the WT (highest Xw-U sequence number, desired buffer size, minimum desired buffer size, lost Xw-U packets), the significance of the 'last DL status report' indication, and the actions taken by the eNB upon receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame. Additionally, it should explain the desired buffer size and minimum desired buffer size parameters, including their value ranges and field lengths."
"Describe the structure and rules for constructing X2AP messages as defined in TS 36.423, including the tabular format and ASN.1 definitions.","The structure and rules for constructing X2AP messages are detailed in TS 36.423, specifically in sub clauses 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3. 

Sub clauses 9.1 and 9.2 provide a tabular format for describing the messages and information elements required for the X2AP protocol. The attributes used in this tabular format include Presence, Range Criticality, and Assigned Criticality. These attributes are defined and used as per TS 36.413. Presence indicates whether an information element (IE) is mandatory, optional, or conditional. Range Criticality and Assigned Criticality provide information on the importance and handling of the IEs.

Sub clause 9.3 presents the ASN.1 definition for the X2AP protocol, conforming to ITU-T Rec. X.680 and ITU-T Rec. X.681. The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of X2AP messages. In case of any contradiction between the ASN.1 definition and the tabular format in sub clauses 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 definition takes precedence, except for the conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format takes precedence.

When constructing X2AP messages according to the ASN.1 definitions, the following rules apply:
- Information elements (IEs) must be ordered in the IE container as they appear in the object set definitions.
- Object set definitions specify the number of times IEs may appear. An IE must appear exactly once if its presence is mandatory, and at most once if its presence is optional or conditional.
- If a tabular format specifies multiplicity for an IE (i.e., an IE list), the corresponding ASN.1 definition separates the list into two parts: an IE container list and list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own and may contain only one kind of list elements.

If an X2AP message is received that does not conform to these construction rules, it is considered an Abstract Syntax Error and must be handled according to the procedures defined for such errors in clause 10 of the standard.","The answer should include the following key details:
- Explanation of the structure of X2AP messages and information elements as described in sub clauses 9.1 and 9.2.
- Attributes used in the tabular format (Presence, Range Criticality, Assigned Criticality) and their definitions.
- Description of the ASN.1 definition for X2AP protocol as presented in sub clause 9.3.

Compare the online charging procedures for IEC and ECUR models in both simple submission and termination scenarios.,"The online charging procedures for IEC and ECUR models in simple submission and termination scenarios involve distinct steps and message exchanges between the SMS node and the Online Charging System (OCS).

9. The OCS responds with a Reserve Units Response message to the SMS node.

In the termination scenario for the IEC model:

2. The SMS node triggers a Debit Units Request message to the OCS.
3. The OCS performs credit processing based on the request.
4. The OCS responds with a Debit Units Response message to the SMS node.

7. The SMS node triggers a Reserve Units Request [Terminate] message to the OCS reporting the successful event transaction.
8. The OCS performs credit processing based on the request.
9. The OCS responds with a Reserve Units Response message to the SMS node.

A key difference in the termination scenario compared to simple submission is that typically the mobile recipient, rather than the originator, is charged for the short message.

Additionally, the origination of delivery reports uses the same procedures as the simple submission procedures, with the delivery report contained within a new SM.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The steps involved in the online charging process for IEC and ECUR models in simple submission scenarios, including the specific messages exchanged between the SMS node and the OCS.
- The steps involved in the online charging process for IEC and ECUR models in termination scenarios, including the specific messages exchanged between the SMS node and the OCS.

"Describe the procedure for notifying the NF service consumer about AF application AM context events, including the steps involved and the response handling.","The procedure for notifying the NF service consumer about AF application AM context events involves several steps and specific response handling mechanisms. 

Firstly, the PCF (Policy Control Function) is responsible for notifying the NF (Network Function) service consumer when a subscribed AF (Application Function) application AM (Application Management) context event occurs. This is done by invoking the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation. The PCF sends an HTTP POST request to the NF service consumer using the callback URI received during the subscription creation or modification.

The body of the HTTP POST request includes the 'AmEventsNotification' data type, which contains:
- The AM Policy Events Subscription resource identifier related to the notification in the 'appAmContextId' attribute.
- A list of reported events in the 'repEvents' attribute. Each reported event may include additional event information within the 'AmEventNotification' data type.

Upon receiving the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer must acknowledge the request by sending an HTTP response message with the appropriate status code. If the HTTP POST request is accepted, the NF service consumer responds with a '204 No Content' status code, indicating successful receipt of the event notification. If the request is not accepted, the NF service consumer must indicate the cause for rejection in the response, as specified in the relevant clauses.

Additionally, if the NF service consumer determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, it must send an HTTP redirect response as specified in the relevant clause of TS 29.500.

This procedure ensures that the NF service consumer is promptly and accurately informed about AF application AM context events, allowing for appropriate actions to be taken based on the received notifications.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the process and considerations for generating Charging Data Records (CDRs) in a 3GPP network, including the handling of partial records and supplementary services.","In a 3GPP network, the generation of Charging Data Records (CDRs) involves several key processes and considerations to ensure accurate billing and revenue security. The MSC server and Gateway MSC server play crucial roles in collecting and storing all charging relevant information for each mobile station (MS) and PSTN connection. The MSC server, particularly the anchor MSC server, is responsible for charging circuit-switched calls by routing all signaling information through it, even if the traffic channel is routed through another MSC server due to handover. The Gateway MSC server acts as a gateway into other PLMNs or fixed networks and generates CDRs for calls routed from or into other networks.

When CAMEL services are subscribed by the MS, the MSC servers contain CAMEL subscription data that provides the necessary information for invoking CAMEL dialogues to control MS terminating and originating calls. The charging data record parameters resulting from CAMEL treatment are derived from this subscription data. Additionally, specific dialed CAMEL services might influence existing records or trigger the generation of separate records based on service logic.

Partial records are generated to increase the security of the recording process and simplify post-processing. These records are particularly important for connections of extended duration, as the loss of a single CDR could result in significant revenue loss. By generating partial records at regular intervals, the maximum loss of revenue is minimized. Partial records are also used in modern billing systems for cumulative credit-limit checking, preventing subscribers from avoiding credit checks by maintaining long connections without generating CDRs.

Several events can trigger the generation of partial records, including the expiry of the partial record timer, changes in basic service, location, MS classmark, AoC parameters, radio channel type, radio link failure and subsequent call re-establishment, HSCSD parameters, CAMEL destination, and CAMEL CPH operations on call legs. All partial records for the same connection contain the same call reference and are ordered via a running sequence number, with time stamps applying to individual partial records rather than the connection as a whole.

Supplementary service usage is recorded to allow the Billing Domain (BD) to specify the actions to be recorded, such as invocation and registration. Non-call related events, like the administration of supplementary services by the subscriber, result in the production of supplementary service action records. Call-related events, such as the invocation of supplementary services, are recorded in-line in the appropriate CDR and/or in separate SS-action records based on the BD's configuration. When supplementary services result in further connections, such as call forwarding or multi-party service, additional CDRs are produced to describe these connections.

Overall, the generation of CDRs in a 3GPP network involves careful consideration of various factors, including the roles of MSC servers, the impact of CAMEL services, the scenarios leading to partial records, and the recording of supplementary service actions to ensure accurate billing and revenue security.","The answer should cover the roles of MSC server and Gateway MSC server in generating CDRs, the impact of CAMEL services on CDRs, the scenarios leading to the creation of partial records, and the handling of supplementary service actions. It should explain how partial records help in maintaining revenue security and describe the structure and sequence of these records. Additionally, it should detail how supplementary services are recorded and the production of additional CDRs for services like call forwarding and multi-party service."
Describe the procedures and considerations for establishing and using MBMS bearers in MC service group communication sessions as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280.,"The procedures and considerations for establishing and using MBMS bearers in MC service group communication sessions as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 include the following:

1. **Pre-established MBMS Bearers**: These bearers are set up prior to the initiation of the MC service group communication session. The use of pre-established MBMS bearers allows for efficient delivery of media content to multiple users simultaneously, leveraging multicast capabilities to optimize network resources.

2. **Dynamic MBMS Bearer Establishment**: The process for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment involves several steps:
   - Initially, the MC service server uses a unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the downlink (DL) at the start of the group communication session.
   - When the MC service server decides to switch to an MBMS bearer for DL media transmission, it establishes the MBMS bearer using procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468.
   - The MC service server provides MBMS service description information, obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE.
   - The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL media and stops using the unicast bearer for DL media transmission.
   - The MC service client notifies the MC service server of the MBMS listening status and may also report the MBMS reception quality level. Based on this information, the MC service server may decide to switch back to unicast transmission if the MBMS reception quality is insufficient.

3. **Optional Support for ROHC over MBMS**: The support of Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over MBMS is optional for MC service servers and clients. If both header compression and Forward Error Correction (FEC) are applied to a communication over MBMS, the header compression must be performed after the FEC encoding. This ensures that the integrity of the compressed headers is maintained during transmission.

4. **Implementation Specifics and Quality Considerations**: The logic for determining when to establish a new MBMS delivery bearer is implementation-specific. For example, the MC service server might decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UEs participating in the group communication session. Additionally, the MBMS reception quality level reported by the MC service client can be used by the MC service server to make efficient decisions regarding the transmission method, ensuring optimal service quality.

These procedures and considerations ensure that MBMS bearers are effectively utilized in MC service group communication sessions, providing reliable and efficient media delivery to multiple users.","The answer should include the following key details: 
1. Explanation of pre-established MBMS bearers and their use in MC service group communication sessions.

"Describe the error resilience mechanisms available in DIMS, and explain how the counter (CTR) field is used to detect the loss of high-priority DIMS units.","The error resilience mechanisms available in DIMS include Priority, Periodic Random Access Points (RAPs), and Separation of static and dynamic data. 

Priority involves separating essential and non-essential units to determine if a loss needs repair. This mechanism is detailed in subclause 7.3.1, where the counter (CTR) field is used to detect the loss of high-priority DIMS units. Encoders and decoders maintain a running value of the counter, with the encoder placing the current value in each packet. The counter is incremented by one if the packet contains high-priority DIMS units. The decoder compares the CTR field of incoming packets with its running counter to check for high-priority loss. A discontinuity in the sequence number indicates a lost packet, while a discontinuity in the CTR field indicates the number of prioritized packets lost.

Periodic Random Access Points (RAPs) can be placed periodically in a stream, allowing one to tune-in to the channel again in case of error. 

Separation of static and dynamic data can increase the efficiency of Distributed Random Access Points.

The RTP payload header format includes the CTR field, which is used to detect the loss of high-priority units. The header comprises a common format with specific bits designated for various functions, including the CTR field. The CTR field's role in detecting the loss of high-priority units is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data stream.","The answer should cover the following key details:

"Describe the positioning requirements for V2X use cases in 5G systems, including the different service levels and scenarios of network coverage.","The positioning requirements for V2X use cases in 5G systems are detailed in various 3GPP specifications, primarily TS 22.261 and TS 22.186. TS 22.261 specifies high accuracy positioning requirements for the 5G system, summarized in Clause 7.3.2.2, which includes V2X. Seven different positioning service levels are defined in terms of horizontal and vertical accuracy, positioning service availability, and positioning service latency. TS 22.186 outlines relative lateral positioning requirements for general V2X use cases and relative longitudinal positioning requirements for platooning use cases in Clauses 5.1 and 5.2.

The positioning requirements are categorized into three sets based on accuracy and confidence levels:
- Set 1: 10 – 50 meters accuracy with 68 – 95% confidence level, applicable to Group 1 services.
- Set 2: 1 – 3 meters accuracy with 95 – 99% confidence level, applicable to Group 2 services.
- Set 3: 0.1 – 0.5 meters accuracy with 95 – 99% confidence level, applicable to Group 3 services.

Performance metrics for positioning services include vertical accuracy (2 – 3 meters absolute or 0.2 meters relative), positioning service availability (95 – 99.9%), and positioning service latency (10 ms – 1 s). Positioning services should be provided in various environments such as indoor, outdoor, and tunnel areas, and support UE velocities up to 250 km/h.

Three network coverage scenarios are considered for positioning when at least two UEs are involved:
- In-coverage scenario: Both UEs are inside the network.
- Partial coverage scenario: One UE is inside the network while the other is outside.
- Out-of-coverage scenario: Both UEs are outside the network.

These scenarios are relevant for V2X and public safety use cases, which may require positioning even when there is no network or GNSS coverage. The positioning requirements must be fulfilled both inside and outside network coverage, and when GNSS-based positioning is not available or accurate enough.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the high accuracy positioning requirements for 5G systems as specified in TS 22.261 and TS 22.186

"Explain the key specifications related to channel spacing, channel raster, and carrier frequency as defined in 3GPP TS 36.104.","The key specifications related to channel spacing, channel raster, and carrier frequency as defined in 3GPP TS 36.104 are as follows:

1. **Channel Spacing**:
   - The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Nominal Channel spacing} = \frac{\text{BWChannel(1)} + \text{BWChannel(2)}}{2}
     \]
     where BWChannel(1) and BWChannel(2) are the channel bandwidths of the two respective E-UTRA carriers. This spacing can be adjusted to optimize performance in specific deployment scenarios. For 20MHz carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply for both 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz nominal carrier spacing.

2. **Channel Raster**:
   - The channel raster is defined as 100 kHz for all bands. This means that the carrier center frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.

3. **Carrier Frequency and EARFCN**:
   - The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 262143. The relationship between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is given by:
     \[
     FDL = FDL\_low + 0.1(NDL – NOffs-DL)
     \]
     where FDL_low and NOffs-DL are specified values, and NDL is the downlink EARFCN.
   - For the uplink, the relationship is:
     \[
     FUL = FUL\_low + 0.1(NUL – NOffs-UL)
     \]
     where FUL_low and NOffs-UL are specified values, and NUL is the uplink EARFCN.

Describe the authentication and security association procedures between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Generic Access Network Controller (GANC) as specified in 3GPP TS 43.318.,"The authentication and security association procedures between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Generic Access Network Controller (GANC) as specified in 3GPP TS 43.318 involve several key steps and protocols to ensure secure communication.

Firstly, the authentication process is initiated using the IKEv2 protocol. The MS starts the IKEv2 initial exchanges (IKE_SA_INIT), which triggers the EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA authentication procedures. EAP-SIM is used for MS with SIM only or MS with USIM but not capable of UMTS AKA, while EAP-AKA is used for MS with USIM and capable of UMTS AKA. These procedures are performed between the MS and an AAA server, with the GANC-SEGW acting as a relay for the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA messages. Upon successful completion of the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA procedure, the IKEv2 process continues, securing the signalling channel between the MS and GANC-SEGW. This allows the MS and GAN to proceed with discovery or registration.

After authentication, the MS requests an IP address on the network protected by the GANC-SEGW. The MS sets up an IPsec Security Association (SA) with the GANC-SEGW, acting as the initiator in the Traffic Selector negotiation. The protocol ID field in the Traffic Selectors is set to zero, indicating that the protocol ID is not relevant. The IP address range in the TSi is set to the address assigned to the MS, while the IP address range in the TSr is set to 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255. IKEv2 mechanisms are used for NAT detection, NAT traversal, and keep-alive.

All control and user plane data over the Up interface between MS and GANC is sent through the SA. During the setup of the SA, the MS includes a list of supported encryption algorithms, including mandatory and optional algorithms defined in the IPsec profile, and NULL encryption. The GANC-SEGW selects one of these algorithms and signals it to the MS. When NULL encryption is applied, both control and user-plane traffic is sent unencrypted, which can be selected when the connection between the generic IP access network and the GANC is under operator control. Regardless of the encryption configuration, the integrity algorithm ensures that non-ciphered traffic is still integrity protected.","The answer must include details on the authentication methods (EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA) used between the MS and GANC, the role of IKEv2 in establishing secure associations, the process of mutual authentication and key generation, and the steps involved in the secure association establishment. Additionally, it should cover the IP address request procedure, the setup of the IPsec Security Association, the negotiation of Traffic Selectors, NAT detection and traversal mechanisms, the selection and application of encryption algorithms, and the integrity protection of traffic."
Describe the interaction between 5GSM entities and upper layers in the context of URSP and ProSeP.,"The interaction between 5GSM entities and upper layers in the context of URSP and ProSeP involves the exchange of information and requests related to PDU sessions. 

For URSP (User-specific Route Selection Policy), the 5GSM entities in the UE (User Equipment) must indicate various attributes of a newly established PDU session to the upper layers. These attributes include PDU session identity, SSC mode, S-NSSAI, DNN, PDU session type, access type, and PDU address. If a PDU session is released, the 5GSM entity handling the session must inform the upper layers about the identity of the released session. The upper layers can request the 5GSM entity to:
a) Establish a PDU session with specific attributes,
b) Release an existing PDU session, or
c) Establish a PDU session with specific attributes and release an existing PDU session.

For ProSeP (Proximity-based Services Policy), the interaction is similar but involves 5GSM entities in the UE acting as a 5G ProSe layer-3 UE-to-network relay UE. These entities must also indicate the attributes of newly established PDU sessions to the upper layers and inform them about the identity of released sessions. The upper layers can request the 5GSM entity to:
a) Establish a PDU session with specific attributes,
b) Release an existing PDU session, or
c) Establish a PDU session with specific attributes and release an existing PDU session.

In both contexts, the interaction ensures that the upper layers are aware of the status and attributes of PDU sessions, allowing them to manage and optimize network resources effectively.","The answer should cover the following points: 
  - The general concept of interaction between 5GSM entities and upper layers.
  - Specifics of URSP interaction, including the attributes of PDU sessions (PDU session identity, SSC mode, S-NSSAI, DNN, PDU session type, access type, PDU address) and the types of requests upper layers can make (establish, release, or both).

"Explain the GTP-C Overload Control feature as described in TS 23.402 and TS 29.274, including its application, mechanisms, and impact on network nodes.","The GTP-C Overload Control feature is an optional mechanism designed to mitigate overload situations in network nodes using GTP control plane signaling. This feature is supported over the S2a and S2b interfaces via the GTPv2 control plane protocol. It allows nodes to communicate Overload Control Information, which can include details about the node itself or the status of specific APNs.

The PDN Gateway (PDN GW) and the Trusted WLAN Access Network (TWAN)/evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) can send Overload Control Information to each other. For instance, an ePDG may apply certain restrictions towards a PDN GW that has indicated overload, such as rejecting PDN connection requests from the User Equipment (UE) and setting a back-off timer to prevent subsequent requests during the timer's duration. Similarly, a TWAN may reject PDN connection requests from the UE during access authentication and apply a back-off timer to prevent the UE from accessing the SSID.

The Session Management back-off timer plays a crucial role in managing UE behavior. If the UE receives a back-off timer over non-3GPP access from the TWAG, it must refrain from sending any Session Management requests related to that APN via WLAN while the timer is active. This timer does not affect UE behavior in 3GPP access, and vice versa.

Additionally, the PDN GW may apply similar policies towards TWAN/ePDG that have indicated overload, akin to those applied when an MME or SGW indicates overload.

Explain the method of port addressing for routing short messages to multiple applications as described in 3GPP TS 23.040 and TS 29.368.,"The method of port addressing for routing short messages to multiple applications is detailed in 3GPP TS 23.040 and TS 29.368. 

Firstly, the integer representation and transmission order in octets are defined in TS 23.040 clause 9.1.2.1. When bits from multiple octets represent an integer, the byte order is big endian, meaning the octets with the lowest numbers contain the most significant bits. Within an octet, the bits with the highest numbers are the most significant.

For port addressing using an 8-bit addressing space, TS 23.040 clause 9.2.3.24.3 specifies that the total length of the Information Element (IE) is 2 octets. The first octet indicates the destination port (receiving application), and the second octet indicates the originator port (sending application). The port range is up to 255, with values 0-239 reserved and 240-255 available for allocation by applications. If the value of the Information-Element-Data is reserved or not supported, the receiving entity should ignore it.

For port addressing using a 16-bit addressing space, TS 23.040 clause 9.2.3.24.4 specifies that the total length of the IE is 4 octets. The first two octets indicate the destination port, and the last two octets indicate the originator port. The port range is up to 65535, with specific ranges assigned by IANA and 3GPP. Values 0-15999 are assigned by IANA, 16000-16999 are available for SMS applications, 17000-49151 are assigned by IANA, 49152 is a trigger for establishing a PDN connection, and 49153-65535 are reserved for future allocation by 3GPP. Applications must use the same registered value for UDP or TCP transport as assigned by IANA.

Additionally, TS 29.368 clause 6.4.11 references the Application-Port-Identifier AVP (AVP code 3010), which is of type Unsigned32 and is used to uniquely identify the triggering application addressed in the device. This AVP links to TS 23.040 clause 9.2.3.24.4 for further details.

In summary, port addressing for routing short messages involves defining integer representation in octets, using 8-bit and 16-bit addressing spaces with specific port ranges and handling reserved values, and utilizing the Application-Port-Identifier AVP for unique application identification.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The method of integer representation and transmission order in octets as per TS 23.040 clause 9.1.2.1.

"Describe the process and API operation for unsubscribing from a CAPIF event, including the information flow and known consumers.","The process for unsubscribing from a CAPIF event involves several steps and utilizes the 'Unsubscribe_Event' API operation. 

The information flow for the event unsubscription request is detailed in Table 8.8.2.5-1, where the subscribing entity sends an event unsubscription request to the CAPIF core function. The corresponding response flow is described in Table 8.8.2.6-1, where the CAPIF core function sends an event unsubscription response back to the subscribing entity.

The procedure for CAPIF event unsubscription is illustrated in Figure 8.8.5-1 and includes the following steps:
1. The subscribing entity, having already subscribed to CAPIF events, sends an event unsubscription request to the CAPIF core function with the information of the subscribed event.
2. Upon receiving the request, the CAPIF core function checks for the event subscription corresponding to the subscribing entity and verifies if the entity is authorized to unsubscribe from the event.
3. If the subscription information is available and the entity is authorized, the CAPIF core function removes the subscription information.
4. The CAPIF core function then sends an event unsubscription response indicating the successful operation.

The 'Unsubscribe_Event' API operation is described in multiple subclauses:
- Subclause 10.2.5: Known consumers are API invokers.
- Subclause 10.3.8: Known consumers are API publishing functions.
- Subclause 10.4.4: Known consumers include API invokers, API publishing functions, API management functions, and API exposing functions.
- Subclause 10.5.6 and 10.7.4: Known consumers are API management functions.

The inputs for this API operation are detailed in subclause 8.8.2.5, and the outputs are detailed in subclause 8.8.2.6. For a comprehensive understanding of the usage of this API operation, one should refer to subclause 8.8.5.","The answer should include a detailed description of the event unsubscription process, referencing the information flow for both the request and response.

"Describe the process and requirements for an API invoker to onboard itself as a recognized user of the CAPIF core function, including the steps taken by the CAPIF core function to authorize and notify the API invoker.","To onboard itself as a recognized user of the CAPIF core function, the API invoker must send an HTTP POST message to the CAPIF core function. The body of this message should include the API invoker Enrolment Details, an API List, and a Notification Destination URI for onboarding notifications.

Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the CAPIF core function will attempt to determine the authorization of the request. If the CAPIF core function can automatically authorize the request, it will process the API invoker Enrolment Details and the API List, and create the API invoker Profile, which includes the API invoker Identifier, Authentication Information, Authorization Information, and CAPIF Identity Information. It will also verify the API List and create a list of APIs the API invoker is allowed to access, and generate a new resource as defined in the relevant clause. The CAPIF core function will then return the API invoker Profile, the API List, and the CAPIF Resource URI in the response message.

If the CAPIF core function cannot automatically authorize the request, it will acknowledge receipt of the onboarding request and request validation from the CAPIF administrator or API management. Upon successful validation, the CAPIF core function will create the API invoker Profile, generate the new resource, and deliver the API invoker Profile, API List, and CAPIF Resource URI to the API invoker in a notification.

The structure of Resource URIs and the resources and methods used for the service are detailed in the relevant clause, including the supported URI query parameters, request data structures, response data structures, and response codes for the POST method.

If the CAPIF core function cannot immediately authorize the API invoker, it will send a response acknowledging the request and begin processing it. After completion, the CAPIF core function will send an HTTP POST message using the Notification Destination URI provided in the onboarding request. This message will include the API invoker Profile, API List, and CAPIF Resource URI. The API invoker must then process this message and respond with an acknowledgement.

Describe the procedures and criteria for Radio Link Failure (RLF) detection and recovery in different scenarios as outlined in the 3GPP TS 38.300 documents.,"The procedures and criteria for Radio Link Failure (RLF) detection and recovery in different scenarios are detailed in the 3GPP TS 38.300 documents. 

For the IAB-node using SA-mode, RLF on the backhaul link can be declared, and recovery can be performed at another parent node either under the same or a different IAB-donor-CU. In such cases, the collocated IAB-DU and the IAB-DU(s) of its descendant node(s) may retain F1 connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU, while the IAB-MT(s) of the descendant node(s) and all served UEs retain RRC connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU. The BH RLF recovery procedure for the IAB-node is captured in TS 38.401, and BH RLF declaration and recovery aspects are handled in clause 9.2.7 of TS 38.300.

For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, RLF is declared based on several criteria, including the expiry of radio problem timers, random access procedure failure, RLC failure, consistent uplink LBT failures, and reception of a BH RLF indication from a parent node. After RLF is declared, the UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED and takes specific actions depending on the scenario, such as stopping data transmission or reception, releasing the source link, selecting a suitable cell, and initiating RRC re-establishment or entering RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell is not found.

When RLF occurs at the IAB BH link, the same mechanisms and procedures are applied as for the access link, including BH RLF detection and recovery. The IAB-DU can transmit a BH RLF detection indication to its child nodes in certain cases, such as when the collocated IAB-MT initiates RRC re-establishment or detects BH RLF on a BH link and cannot perform UL re-routing. Upon reception of the BH RLF detection indication, the child node may perform local rerouting for upstream traffic if possible. If the IAB-DU transmits a BH RLF recovery indication to a child node, the child node reverts the actions triggered by the previous BH RLF detection indication.

For the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED, Uu RLM is suspended when connected to the gNB via an L2 U2N Relay UE. The L2 U2N Relay UE declares Uu RLF following the same criteria as described in clause 9.2.7. After Uu RLF is declared, the L2 U2N Relay UE can send a PC5-RRC message to its connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s), which may trigger RRC connection re-establishment or indicate to the upper layer to trigger PC5 unicast link release. Upon detecting PC5 RLF, the L2 U2N Remote UE may trigger RRC connection re-establishment.","The answer must include the criteria for RLF declaration by both UE and IAB-node, the procedures for RLF recovery, the specific actions taken by UE and IAB-node after RLF declaration, and the mechanisms for transmitting RLF detection and recovery indications. Additionally, it should cover the suspension of Uu RLM by L2 U2N Remote UE and the actions taken by L2 U2N Relay UE after Uu RLF declaration."
What are the requirements and conditions for WLAN RSSI measurements in the RRC_CONNECTED state as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"In the RRC_CONNECTED state, when no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is used, the measurement period for WLAN Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is defined as TWLAN_RSSI. The value of TWLAN_RSSI varies depending on whether the measurement is performed on the serving access point (AP), a known neighbour AP, or an unknown neighbour AP. 

For a known single neighbour AP, the measurement is time-sensitive and performed on the AP for which the UE has information about the operating channel. For an unknown neighbour AP, the measurement is not time-sensitive and performed on the AP for which the UE does not have information about the operating channel.

The UE must be capable of performing WLAN RSSI measurements for a certain minimum number of APs during TWLAN_RSSI, provided that the beacon frame of the measured AP is available at the UE at least once every 102.4 ms. Additionally, the UE physical layer must be capable of reporting WLAN RSSI measurements to higher layers within the measurement period of TWLAN_RSSI.

The accuracy of WLAN RSSI measurements for all measured APs must meet the specifications outlined in clause 5.1.16. The normative references for these requirements are found in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.1.2.4.20 and A.8.25.2.","The answer must include:

Describe the procedures and SIP messaging involved in the CS to PS SRVCC access transfer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.237.,"The CS to PS SRVCC (Circuit Switched to Packet Switched Single Radio Voice Call Continuity) access transfer involves several procedures and SIP messaging steps as specified in 3GPP TS 24.237. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Initial Steps by MSC Server**:
   - Upon receiving a handover required indication for CS to PS SRVCC, the MSC server determines the transferable dialog set, which includes all SIP dialogs interworked with the CS calls of the UE and supporting a session.
   - If the transferable dialog set is not empty, the MSC server determines the dialog for communication with the ATCF (Access Transfer Control Function).

2. **Sending SIP INFO Requests**:
   - The MSC server sends a SIP INFO request within the determined dialog for communication with ATCF. This request includes:
     - `Info-Package` header field with value `g.3gpp.access-transfer-events`.
     - `application/vnd.3gpp.access-transfer-events+xml` MIME body indicating the session transfer notification request.
   - Upon receiving a SIP INFO request carrying the session transfer notification response, the MSC server sends a SIP 200 (OK) response and continues with the procedures based on whether the ATCF requires the MSC server to redirect the speech media component.

3. **Handling Premature Release of Dialog**:
   - If the dialog for communication with ATCF is released before sending the CS to PS handover command, the MSC server performs the procedures again as specified in subclause 12.4.2.2.

4. **Actions Based on ATGW Requirements**:
   - **When ATGW Does Not Require Speech Media Redirection**:
     - The MSC server sends a SIP INFO request indicating session transfer preparation or cancellation, depending on the status of the access transfer.
   - **When ATGW Requires Speech Media Redirection**:
     - The MSC server sends a SIP INVITE request with:
       - `Request-URI` header field set to the ATCF management URI.
       - `Contact` header field set to the IP address of MSC server.
       - SDP body including the speech media component of the session transferred.
       - `P-Asserted-Identity` header field set to the C-MSISDN.
     - After redirecting the speech media component, the MSC server sends a SIP INFO request indicating session transfer preparation or cancellation.

These procedures ensure the seamless transfer of voice calls from circuit-switched to packet-switched domains, maintaining call continuity during handovers.","The answer should cover the following key details:
1. The initial steps taken by the MSC server upon receiving a handover required indication for CS to PS SRVCC.
2. The determination of transferable dialog set and the conditions under which SIP INFO requests are sent.

"Describe the procedures and responses of the IP-SM-GW when handling Short Messages related to Chat Sessions, including acceptance, decline, and teardown requests.","The IP-SM-GW (IP Short Message Gateway) handles Short Messages related to Chat Sessions through a series of defined procedures and responses. 

1. **Handling Chat Session Invitations:**
   - When the IP-SM-GW receives a Short Message within an MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE associated with a Chat Session invitation, it checks the operator-defined answer in the message. 
   - If the user accepts the invitation, the IP-SM-GW sends a SIP 200 (OK) response to the associated SIP INVITE request.
   - If the user declines the invitation, the IP-SM-GW sends a SIP 603 (Decline) response to the associated SIP INVITE request.

2. **Sending SMS-DELIVER-REPORT and MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK Messages:**
   - If the IP-SM-GW decides to send an SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, it sends the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message to the SMS-GMSC. This message includes specific parameters such as Invoke Id, SM-RP-UI set to SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and various TP elements set according to defined standards.

3. **Handling Teardown Requests:**
   - When the IP-SM-GW receives a Short Message requesting to leave a Chat Session, it determines if the message is a teardown request based on the MSISDN assigned to the Chat Session and the operator-defined text indicating a teardown request.
   - If the message is a teardown request, the IP-SM-GW acknowledges the Short Message and sends a SIP BYE request to leave the group Chat Session or tear down a one-to-one Chat Session. If a specific MSISDN was associated with the Chat Session, it is released.

4. **Criteria for Associating Short Messages with Chat Sessions:**
   - A Short Message is associated with a Chat Session if it is addressed to the MSISDN assigned to the Chat Session and the originator of the message is the SM user invited to the Chat Session using that MSISDN.

These procedures ensure that the IP-SM-GW effectively manages Short Messages related to Chat Sessions, including handling user responses to invitations and requests to leave sessions.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- How the IP-SM-GW handles Short Messages related to Chat Session invitations, including sending SIP responses based on user acceptance or decline.

Describe the process and key elements involved in the provisioning of available UPFs in SMF using the NRF as per 3GPP specifications.,"The provisioning of available User Plane Functions (UPFs) in the Session Management Function (SMF) using the Network Repository Function (NRF) involves several key steps and elements as outlined in 3GPP specifications. Initially, there is an optional node-level step that occurs prior to selecting the UPF for PDU Sessions. This step may be followed by N4 Node Level procedures where the UPF and SMF exchange information regarding the support of optional functionalities and capabilities.

As part of the provisioning process, UPFs may register in the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister operation, which does not utilize N4. To learn about available UPFs, the SMF employs the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe, Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify, and Nnrf_NFDiscovery services.

The UPF Provisioning Information in the NRF includes several components:
- A list of Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI) and Data Network Names (DNN).
- UE IPv4 Address Ranges and/or IPv6 Prefix Range(s) per S-NSSAI and DNN, which can be used by the SMF for UPF selection when static IP address/prefix allocation is required for a UE.
- A SMF Area Identity that the UPF can serve, allowing the SMF to limit provisioning to UPFs associated with a certain SMF Area Identity.
- The supported Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) steering functionality, indicating whether Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) functionality or ATSSS-LL functionality or both are supported.
- The supported UPF event exposure service, such as local notification of QoS Monitoring to Application Function (AF) by Nupf_EventExposure_Notify.

Describe the procedures and actions taken by the transmission control server interface upon receiving Transmission Idle and Transmission Arbitration Taken messages from the controlling MCVideo function.,"Upon receiving a Transmission Idle message from the controlling MCVideo function, the transmission control server interface follows specific procedures based on whether the message contains a Track Info field or not. If the Transmission Idle message contains a Track Info field, the server interface uses the <Participant Reference> value at the end of the Track Info field to identify the transmission participant interface. If the Track Info field contains only one <Participant Reference> value, the server interface removes the Track Info field from the outgoing message, increases the stored message sequence number value by 1, and includes the updated local <Message Sequence Number> value in the Message Sequence Number field. If the Track Info field contains more than one <Participant Reference> value, the server interface removes the last <Participant Reference> value from the Track Info field. The server interface then sends the Transmission Idle message to the identified transmission participant interface. If the Transmission Idle message does not contain a Track Info field, the server interface sets the first bit in the subtype of the message to '0' (indicating that acknowledgement is not required) and sends the message to all transmission participant interfaces, including the received fields and the updated local <Message Sequence Number> value. If the first bit in the subtype of the received Transmission Idle message is set to '1' (indicating that acknowledgement is required), the server interface sends a Transmission Ack message to the controlling MCVideo function, including the Source field set to '3' (indicating the non-controlling MCVideo function as the source) and the Message Type field set to '5' (indicating Transmission Idle). Additionally, the server interface empties the passive transmission request queue.

Upon receiving a Transmission Arbitration Taken message from the controlling MCVideo function, the transmission control server interface also follows specific procedures based on the presence of a Track Info field. If the Transmission Arbitration Taken message contains a Track Info field, the server interface uses the <Participant Reference> value at the end of the Track Info field to identify the transmission participant interface. If the Track Info field contains only one <Participant Reference> value, the server interface removes the Track Info field from the outgoing message and includes the updated local <Message Sequence Number> value in the Message Sequence Number field. If the Track Info field contains more than one <Participant Reference> value, the server interface removes the last <Participant Reference> value from the Track Info field. The server interface then sends the Transmission Arbitration Taken message to the identified transmission participant interface. If the Transmission Arbitration Taken message does not contain a Track Info field, the server interface sets the first bit in the subtype of the message to '0' (indicating that acknowledgement is not required) and sends the message to the transmission participant interface.

"What are the requirements for adjusting the transmitter output power of E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS to minimize interference on adjacent channels licensed to other operators, according to 3GPP TS 36.104 and TS 36.141?","The requirements for adjusting the transmitter output power of E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS to minimize interference on adjacent channels licensed to other operators are specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 subclauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.4, and referenced in TS 36.141 subclauses 6.2.6.2 and 6.2.7.2.

According to TS 36.104 subclause 6.2.3, the Home BS must be capable of adjusting its transmitter output power to minimize interference on adjacent channels while optimizing coverage. This requirement applies under AWGN radio propagation conditions. The output power, Pout, is determined based on the input parameters CPICH Êc (code power of the Primary CPICH on adjacent channels) and Ioh (total received power density excluding the Home BS signal). If both adjacent channels are licensed to different operators, the most stringent limit applies. If one adjacent channel is licensed to an E-UTRA operator and the other to a UTRA operator, the more stringent limit of subclauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 applies. The requirements are specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS, and for receivers with diversity, they apply to each antenna connector separately. Table 6.2.3-1 provides details on the Home BS output power for adjacent operator UTRA channel protection.

Similarly, TS 36.104 subclause 6.2.4 outlines the requirements for adjusting the transmitter output power to minimize interference on adjacent channels. The output power, Pout, is determined based on the input parameters CRS Ês (Reference Signal Received Power per resource element on adjacent channels) and Ioh. The same conditions apply regarding adjacent channels licensed to different operators. The requirements are specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS, and for receivers with diversity, they apply to each antenna connector separately. Table 6.2.4-1 provides details on the Home BS output power for adjacent operator E-UTRA channel protection.

"Describe the procedures for group-based C2 QoS provisioning and group update in 3GPP TS 23.255, and how these procedures interact with the network resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434.","The procedures for group-based C2 QoS provisioning and group update in 3GPP TS 23.255 involve several steps and preconditions, and they interact closely with network resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434.

For group-based C2 QoS provisioning, the preconditions include the registration of both UAV and UAV-C to the 3GPP 5G network and the establishment of C2 communication. The procedure begins with the UAE server monitoring the QoS for the UAS group, which includes a UAV and UAV-C, using SEAL NRM as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434. If the network conditions do not meet the predefined QoS requirements, the UAE server may send a QoS adaptation request to the SEAL NRM server using the NRM-S reference point. This request is sent per group ID for the UAV and UAV-C pair created in the group creation procedure. The network resource adaptation procedure is then triggered by the UAE server, and communication is established based on the new QoS requirements. The UAS application layer adapts the updated QoS assignment, although the mechanisms for this adaptation are out of scope of the document.

The procedure for group update involves updating the group membership when UAV-2 replaces UAV-1. The preconditions include the successful subscription of UAV-C, UAV-1, and UAV-2 with the 3GPP Core Network and UAS application-specific server, and the assignment of a 3GPP UE ID and a CAA-level UAV ID. The UAE server recognizes the new pair of UAV-2 and UAV-C by the new CAA-level UAV ID and sends a group membership update request to the SEAL GM server. The SEAL GM server then sends a group membership update response.

The group creation procedure involves recognizing a unique pair of UAV and UAV-C by either 3GPP UE ID or CAA-level UAV ID, sending a group creation request to the SEAL GM server if there is no pre-assigned group ID, and using the returned group ID for UAS QoS management.

These procedures interact with network resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434. During session establishment, the VAL server sends a request for resources to the NRM server, which evaluates the need for network resources and resource sharing. The NRM server sends a session progress request containing the resource request, and PCC procedures are initiated from the SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy. The SIP core proxy sends an OK message to the NRM server, which then sends a resource response to the VAL server, establishing VAL service communication with allocated resources.","Key details the answer must include:

New specifications using IKE should refer to this profile with minimal exceptions. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the 3GPP IKEv2 profile applies to all uses of IKEv2 for protecting 3GPP interfaces. Additionally, clause 6.2.1b of TS 33.310 provides further requirements for certificate-based IKEv2 authentication. For implementation requirements and usage guidance, RFC 7296 has been updated in RFC 8247, and in this case, RFC 8247 and the present document take precedence over RFC 7296.

For TLS, the general 3GPP TLS profile is specified in clause 6.2.1. Similar to IKEv2, this profile is referenced by other 3GPP specifications, and parts of the profile may apply to devices and network nodes as specified in those other specifications. New specifications using TLS should refer to this profile with minimal exceptions. DTLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 6347, is based on TLS 1.2, and all requirements defined in the TLS profile apply to the DTLS protocol as well. TLS endpoints must support TLS with certain restrictions and extensions. Specifically, SSL 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and DTLS 1.0 are not supported. TLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 5246, and TLS 1.3, as specified in RFC 8446, must be supported. If DTLS is supported, then DTLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 6347, must be supported. Additionally, if the TLS connection is used to transport HTTP over TLS, as specified in RFC 2818, the client must not establish a connection 'upgraded to TLS Within HTTP/1.1' per RFC 2817, but must establish the tunnel over a raw TCP connection.","The answer should cover the general profiles for IKEv2 and TLS as specified in 3GPP TS 33.210. It should include the applicability of these profiles to devices and network nodes, the specific requirements for certificate-based IKEv2 authentication, and the precedence of RFC 8247 over RFC 7296 for IKEv2. For TLS, the answer should detail the supported and unsupported versions, the applicability of the profile to DTLS, and the restrictions and extensions for TLS connections, including the prohibition of 'upgraded to TLS Within HTTP/1.1' connections."
Describe the process and information elements involved in a Session with QoS update request and response between the EAS and the EES as per 3GPP TS 23.558.,"The process of a Session with QoS update request between the EAS (External Application Server) and the EES (External Exposure Server) involves several steps and specific information elements. 

Firstly, the EAS initiates the request to modify the QoS (Quality of Service) of the data session between the AC (Application Client) and the EAS. This request may include a different QoS reference or bandwidth value and must include the Context ID. Additionally, the EAS can request modifications to event monitoring by subscribing to new events or updating/removing subscriptions to existing events.

Upon receiving the request, the EES checks if there is an available context for the provided Context ID and verifies if the EAS is authorized to perform this operation. If authorized and the UE (User Equipment) IP address is known, the EES invokes the Policy Authorization Update service or AF Session with QoS Update service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF) to provide the updated information. The EES may also subscribe to or unsubscribe from certain events as necessary.

If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. In case of authorization failure or any other issues, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information. The resource allocation outcome, such as the successful modification of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, is reported separately through a session with QoS notify operation.

The information elements required for a Session with QoS update request from the EAS to the EES are detailed in Table 8.6.6.3.4-1. Similarly, the information elements for the response from the EES to the EAS are specified in Table 8.6.6.3.5-1.

The API operation name for this process is Eees_SessionWithQoS_Update. The operation allows the consumer to request a modification of the QoS of the data session with the UE and update event notifications related to user plane traffic. The inputs for this operation are described in clause 8.6.6.3.4, and the outputs are detailed in clause 8.6.6.3.5. For further details on the usage of this operation, refer to clause 8.6.6.2.3.","The answer must include a detailed description of the sequence of operations for a QoS update request, including the roles and responsibilities of the EAS and EES. It should list the information elements required for both the request and response as specified in the respective tables. Additionally, it should mention the API operation name and its description, along with references to the relevant clauses for inputs, outputs, and detailed usage."
Describe the characteristics and functionalities of the CTS beacon channel (CTSBCH) and the burst types used for CTSAGCH and CTSPCH in the CTS system.,"The CTS beacon channel (CTSBCH) is a key component in the CTS system, transmitted by the CTS-FP every 26 frames in a 52-multiframe pattern. This channel allows the CTS-MS to synchronize with the CTS-FP and supports minimal signaling, making it the only logical channel that the CTS-FP periodically transmits on the CTS radio interface. Other logical channels are transmitted only on demand.

For the CTS Access Grant Channel (CTSAGCH), Normal Bursts (NB) are used. The training sequence for these bursts is determined by the three least significant bits (LSBs) of the FPBI, forming a 3-bit training sequence code (TSC) that selects one of the eight training sequences specified in GSM 05.02 subclause 5.2.3. The channel coding and interleaving schemes for the CTSAGCH are the same as those used for the SACCH, as specified in GSM 05.03 subclause 4.1, and are applied over 4 consecutive bursts.

Similarly, the CTS Paging Channel (CTSPCH) also uses Normal Bursts (NB). The training sequence for these bursts is determined by the three LSBs of the FPBI, forming a 3-bit TSC that selects one of the eight training sequences specified in GSM 05.02 subclause 5.2.3. The channel coding and interleaving schemes for the CTSPCH are identical to those used for the SACCH, as specified in GSM 05.03 subclause 4.1, and are applied over 4 consecutive bursts.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The CTSBCH is transmitted by the CTS-FP every 26 frames in a 52-multiframe pattern and supports synchronization and minimal signaling.
  - The CTSAGCH uses Normal Bursts (NB), with the training sequence determined by the three LSBs of the FPBI, and employs the same channel coding and interleaving schemes as the SACCH over 4 consecutive bursts.
  - The CTSPCH also uses Normal Bursts (NB), with the training sequence determined by the three LSBs of the FPBI, and employs the same channel coding and interleaving schemes as the SACCH over 4 consecutive bursts."
What are the requirements for the 'Cache-Control' header in HTTP responses according to 3GPP TS 29.504?,"According to 3GPP TS 29.504, the 'Cache-Control' header must be included in HTTP responses that carry a representation of cacheable resources, as described in IETF RFC 7234 clause 5.2. This header should contain a 'max-age' value, which indicates the amount of time in seconds after which the received response is considered stale. The 'max-age' value is configurable by operator policy, allowing operators to set the duration based on their specific requirements.","The answer should cover the necessity of including a 'Cache-Control' header in HTTP responses for cacheable resources as per IETF RFC 7234 clause 5.2. It should specify that the 'max-age' value must be included, indicating the time in seconds after which the response is considered stale. Additionally, it should mention that the 'max-age' value is configurable by operator policy."
"Describe the priority treatment and QoS characteristics for MPS sessions in 3GPP networks, including the handling of MPS for Data Transport Service (DTS).","In 3GPP networks, MPS (Mission Critical Push-to-Talk) sessions receive priority treatment to ensure reliable communication for service users. When a terminating network receives an incoming MPS session establishment attempt, the session is given priority access to signalling and media bearer resources for voice, video, and data based on the originating service user's priority information. If the necessary resources cannot be assigned immediately, the MPS session request is queued and processed for the next available resource according to the service user's priority level and session arrival time. The network also supports informing the calling service user about the status of the MPS session, such as indicating that the session request has been queued. If the queued MPS session times out, normal session processing applies.

Regarding QoS (Quality of Service) characteristics, MPS sessions may have the same QoS characteristics as the underlying communication service used to support the session, with priority treatment subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies. In some cases, specific QoS characteristics may be requested for the MPS session. The 3GPP network allows for the selection, configuration, and enforcement of appropriate QoS rules for MPS voice, video, and data. The system supports retaining MPS during transient network degradation conditions and recovery, and re-verifying any recovered MPS session afterwards.

MPS for Data Transport Service (DTS) is a priority packet transport service that applies independently of the specific data application being used. It provides service users with priority for applications using the default bearer or QoS flow associated with the default QoS rule during periods of severe network congestion. The system supports MPS for DTS for authorized service users using a UE (User Equipment) with a subscription for MPS, as well as for users without an MPS subscription. MPS for DTS can be used to obtain priority access to enterprise networks, such as private corporate or government agency networks, to download data and access applications like email, text/chat/presence, voice, and video.

For IoT (Internet of Things) devices with an MPS subscription, MPS for DTS provides priority for applications using a specific default bearer or QoS flow towards a single specified PDN/DN. The system supports end-to-end MPS for DTS connections between MPS subscribed IoT devices and associated enterprise networks based on operator policy and agreements. Authorized enterprise networks supporting MPS can activate priority for remote MPS subscribed UEs and IoT devices associated with the enterprise network on demand, based on operator policy and agreements.","The answer should cover the priority treatment for MPS sessions, including queuing and resource assignment in the terminating PLMN. It should explain the QoS characteristics and rules for MPS sessions, and how these are enforced and retained during network degradation. Additionally, the answer should detail the MPS for Data Transport Service (DTS), including priority access for applications, support for authorized Service Users and IoT devices, and the end-to-end connection to enterprise networks."
Describe the requirements for UE measurements and reselection criteria in normal coverage areas as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 4.2.25.3.,"In normal coverage areas, the User Equipment (UE) must adhere to specific requirements for measurements and cell reselection as outlined in 3GPP TS 36.521 4.2.25.3. The UE is considered to be in the normal coverage area of the serving cell based on Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), RSRP Ês/Iot, Synchronization Channel Received Power (SCH_RP), and SCH Ês/Iot, as defined in Annex B.1.3 of 3GPP TS 36.133 for the corresponding band.

The UE must be capable of identifying new inter-frequency cells and performing RSRP or Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) measurements on these cells if the serving cell provides carrier frequency information, even without an explicit neighbor list. During these measurements, the UE must ensure that there is no interruption to paging reception and acquisition of System Information (SI).

The conditions for inter-frequency search are based on Srxlev and Squal values. If Srxlev > SnonIntraSearchP and Squal > SnonIntraSearchQ, the UE must search for higher priority inter-frequency layers at least every Thigher_priority_search, as described in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 36.133. If Srxlev ≤ SnonIntraSearchP or Squal ≤ SnonIntraSearchQ, the UE must search for and measure inter-frequency layers of higher, equal, or lower priority in preparation for possible reselection.

The UE must evaluate whether a newly detectable inter-frequency cell meets the reselection criteria defined in 3GPP TS 36.304 within Tdetect,EUTRAN_Inter_NC, provided that the reselection criteria are met by a margin of at least 7 dB for reselections based on ranking, 7 dB for RSRP reselections based on absolute priorities, or 5 dB for RSRQ reselections based on absolute priorities. The detection of inter-frequency cells is based on RSRP, RSRP Ês/Iot, SCH_RP, and SCH Ês/Iot as defined in Annex B.1.8 of 3GPP TS 36.133.

For higher priority cells found during the search, the UE must measure them at least every Tmeasure,EUTRAN_Inter_NC. If reselection does not occur after detecting a higher priority cell, the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell but must meet the minimum measurement filtering requirements before stopping the measurements. The UE must filter RSRP or RSRQ measurements using at least two measurements spaced by at least Tmeasure,EUTRAN_Inter_NC/2.

The UE must not consider an E-UTRA neighbor cell for reselection if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of the serving cell. For cells already detected but not reselected, the UE must evaluate them within Tevaluate,EUTRAN_Inter_NC, provided the reselection criteria are met by the specified dB margins.

If the Treselection timer has a non-zero value and the inter-frequency cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE must evaluate the inter-frequency cell for the Treselection time. If the cell remains better ranked within this duration, the UE must reselect that cell.

For UEs not configured with eDRX_IDLE cycle, the specific timing values Tdetect,EUTRAN_Inter_NC, Tmeasure,EUTRAN_Inter_NC, and Tevaluate,EUTRAN_Inter_NC are specified in Table 4.2.25.3-1. For higher priority cells, the UE may optionally use a shorter value for Tmeasure,EUTRAN_Inter_NC, which must not be less than Max(0.64 s, one DRX cycle).

These requirements are normatively referenced in TS 36.133 clause 4.7.2.1.3 and A.4.2.25.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of normal coverage area conditions for UE
  - Requirements for UE to identify and measure inter-frequency cells
  - Conditions for inter-frequency search based on Srxlev and Squal
  - Criteria for evaluating newly detectable inter-frequency cells and reselection criteria
  - Measurement intervals and filtering requirements for RSRP or RSRQ
  - Conditions for cell reselection based on Treselection timer
  - Specific timing values and their significance
  - References to relevant clauses in TS 36.133 and TS 36.304"
"Describe the process and requirements for the CHF to send a subscription termination notification to the NF service consumer, including the handling of errors and redirections.","The CHF (Charging Function) sends a subscription termination notification to the NF (Network Function) service consumer by issuing an HTTP POST request to the notification target address (notifUri) provided during subscription creation or modification. The URI is appended with the 'terminate' segment path to indicate the termination of the subscription and the removal of the Individual Spending Limit Retrieval Subscription resource.

The request body of the HTTP POST includes the SubscriptionTerminationInfo data structure, which must contain the subscriber identification encoded in the 'supi' attribute. If the 'NotificationCorrelation' feature is supported, the Notification Correlation Id is included in the 'notifId' attribute. Additionally, the 'termCause' attribute may be included to provide subscription termination information. If the termination is due to the subscriber identified by the SUPI being removed from the CHF, the 'termCause' attribute is set to 'REMOVED_SUBSCRIBER'.

Upon receiving the termination request, the NF service consumer processes it and, if successful, responds with a '204 No Content' status, indicating the subscription to notifications of all policy counters for the subscriber has been removed. If there are errors during processing, the NF service consumer sends an appropriate HTTP error response as specified in the relevant documentation.

If the 'ES3XX' feature is supported and the NF service consumer determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, it sends an HTTP redirect response as specified in the applicable standards.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The CHF's process for sending a subscription termination notification, including the HTTP POST request and the 'terminate' segment path.
  - The required attributes in the SubscriptionTerminationInfo data structure.
  - The NF service consumer's response to the notification request, including '204 No Content' for successful processing and HTTP error responses for issues.
  - Handling of redirections by the NF service consumer, including the conditions under which an HTTP redirect response is sent."
"Describe the process and requirements for modifying an existing Individual ACR Management Events Subscription using HTTP PATCH and PUT methods, including error handling and redirection.","To modify an existing Individual ACR Management Events Subscription, the EAS can use either an HTTP PATCH request for partial modifications or an HTTP PUT request for full replacements. The resource URI for these requests is 'Individual ACR Management Events Subscription'.

Upon receiving a PATCH or PUT request, the EES must first check if the EAS is authorized to update the subscription. If authorized, and if the subscription includes UP path change events, the EES will either use locally cached UP path change event information or interact with the NEF using the TrafficInfluence API to request notifications for UP path change events. The EES may also use the AnalyticsExposure API to subscribe to or retrieve UE mobility and communication events.

For PATCH requests, the method supports specific URI query parameters, request data structures, and response data structures as outlined in tables 8.6.2.3.3.1-1 to 8.6.2.3.3.1-3. Similarly, PUT requests support their own set of URI query parameters, request data structures, and response data structures as specified in tables 8.6.2.3.3.2-1 to 8.6.2.3.3.2-3. Both methods also support headers for HTTP 307 and 308 response codes, which are used for redirection.

Error handling procedures are defined in clause 8.6.6, and general error responses are covered in clause 7.7. If the EES encounters an error, it will respond with the appropriate error status code. If redirection is necessary, the EES may respond with a 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, including a Location header with the URI of the alternative endpoint.

In summary, the modification process involves authorization checks, potential interaction with NEF for event notifications, adherence to specific data structures and parameters for PATCH and PUT requests, error handling, and possible redirection using HTTP status codes 307 and 308.","The answer should cover the following key points:
1. The types of HTTP requests (PATCH and PUT) used for modifying the subscription and their specific purposes.
2. The authorization checks performed by the EES upon receiving the requests.

"Describe the command syntax and functionality of the +CLADN parameter, and explain the structure and purpose of the LADN information element.","The +CLADN parameter command syntax includes set, read, and test commands, each serving distinct functions. The set command controls the presentation of LADN information to the Terminal Equipment (TE) by an unsolicited result code +CLADNU: <ladn_information_length>,<ladn_information> when there is a change in the LADN information stored at the Mobile Terminal (MT). For each Local Area Data Network (LADN), the LADN information consists of a Data Network Name (DNN) and a tracking identity list. If <ladn_information_length> is zero and <ladn_information> is an empty string, no LADN information is stored on the MT.

The read command returns <n>, indicating whether the reporting of LADN information is enabled or disabled. It also returns the current values of <ladn_information_length> and <ladn_information> if available. The test command returns values supported as a compound value.

Defined values for <n> are:
0 - disable unsolicited result code +CLADNU: <ladn_information_length>,<ladn_information>
1 - enable unsolicited result code +CLADNU: <ladn_information_length>,<ladn_information>

<ladn_information_length> is an integer type indicating the number of octets of the <ladn_information> information element. If the value is zero, no LADN information is stored on the MT. <ladn_information> is a string type in hexadecimal format, indicating the LADN information for one or more LADNs, where each LADN consists of a DNN and a tracking area identity list.

Describe the procedures for PDU session establishment via untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks.,"The procedures for PDU session establishment via untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks involve several steps and modifications based on the type of access network. 

For untrusted non-3GPP access networks, the process begins with the UE initiating a PDU session establishment. If it is an initial request, the steps are similar to those described in figure 5.2.2.2.1, involving initial SMF interaction with CHF and a Charging Data Request [Initial]. For an existing PDU session, a 'radio access type change' trigger may apply, leading to SMF interaction with CHF and a Charging Data Request [Update].

For trusted non-3GPP access networks, the procedure is similar to that for untrusted non-3GPP access networks but with specific modifications. After the UE registers to the 5GC via a trusted non-3GPP access network, it may request a PDU session establishment using the same procedure as for untrusted access, with the following changes:
- The N3IWF in the procedure is substituted with a TNGF, and the untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted with a Trusted non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP).
- The Charging Data Request [Initial/Update] includes RAT type and user location specifics to trusted non-3GPP.
- The TNGF may send a TNGF Identities parameter to the AMF inside an N2 Uplink NAS Transport message. This parameter contains a list of identifiers (e.g., FQDNs or IP addresses) of N3 terminations supported by the TNGF. If received by the AMF, it forwards this information to the SMF, which may use it as input for UPF selection.

These procedures ensure that the PDU session establishment is appropriately handled based on the type of access network, maintaining efficient and secure connectivity for the UE.","The answer should cover the general procedure for PDU session establishment in 5GC as described in TS 23.502. It should then detail the specific steps for PDU session establishment via untrusted non-3GPP access network, including the initial request and existing PDU session scenarios. The modifications for trusted non-3GPP access network should be explained, including the substitution of N3IWF with TNGF and the specifics of Charging Data Request. Finally, the role of TNGF Identities parameter in UPF selection should be described."
"What are the procedures and responses of the MSC Server upon receiving an initial INVITE request, including scenarios where the terminating user is not reachable and the handling of specific header fields?","Upon receiving an initial INVITE request, the MSC Server follows a series of validation and response procedures. Firstly, the MSC Server validates the INVITE request and any SDP offer present. It identifies the terminating subscriber using the P-Called-Party-ID header or Request-URI from the INVITE request to retrieve the VLR data. If the VLR data cannot be retrieved, the MSC Server sends a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the INVITE request, including the Reason header field with the protocol header field parameter set to 'Q.850' and the cause header field parameter set to '20'. If the VLR data can be retrieved, the MSC Server checks if the IMSI is detached; if so, it sends a 480 (Temporarily unavailable) response.

Upon successful validation of the terminating party, the MSC Server initiates the establishment of an MM connection. If the MM connection cannot be established, such as when no PAGE RESPONSE message is received, the MSC Server sends a 408 (Request Timeout) response. If the INVITE request includes a MIME body part with the 'communication-waiting-indication' element, and the MSC Server determines that the incoming call can be presented to the subscriber, specific procedures apply.

The MSC Server stores the 'icid-value' header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header field. Regarding the SIP precondition mechanism, if the INVITE request does not contain a 'precondition' option-tag, the MSC Server does not use the SIP precondition mechanism. If the 'precondition' option-tag is present and local configuration supports it, the MSC Server uses the SIP precondition mechanism and includes the Require header field with the 'precondition' option-tag in responses containing the SDP body.

If the MSC Server determines the terminating user is not reachable prior to sending the SETUP message, it returns the appropriate response to the INVITE request to allow CFNRc to be initiated in the IM CN subsystem. For scenarios not described in the relevant clause, the MSC Server sends a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the initial INVITE request. Depending on operator policy, the MSC Server may include a Response-Source header field with an 'fe' header field parameter constructed with the URN namespace 'urn:3gpp:fe', the 'fe-id' part set to 'msc-server', and the 'role' header field parameter set to 'msc-server-ics'.","The answer should cover the following key points:
- The validation process of the INVITE request and SDP offer by the MSC Server.
- Identification and validation of the terminating subscriber using the P-Called-Party-ID header or Request-URI.
- Actions taken if VLR data cannot be retrieved or if the IMSI is detached.
- Procedures for establishing an MM connection and handling scenarios where the connection cannot be established.
- Handling of MIME body parts in the INVITE request and conditions for presenting incoming calls to the subscriber.
- Storage of the 'icid-value' header field parameter.
- Conditions for using the SIP precondition mechanism and the inclusion of the 'precondition' option-tag in responses.
- Responses when the terminating user is not reachable prior to sending the SETUP message, including the potential inclusion of the Response-Source header field with specific parameters."
"What are the key specifications for MBMS bearer management in MC services as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.280 5.2.7.1, and how are these specifications referenced in other related 3GPP documents?","The key specifications for MBMS bearer management in MC services as outlined in 3GPP TS 23.280 5.2.7.1 include several important aspects. Firstly, the MC service can provide downlink MBMS delivery of MC service media and application-level control messages targeted towards multiple MC clients simultaneously, such as floor idle and floor taken messages for MCPTT services. MC service UEs are capable of receiving traffic delivered via MBMS regardless of the availability of unicast radio bearers. When switching between different downlink bearers, MC service UEs must preserve the reception context to minimize service interruption. Additionally, the MC service should enable an MC service UE in an ongoing MC service group session that enters an area of media delivery via MBMS bearers to immediately start receiving the media for that session via MBMS. The MC service server must ensure that MC service group sessions are not mapped to MBMS bearers that cannot provide the required QoS for the group. Furthermore, an MC service UE using MBSFN transmission should be able to support eight MBSFN areas simultaneously on the same RF carrier.

These specifications are consistently referenced in other related 3GPP documents, highlighting their importance. For instance, TS 23.281 5.5.4, TS 23.282 5.8.4, and TS 23.379 5.7.4 all refer to the MBMS bearer management for MC services as specified in TS 23.280 5.2.7.1. This cross-referencing ensures that the guidelines for MBMS bearer management are uniformly understood and implemented across different aspects of MC services within the 3GPP framework.","The answer should include the detailed specifications from TS 23.280 5.2.7.1, such as the ability to provide downlink MBMS delivery of media and control messages, the requirement for MC service UEs to preserve reception context, immediate media reception upon entering MBMS area, QoS requirements for MBMS bearers, and support for MBSFN transmission. Additionally, the answer should mention how these specifications are referenced in TS 23.281, TS 23.282, and TS 23.379, indicating the importance and consistency of these specifications across multiple 3GPP documents."
"Describe the procedures for updating on-network dynamic group information, including the roles of VAE clients and servers, and the consent process.","The procedures for updating on-network dynamic group information involve several steps and roles for VAE clients and servers, as well as a consent process. 

1. **Pre-conditions for Initiating the Update Procedures:**
   - The on-network dynamic group must already be defined, with V2X UE A and V2X UE B as members.
   - V2X UE A is the current group leader.
   - The V2X application specific client or server determines the need to update the group information, such as changing the group leader from V2X UE A to V2X UE B, and informs the relevant VAE client or server.

2. **VAE Client Initiated Update Procedure:**
   - The VAE client A sends a Dynamic group information update request to the VAE server, including the group-ID, updated group information (e.g., identity of V2X UE B as the new group leader), and other relevant details (e.g., whether the update is temporary or permanent).
   - The VAE server checks the authorization of the V2X user to update the group information and validates the updated information. If necessary, it consults with the V2X application specific server to ensure the proposed group leader's capabilities.
   - If the request is authorized and the updated information is valid, the VAE server acknowledges the VAE client A.
   - If consent from other group members is required (e.g., from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B), the VAE server obtains this consent as specified in the consent process.
   - The VAE server sends a Dynamic group information update change response to VAE client A, indicating success or failure. If the update is unsuccessful, the server may suggest alternative updates.
   - Upon successful update, the VAE server updates the group document and triggers a notification to other group members and the V2X application specific server.

3. **VAE Server Initiated Update Procedure:**
   - If the V2X application specific server determines the need to update the group information, it informs the VAE server.
   - The VAE server obtains consent from the group members if required, as specified in the consent process.
   - The VAE server sends a Dynamic group information update indication to VAE client A about the possible update.
   - VAE client A notifies the V2X application specific client A about the possible update.
   - If the update is successful, the VAE server updates the group document and triggers a notification to other group members and the V2X application specific server.

4. **Consent Process:**
   - If the update requires consent from other group members, the VAE server sends a Dynamic group information update consent request to the relevant VAE client (e.g., VAE client B for the proposed new group leader).
   - The VAE client B notifies the V2X application specific client B, who decides to accept or reject the request.
   - VAE client B sends a Dynamic group information update consent response to the VAE server, indicating acceptance or rejection.

"Describe the process and key elements involved in updating the registration information of API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function, including the relevant API operation.","The process of updating the registration information of API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core function involves several key steps and elements. The API management function initiates the process by sending a registration update request to the CAPIF core function. This request contains a list of information about all the API provider domain functions that require a registration update.

Upon receiving the registration update request, the CAPIF core function validates the request and updates the identity and other security-related information for all the API provider domain functions listed. After validation and updating, the CAPIF core function sends the updated information back to the API management function in a registration update response message. The API management function then configures the received information to the individual API provider domain functions.

The relevant API operation for this process is named 'Update_API_Provider'. This operation is used to update the registration information of the API provider domain functions. The known consumer of this API operation is the API management function. The inputs for this operation are detailed in subclause 8.29.2.1, and the outputs are detailed in subclause 8.29.2.2. For a comprehensive understanding of the usage of this API operation, one should refer to subclause 8.29.3, which outlines the detailed procedure for updating the registration information.","The answer should include the following key details: 
  - The role of the API management function and CAPIF core function in the registration update process.
  - The specific information flows for registration update request and response.
  - The detailed procedure for updating registration information, including validation and configuration steps.
  - The API operation name 'Update_API_Provider', its description, known consumers, inputs, outputs, and reference to the detailed procedure."
"Describe the session establishment and mid-session procedures involving IMS-ALG supporting OMR, including scenarios with transcoding as part of the OMR process.","The session establishment process involving IMS-ALG supporting Optimized Media Routing (OMR) begins with the IMS-ALG receiving a SIP INVITE with an SDP offer from the originating side. This offer includes the transport address allocated in realm R1 for the media on the incoming leg and potential OMR information from prior user plane segments. The IMS-ALG determines that the outgoing IP realm (R2) is different from the incoming IP realm (R1) and interacts with a gateway to allocate a local transport address for the media on the outgoing leg in realm R2. The IMS-ALG then generates a SIP INVITE towards the destination side with a new SDP offer that includes the local transport address and OMR extensions for further OMR decisions. The destination side responds with a SIP 200 OK and an SDP answer, providing the transport address allocated for the media on the outgoing leg, which results in bypassing the local gateway due to the OMR process. The IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer for the media on the incoming leg and sends a Charging Data Request[Start] to record the start of the session with indications that the local gateway is not inserted and the IP realm is not the default. The user plane connection is established in realm R1 without gateway insertion for the media.

In mid-session procedures, when a SIP RE-INVITE or SIP UPDATE is generated to add or update a media component, the OMR process is applied again. The steps are similar to the initial session establishment, with the IMS-ALG receiving a SIP RE-INVITE instead of a SIP INVITE, and sending a Charging Data Request[Interim] to record the update of the session. The CDF updates the session CDR for the IMS node and acknowledges the reception of the data.

Transcoding is also part of the OMR process, as described in dedicated flows for simplification. These procedures apply specifically to IBCF/TrGW nodes. The transcoding aspect is integrated into the same SDP offer/answer exchanges described in the session establishment and mid-session procedures, ensuring optimized media routing with the necessary transcoding operations.","The answer must include a detailed description of the session establishment process with IMS-ALG supporting OMR, highlighting the steps involved in the SDP offer/answer exchange and the bypassing of the local GW. It should also cover the mid-session procedure with SIP RE-INVITE or SIP UPDATE, explaining the changes in the media path and the corresponding Charging Data Request[Interim]. Additionally, the answer should address the role of transcoding in the OMR process, specifying the dedicated flows and the applicability to IBCF/TrGW."

What are the requirements and conditions for UE measurements and reporting in the context of secondary component carriers (SCC) as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521?,"The requirements and conditions for UE measurements and reporting in the context of secondary component carriers (SCC) as specified in 3GPP TS 36.521 include several key aspects:

1. **Identification of New Detectable Cells**: When no Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is in use, the UE must be able to identify a new detectable Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or Time Division Duplex (TDD) cell on the SCC within a time period defined as Tidentify_scc, which is calculated as 20 times the parameter measCycleSCell.

2. **Conditions for Detectability**: A cell is considered detectable if the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) conditions specified in Clause 9.1 are met for the corresponding band, and the Synchronization Channel Received Power (SCH_RP|dBm) and SCH Ês/Iot conditions specified in Annex I.2.7 are fulfilled.

3. **Measurement Period for Deactivated SCC**: The measurement period for deactivated SCC measurements is defined as Tmeasure_scc, which is 5 times the parameter measCycleSCell. During this period, the UE must be capable of performing RSRP and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) measurements for up to 8 identified cells on the SCC and report these measurements to higher layers.

4. **Measurement Accuracy**: The accuracy of measurements for all measured cells must comply with the specifications in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.11, which covers carrier aggregation measurement accuracy.

5. **Reconfiguration of Receiver Bandwidth or RF Chains**: The UE may reconfigure the receiver bandwidth or turn on/off one of the RF chains when performing measurements on an SCC with a deactivated SCell. This reconfiguration may cause interruptions on the Primary Cell (PCell), as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 7.8.

6. **Event Triggered Measurement Reports**: The UE must meet the requirements for event triggered measurement reports as outlined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9. The UE should not send any event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled.

7. **Measurement Reporting Delay**: The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that triggers a measurement report and the point when the UE starts transmitting the report over the air interface. This delay should be less than Tidentify_scc as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.3.3.2.1, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling or lack of uplink resources. If L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

8. **Normative References**: The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 8.3.3.2.1 and A.8.16.5, which provide detailed guidelines on measurement reporting delays and conditions.

"What are the different types of events that trigger a location update as defined in TS 29.345, and how do they differ in terms of UE availability, change of area, and periodic location updates?","The types of events that trigger a location update as defined in TS 29.345 are categorized into three main types: UE availability, change of area, and periodic location updates.

1. **UE Availability (UE_AVAILABLE)**: This event type indicates that the location update trigger is any event in which the MSC/SGSN/MME has established contact with the User Equipment (UE). Essentially, it covers scenarios where the network has successfully communicated with the UE.

2. **Change of Area (CHANGE_OF_AREA)**: This event type is triggered when the UE enters or leaves a pre-defined geographical area or if the UE is currently within the pre-defined geographical area. It encompasses three specific sub-events:
   - **UE Entry (UE_ENTRY)**: Indicates the event trigger is the UE entering a pre-defined geographical area.
   - **UE Exit (UE_EXIT)**: Indicates the event trigger is the UE leaving a pre-defined geographical area.
   - **UE Presence (UE_PRESENCE)**: Indicates the event trigger is the current presence of the UE within a pre-defined geographical area.

3. **Periodic Location (PERIODIC_LOCATION)**: This event type is triggered when a defined periodic timer expires in the UE, activating a location report or a location request. It ensures regular updates based on a set time interval.

These types of events are further detailed in clause 4.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.271, which provides additional context and conditions for each type of location update trigger.","The answer should include the definitions and conditions for each type of event that triggers a location update as per TS 29.345.

"Describe the ASN.1 definitions and the structure of Arguments, Results, and Information Elements as specified in TS 48.031.","The ASN.1 definitions and the structure of Arguments, Results, and Information Elements in TS 48.031 are detailed comprehensively. The document specifies operation-specific information in the Response message, with Annex B providing the contents for each operation.

The formal ASN.1 definitions include various structures such as RIT-Indication-Arg, RIT-Query-Arg, DecipheringKeys-Arg, and their respective Result structures. For instance, the RIT-Indication-Arg is defined as a sequence containing elements like referenceClock, rit-ATDRTDQualityRes, rit-ATDRTDChangeQualityRes, rit-Data, and an optional extensionContainer. Similarly, the RIT-IndicationRsp-Arg is a sequence with an optional extensionContainer.

The RIT-Query-Arg includes elements such as requestType, rit-RequestDellList, and an optional extensionContainer, while the RIT-QueryRsp-Arg is a sequence with an optional extensionContainer. The RIT-StopQuery-Arg and RIT-StopQueryRsp-Arg follow similar structures with optional extensionContainer elements.

DecipheringKeys-Arg is defined as a sequence containing decipheringKeyType, decipheringKeySet, lac, and an optional extensionContainer, with the corresponding Result structure, DecipheringKeysRsp-Arg, also including an optional extensionContainer.

Information Elements are crucial as they define the data types and structures used in the arguments and results. For example, RequestType is a choice between singleSending and openEnded, with openEnded further defined as a sequence containing reportingPeriodInfo, changeLimit, and deviationLimitInfo. ReportingPeriodInfo is a sequence with periodFormat and periodValue, where periodFormat is enumerated as tensOfSeconds or tensOfMinutes.

"Describe the behavior and procedures of the IMS-ALG when interworking SIP messages, particularly focusing on SDP modifications, error recovery, and bandwidth negotiation.","The IMS-ALG acts as a SIP Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) when interworking SIP messages, forwarding all SIP messages transparently with respect to methods, result codes, headers, and attachments, except for specific modifications. The IMS-ALG modifies SDP according to subclauses 9.1.1, 9.1.3, 9.1.5, and clause 10. When forwarding incoming SIP requests, the IMS-ALG performs User Agent Client (UAC) procedures towards the intended target by modifying necessary headers to ensure all transactions within the dialog pass through the IMS-ALG. Similarly, for incoming SIP responses, it performs User Agent Server (UAS) procedures towards the originator of the corresponding request, modifying headers as needed.

In the event of receiving inconsistent incoming messages, the IMS-ALG may perform appropriate error recovery procedures. Upon receiving a SIP BYE request, SIP CANCEL request, or non-200 SIP final response, the IMS-ALG releases the session and requests the TrGW to release the bindings established for the session. The Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF) can screen SIP requests and responses based on local policy.

Regarding SDP offer/answer changes in connection data, the IMS-ALG/TrGW handles four scenarios: adding IP addresses or port numbers, deleting them, reassigning them, or making no changes. For IP version interworking, the IMS-ALG adjusts SDP b=AS bandwidth modifiers and may support enhanced bandwidth negotiation using the 'a=bw-info' SDP attribute. If the 'a=bw-info' attribute lines do not contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and IPv6, the IMS-ALG recalculates the bandwidth properties and includes the IP version used for the recalculation, along with the maximum and minimum packet rates assumed. If the SDP body contains bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and IPv6 and the IMS-ALG does not support transcoding, it forwards the SDP body with unmodified 'a=bw-info' attribute lines.","The answer must include the following details: 
  - The role of IMS-ALG as a SIP B2BUA and its behavior in forwarding SIP messages.
  - Specific SDP modifications performed by IMS-ALG as per subclauses 9.1.1, 9.1.3, 9.1.5, and clause 10.

Describe the interleaving process for MCS-1 UL and explain how it applies to other MCS types.,"The interleaving process for MCS-1 UL involves combining the header and data into one entity according to specific rules. The coded bits c(n,k) are defined as follows: for k = 0 to 79, c(k) = hc(k); for k = 80 to 451, c(k) = dc(k-80). The interleaved bits c’(n,k) are then determined by shifting the coded bits: for k = 0 to 24, c’(n,k) = c(n,k); for k = 26 to 81, c’(n,k) = c(n,k-1); for k = 83 to 138, c’(n,k) = c(n,k-2); for k = 140 to 423, c’(n,k) = c(n,k-3); for k = 425 to 455, c’(n,k) = c(n,k-4). Additionally, four extra stealing flags q(8), q(9), q(10), and q(11) are set to 0. The resulting block is interleaved using the formula: i(B,j) = c’(n,k) for k = 0 to 455, where n = 0 to N+1, B = B0 + 4n + (k mod 4), and j = 2((49k) mod 57) + ((k mod 8) div 4).

This interleaving process for MCS-1 UL is also applicable to other MCS types, specifically MCS-2 UL, MCS-3 UL, and MCS-4 UL, as confirmed by their respective subclauses in TS 45.003. Each of these subclauses states that the interleaving process for MCS-1 UL should be used for their respective MCS types.","The answer should include the detailed interleaving process for MCS-1 UL as specified in TS 45.003 5.1.5.2.4, including the rules for combining header and data, coding bits, stealing flags, and the interleaving formula. It should also mention that this interleaving process is applicable to MCS-2 UL, MCS-3 UL, and MCS-4 UL as confirmed by the respective subclauses in TS 45.003."
"Describe the procedures and requirements for PS-CS SRVCC and vSRVCC access transfer as specified in TS 24.237, and explain the message structure consistency rules in TS 24.007.","The procedures and requirements for PS-CS SRVCC (Packet-Switched to Circuit-Switched Single Radio Voice Call Continuity) and vSRVCC (Video Single Radio Voice Call Continuity) access transfer are detailed in TS 24.237. These procedures involve the SC UE (Service Continuity User Equipment), the SCC AS (Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server), the EATF (Enhanced Access Transfer Function), the MSC server enhanced for ICS (IP Multimedia Subsystem Centralized Services), the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC, and the ATCF (Access Transfer Control Function).

For SC UE or SCC AS not supporting ICS procedures, PS-CS SRVCC access transfer enables the transfer of:
- A single session with an active speech media component.
- Up to one session with an active speech media component and up to one session with an inactive speech media component when the MSC Server assisted mid-call feature is supported.

For SC UE or SCC AS, PS-CS access transfer in vSRVCC enables the transfer of a single session with active speech and video media components.

To fulfill the requirements for PS to CS SRVCC for calls in the alerting phase or vSRVCC access transfer for calls in the alerting phase, the SC UE needs to be:
- Engaged in a session with a speech media component in the early dialog state before PS to CS SRVCC access transfer is performed.
- Engaged in a session with active speech and video media components in the early dialog state before vSRVCC access transfer is performed.

The following conditions must be met:
- A SIP 180 (Ringing) response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session has been sent or received.
- A SIP final response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session has not been sent or received.

After successful completion of the PS to CS SRVCC procedures:
- Subclauses 12.2.2, 12.2.3, 12.2.3A, and 12.2.4 should be followed for an SC UE engaged in one or more ongoing sessions.
- Subclauses 12.2.3B and 12.2.4 should be followed for an SC UE engaged in a session in the early dialog state.

After successful completion of the vSRVCC procedures:
- Subclauses 12.2A.2, 12.2A.3, 12.2A.4, and 12.2A.6 should be followed for an SC UE engaged in one or more ongoing sessions.
- Subclauses 12.2A.5 and 12.2A.6 should be followed for an SC UE engaged in a session in the early dialog state.

Regarding message structure consistency rules in TS 24.007, it is noted that in some protocols, the structure of part or all of the messages might not always follow the standard Layer 3 (L3) message structure. As a design rule, this should be consistent for a given protocol, direction, and lower layer Service Access Point (SAP). A possibility is to describe the message with the compact notation described in Annex B. A few consistent structures are found in the present protocol specifications and are described therein.

What are the procedures and interworking mechanisms for handling Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU) service requests and responses in the MSC Server?,"The procedures and interworking mechanisms for handling Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU) service requests and responses in the MSC Server involve several steps and considerations, as specified in the relevant documents.

1. **Erasure of CFU Service**:
   - When a CFU service erasure request is successful, the network will erase and deactivate the CFU service. The network then sends a return result indicating acceptance of the request. This result includes the BasicServiceCode for which CFU was erased and may also contain an SS-Status parameter. If the SS-Status is included, it reflects the state of the service, although the mobile station (MS) should ignore its contents. If the request did not include a BasicServiceCode and the erasure was successful for all basic services, the network may send an empty return result to the MS. If the network cannot accept the erasure request, the CFU status remains unchanged, and an error indication is returned to the MS.

2. **Handling CFU Registration Requests**:
   - When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with a RegisterSS invoke operation for CFU, it includes a Communication Diversion document in the HTTP PUT request. The MSC Server sets the active attribute to ","Key details the answer must include:

"What are the primary level settings and test tolerances for Inter frequency RSTD tests as defined in TS 37.571, including the response time calculation and the rate of correct events?","The primary level settings for Inter frequency RSTD tests as defined in TS 37.571 include specific parameters for different test scenarios. Table 9.6.3.5-1 defines the cell-specific test parameters for T1 and T6, while Table 9.6.3.5-2 defines the parameters for T2 to T5. The response time, including test tolerance, is calculated to be 78.3 seconds. This response time is derived from the LPP time IE value, which is the sum of the maximum allowed RSTD reporting delay (67.16 seconds), T2, T3, and an additional 150 ms, resulting in a rounded value of 78 seconds.

The maximum allowed RSTD reporting delay is measured from the beginning of time interval T4 to the moment the UE starts sending preambles on the PRACH for the positioning measurement report message to nCell1. This delay is the sum of TRSTD_inter_NB-IoT-EC and TRandomAccess_NB-IoT-EC. The RSTD measurement time TRSTD_inter_NB-IoT-EC is derived according to section 9.6.3.3, giving a total measurement time of 11.52 seconds for nCell 2 and nCell 3 with respect to the reference nCell 1.

The random access delay TRandomAccess_NB-IoT-EC is calculated as the sum of Tevaluate_NB_inter_NB-IoT-EC (12800 ms), TSI (41560 ms), and TPRACH_NB-IoT (1280 ms), resulting in a total delay of 55.64 seconds.

Test tolerances are defined in clauses C.1.3 and C4. The rate of correct events for each neighbor cell observed during repeated tests must be at least 90% with a confidence level of 95%. The reported RSTD measurement for each correct event must fall within the RSTD reporting range specified in Clause 9.1.10.3, which is between RSTD_0000 and RSTD_12711.","The answer should include the primary level settings for Inter frequency RSTD tests, the calculation of response time including test tolerance, the components of the maximum allowed RSTD reporting delay, the RSTD measurement time, the random access delay, the defined test tolerances, and the required rate of correct events with confidence level."
Explain the process and requirements for including addresses and identifiers in SIP requests and responses for charging events as per 3GPP specifications.,"According to 3GPP specifications, the process and requirements for including addresses and identifiers in SIP requests and responses for charging events are as follows:

1. **IMS Network Elements (NEs)**: Based on operator policy, each IMS NE for which the Charging Trigger Function (CTF) is generating charging events must include its own address or specific NE identifier in the initial SIP request sent out within the trust domain. The final SIP response sent back by the last element of the trust domain must contain the list of addresses and identifiers received within the initial SIP request. This list of addresses or identifiers received in the final response must be included in the charging event generated by the CTF.

2. **Applications**: Similarly, for each application for which the hosting Application Server (AS) CTF is generating charging events, the address or identifier of the AS and its application identifier must be included in the initial SIP request sent out within the trust domain. The final SIP response sent back by the last element of the trust domain must contain the list of addresses and application identifiers received within the initial SIP request. This list of addresses or identifiers and application identifiers received in the final response must be included in the charging event generated by the CTF.

3. **FE Identifier List**: The FE Identifier List contains one or more IM CN subsystem functional entity addresses and/or AS addresses with corresponding application identifiers. As defined in the specifications, the functional entity address is included when the IM CN subsystem functional entity creates charging information for the related Call Detail Record (CDR) of this IM CN subsystem functional entity. For AS hosting several applications, the same AS address can appear multiple times, each accompanied by a different application identifier based on the application executed by the AS. Values in SIP requests are to be ignored, and the FE-Identifier header exchange via SIP signaling is defined in the relevant 3GPP document.

These requirements ensure that all necessary addresses and identifiers are accurately included in SIP requests and responses, facilitating the correct generation of charging events and the creation of comprehensive charging information for related CDRs.","The answer should cover the following key points:
  - The necessity for IMS NEs to include their addresses or specific NE identifiers in the initial SIP request and the final SIP response to contain these details.
  - The requirement for applications to include their addresses or identifiers and application identifiers in the initial SIP request and the final SIP response to contain these details.
  - The composition of the FE Identifier List, including IM CN subsystem functional entity addresses and AS addresses with application identifiers.
  - The relevance of these requirements to the generation of charging events and the creation of charging information for related CDRs."
What are the key requirements for repeaters co-located with base stations of different systems?,"The key requirements for repeaters co-located with base stations of different systems include several specific compliance tests and conditions. Firstly, manufacturers must declare whether the repeater is intended to operate co-located with base stations of systems such as GSM850, GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, and/or E-UTRA operating in another frequency band. If this is the case, compliance with the applicable test requirements for spurious emissions (clause 9.2.5.4) and input intermodulation (clause 11.5.2) must be tested.

For intermodulation performance, the requirements should be met when specific signals are applied to the repeater. However, these requirements do not apply when the repeater's pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the co-location requirement. In such cases, site-engineering solutions may be used, as addressed in TR 25.942.

Regarding spurious emissions, the power of any spurious emission must not exceed the limits specified in Table 9.2.5.4-1 for an E-UTRA FDD repeater co-located with base stations. These requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and apply to both uplink and downlink at maximum gain. Specific limits for the uplink direction of repeaters are based on coupling loss with UTRA TDD BS receivers, with requirements of -53dBm/100kHz and -83dBm/100kHz reflecting what can be achieved with current technology. These limits may be reconsidered as technology progresses.

Additionally, the requirements assume that two operating bands with overlapping frequency ranges are not deployed in the same geographical area. If overlapping frequency arrangements are deployed, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the current specifications.","The answer should include the declaration requirement for co-location with various base station systems, the specific compliance tests for spurious emissions and input intermodulation, the conditions under which intermodulation requirements do not apply, the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA FDD repeaters, and the specific limits for uplink direction based on coupling loss with UTRA TDD BS receivers. It should also mention the assumptions and conditions under which these requirements are set, and the potential for future reassessment based on technological advancements."
"Describe the procedures and configurations required for the 5GMS AS to obtain its data collection and reporting client configuration from the Data Collection AF, including the differences based on trust domains and the necessary service operations and parameters.","The 5GMS AS (Application Server) must follow specific procedures to obtain its data collection and reporting client configuration from the Data Collection AF (Application Function) based on whether the 5GMS AS and 5GMS AF reside in the same or different trust domains.

1. **Same Trust Domain**: 
   - If both the 5GMS AS and the 5GMS AF reside in the trusted domain, the 5GMS AS shall obtain its data collection client configuration directly from the Data Collection AF. This is done by invoking the appropriate Ndcaf_DataReporting service operations as specified in clause 7.2 of TS 26.532 according to the procedures outlined in clause 4.2.5 of TS 26.532.

2. **Different Trust Domains**: 
   - If the 5GMS AS and the 5GMS AF reside in different trust domains, the 5GMS AS shall obtain its configuration indirectly via the NEF (Network Exposure Function). This involves invoking the equivalent operations on the Nnef_DataReporting service as defined in TS 26.531.

In both scenarios, the 5GMS AS must declare that it supports the MS_ACCESS_ACTIVITY data reporting domain in DataReportingSession.supportedDomains. The Data Collection AF instantiated in the 5GMS AF will request reporting for this domain by including the same value as a key to the DataReportingSession.reportingConditions dictionary. The value of the ReportingCondition.type property at this key shall be INTERVAL, THRESHOLD, or OFF.

Describe the GAN Registration procedure and the Keep Alive process as defined in 3GPP TS 43.318.,"The GAN Registration procedure involves several steps to ensure that a Mobile Station (MS) is properly registered with the appropriate Generic Access Network Controller (GANC). Initially, the MS establishes a secure tunnel with the secure gateway of the Default GANC provided during the Discovery procedure. The MS then attempts to register with the Default GANC, which may accept the registration, reject it, or redirect the MS to a different Serving GANC based on information provided during registration, operator policy, or network load balancing.

During the registration attempt, the MS provides various details such as the current camping cell ID, the last location area identifier (LAI) or tracking area identifier (TAI) where it successfully registered, its IMSI, and the GAN services required. The GANC uses this information to determine the appropriate registration context and operating parameters for the MS, including the GAN mode (A/Gb or Iu) to use for the session.

The registration procedure involves several steps:
1. If the MS has the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the Default or Serving SEGW, it performs a DNS query to resolve the FQDN to an IP address. If an IP address is already provisioned, the DNS step is omitted.
2. The DNS server returns a response.
3. The MS sets up a secure IPsec tunnel to the SEGW, which may be reused from an earlier Discovery or Registration.
4. If the MS has the FQDN of the Default or Serving GANC, it performs a DNS query to resolve the FQDN to an IP address. If an IP address is already provisioned, the DNS step is omitted.
5. The DNS server returns a response.
6. The MS sets up a TCP connection to a TCP port on the GANC and attempts to register by transmitting the GA-RC REGISTER REQUEST message, which includes various details such as the current camping cell ID, IMSI, and GAN services required.
7. If the GANC accepts the registration, it responds with a GA-RC REGISTER ACCEPT message containing GAN-specific system information and operating parameters. The TCP connection and secure IPsec tunnel are maintained as long as the MS is registered to this GANC.
8. If the GANC rejects the registration, it responds with a GA-RC REGISTER REJECT message indicating the reject cause, and the TCP connection and secure IPsec tunnel are released.
9. If the GANC redirects the MS to another Serving GANC, it responds with a GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message providing the FQDN or IP address of the target Serving GANC and the associated SEGW. The TCP connection is released, and the secure IPsec tunnel may be optionally released.

The Keep Alive process is a mechanism to ensure that the MS remains registered to the GANC. It involves periodic transmissions of the GA-RC KEEP ALIVE message from the MS to the GANC. This process helps the MS determine that the GANC is still available using the currently established lower layer connection.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the secure tunnel establishment with the Default GANC.
  - Description of the registration attempt and its possible outcomes (accept, reject, redirect).
  - Detailed information provided by MS during registration (e.g., cell ID, IMSI, GAN services required).

"Describe the procedure for handling a SETUP message with a Repeat Indicator set to 'support of service change and fallback' in a 3GPP network, including the roles of the MSC, VLR, and UE, and the possible outcomes and actions based on the network's response.","When a UE sends a SETUP message with a Repeat Indicator set to 'support of service change and fallback', along with multimedia and speech Bearer Capability Information Elements (BC-IEs), it requests the network to establish a call with the capability to fallback to either a speech-only or multimedia-only call, or to use service change later during the active state of the call. The first BC-IE indicates the preferred service.

The MSC first checks the provisioning and verifies if the requested functionality is supported. If supported, the MSC replies with a CALL PROCEEDING message, which can include both BC-IEs in the same order to indicate acceptance of the proposed settings, or a single BC-IE (either multimedia or speech). If the CALL PROCEEDING message is delayed until the response from the terminating user, it may also be sent with the BC-IEs in reverse order.

If the MSC does not support the Repeat Indicator value, it sends a STATUS message back to the UE with the Cause Value set to #100, 'Conditional IE error'. The UE then reacts by either resending a new SETUP message with a single BC-IE or performing any appropriate action according to its implementation. Alternatively, the MSC may return a RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The VLR plays a role in checking the subscription for the basic services indicated by the MSC. For mobile-originated SCUDIF calls, the MSC converts both PLMN bearer capabilities to individual Basic Service codes and sends them to the VLR. The VLR checks the subscription and indicates the availability of each service to the MSC. If both services are not provisioned, the VLR sends a negative response, and the MSC falls back to the allowed service if only one service is available.

During the negotiation process, if the preferred mode indicated by the originating UE is selected, the call is set up normally. If the negotiation results in a change of the selected mode, such as switching from multimedia to speech, an In-Call Modification procedure is initiated after the call control entity enters the active state.

In the case of receiving a STATUS message with cause #100 due to the Repeat Indicator, the UE may resend a new SETUP message with a single BC-IE, and the network may resend a new SETUP message with either the preferred service BC-IE or the speech BC-IE, depending on the configuration.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
  - The initial SETUP message sent by the UE, including the Repeat Indicator and BC-IEs.
  - The MSC's role in checking provisioning and responding with CALL PROCEEDING or STATUS messages.
  - The VLR's role in checking subscription and indicating service availability.
  - The negotiation process for selecting the preferred mode and the potential initiation of the In-Call Modification procedure.

Describe the handling and significance of Load Control Information (LCI) in PFCP messages as per 3GPP TS 29.244 specifications.,"The Load Control Information (LCI) IE is a crucial element in PFCP messages, as defined by the 3GPP TS 29.244 specifications. When a UP function provides load control information, it must include the full set of load control information, even if only a subset has changed. This ensures that the receiver has a complete and accurate picture of the node's load status. The Load Control Sequence Number is incremented whenever the load control information is modified, allowing the receiver to determine the most recent information and overwrite any stored data from the same peer node if the new information is more recent.

The LCI IE parameters are categorized into non-critical and critical optional parameters. Non-critical optional parameters can be included without knowing the receiver's capability to support them, as the receiver can ignore these parameters and still comprehend the load control information. Critical optional parameters, however, should only be included if the sender knows the receiver supports them, either through signaling methods or configuration.

The Load Control Sequence Number plays a vital role in differentiating instances of LCI IEs generated at different times by the same UP function. It helps the receiver collate out-of-order load control information and determine if the newly received information has changed compared to previously received data. The sequence number is incremented only when the load control information is modified, and the receiver updates its stored information only if the new sequence number is higher than the stored value. In cases of sequence number roll-over or node restart, the receiver must be prepared to process a sequence number that is less than the previous value.

The Load Metric parameter indicates the current load level of the originating node, represented as a percentage from 0 to 100. It reflects various aspects such as memory and CPU usage. The sender should avoid advertising every small variation in the Load Metric, as minor changes do not significantly impact the node selection logic at the receiver. Instead, larger variations, typically 5 or more units, should be considered reasonable for advertising new load control information.

Overall, the handling of LCI in PFCP messages ensures efficient load management and accurate node selection, contributing to the optimal performance of the network.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the Load Control Information (LCI) IE and its inclusion in PFCP messages.
  - Requirement for the UP function to include the full set of load control information and increment the Load Control Sequence Number upon changes.

  - Categorization of parameters within LCI IE (non-critical and critical optional parameters) and conditions for their inclusion.
  - Detailed description of the Load Control Sequence Number, its role in differentiating instances, and handling out-of-order information.

"Describe the procedures and conditions under which the SNRM-C sends various reports related to MBMS listening status and location information, as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.548 and TS 24.545 documents.","The SNRM-C sends various reports related to MBMS listening status and location information under specific conditions and procedures outlined in the 3GPP TS 24.548 and TS 24.545 documents.

1. **Conditions for Sending MBMS Listening Status Reports:**
   - If the VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1, and no additional MBMS bearers that the SNRM-C is interested in are active in the current cell, the SNRM-C sends an MBMS listening status report with information related to TMGI 1.
   - If the VAL UE moves into a new cell where both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active, the SNRM-C sends a location information report.
   - If the SNRM-C receives TMGI 1 and TMGI 2, it sends an MBMS listening status report with information related to both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2.
   - If the VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active, the SNRM-C sends an MBMS listening status report with information related to TMGI 2.

2. **Criteria for Determining MBMS Bearer Quality:**
   - The SNRM-C determines the MBMS bearer quality using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation considers reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). Predictive methods may also be used to estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality.
   - The threshold for MBMS bearer quality depends on the VAL service type and the metrics used, which are out of scope of the specification.

"Describe the procedures and modifications for the Call Deflection service as specified in 3GPP TS 23.231, including the relevant clauses and scenarios for MGW bypass.","The Call Deflection service procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.231 require adherence to the guidelines outlined in 3GPP TS 23.205 clause 13.2, with several modifications. Firstly, the call establishment and call clearing procedures defined in clauses 6 and 7 must be applied. Additionally, the procedures for providing in-band information as defined in clause 14.6 are to be followed.

Optimized or deferred MGW selection may be applied for establishing the bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber, as specified in clauses 4.4.2 and 4.4.3. If there is no need for the (G)MSC server to manipulate the bearer, MGW bypass can be applied as specified in clause 4.4.5. This means that in call scenarios where the GMSC or Intermediate Node server does not need to manipulate the bearer, the GMSC or Intermediate Node may perform call control signaling without inserting an MGW in the bearer path during call establishment. In such cases, the bearer-related information of SDP offers/answers is passed transparently through the (G)MSC Server.

However, scenarios requiring bearer manipulation, such as insertion of tones or announcements, lawful interception, and CAMEL services, do not allow this optimization. MGW removal and re-insertion scenarios once the call is answered are not supported.

Figures 4.4.5.1 and 4.4.5.2 provide examples of network models and message sequence charts for mobile terminating calls with MGW bypass. The option to support MGW bypass relies on external user plane interworking at the succeeding MGW, and the GMSC Server signaling to and from the succeeding 3GPP PLMN node must comply with the SIP-I on Nc specification.

Additionally, the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.072 for the Call Deflection supplementary service must be followed, with additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network as described in clause 13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.205.","The answer must include the procedures for call establishment and clearing, in-band information provision, and optimized or deferred MGW selection.

Describe the process and requirements for UE measurement filtering and reporting in NR sidelink communication as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331.,"The process and requirements for UE measurement filtering and reporting in NR sidelink communication as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 involve several key steps and parameters:

1. **Filtering Measured Results**: The UE filters the measured results using the formula:
   \[
   Fn = (1 – a) \cdot Fn-1 + a \cdot Mn
   \]
   where:
   - \( Mn \) is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer.
   - \( Fn \) is the updated filtered measurement result used for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting, or U2N Relay (re)selection evaluation.
   - \( Fn-1 \) is the old filtered measurement result, with \( F0 \) set to \( M1 \) when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received.
   - \( a \) is the filterCoefficient, which varies based on the type of measurement.

2. **Adaptation of the Filter**: The filter is adapted to preserve its time characteristics at different input rates. The filterCoefficient \( k \) assumes a sample rate equal to \( X \) ms, which is equivalent to one intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133, assuming non-DRX operation. The value of \( X \) depends on the frequency range.

3. **Notes on Filtering**:
   - If \( k \) is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
   - Filtering is performed in the same domain used for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting, or U2N Relay (re)selection evaluation (logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements).
   - The filter input rate is implementation-dependent to fulfill the performance requirements set in TS 38.133.
   - For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to reset filtering upon BWP switch.

4. **NR Sidelink Measurement Results**: The UE derives NR sidelink measurement results by measuring one or multiple DMRS associated per PC5-RRC connection as configured by the peer UE. For all NR sidelink measurement results, the UE applies layer 3 filtering as specified in clause 5.5.3.2 before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria and measurement reporting. In this release, only NR sidelink RSRP can be configured as trigger quantity and reporting quantity.

5. **Evaluation of Reporting Criteria**: The UE performs the evaluation of reporting criteria for NR sidelink measurements as specified in clause 5.8.10.4.

These steps ensure accurate and consistent measurement reporting and evaluation in NR sidelink communication.","The answer must include:
  - The formula for filtering measured results and the definitions of Mn, Fn, Fn-1, and the filterCoefficient.

"Describe the process and requirements for temporary group formation within a VAL system, including the notification flow and API operations involved.","The process of temporary group formation within a VAL system involves several pre-conditions and steps, as well as specific notification flows and API operations. 

Pre-conditions:
1. The group management client, group management server, VAL server, and VAL group members must belong to the same VAL system.
2. The group management client must have retrieved the group configurations of the groups.
3. The VAL server must have subscribed to receive group management event notifications.

Step-by-step process:
1. The group management client of the VAL user requests a temporary group formation operation to the group management server, including the identities of the groups being combined. The client may also indicate the required security and priority levels for the temporary group.
2. The group management server checks if the operation is performed by an authorized VAL user based on group policy and verifies that neither group1 nor group2 is a temporary group. If either is a temporary group, the regrouping is rejected.
3. The group management server creates and stores the information of the temporary group, including the temporary VAL group ID, the VAL group IDs of the groups being combined, and the priority and security levels. If the VAL service types of the groups are not identical, the server determines the overlapping part and stores the VAL service list for the temporary group.
4. The group management server notifies the VAL server about the temporary group creation, including the temporary VAL group ID and the VAL group IDs of the constituent groups. If a VAL service list is included, the VAL server stores it and provides the VAL service types accordingly.
5. The group management server sends temporary group formation notification messages to the VAL group members of the constituent groups.
6. The VAL group members send individual temporary group formation notification response messages.
7. The group management server provides a temporary group formation response to the group management client of the authorized VAL user. If a VAL service list is included, the client stores it and initiates the VAL service types accordingly.
8. The VAL group members individually request group configuration data from the group management server for the temporary group, which includes security, priority, and other parameters.

Notification flow:
The information flow for notifying the VAL server about the temporary group formation is described in Table 10.3.2.40-1. The group management server sends the notification to the VAL server, which includes the details of the temporary group and the constituent groups.

API operation:
The API operation Notify_TempGroupFormation is used for the notification of the new temporary group formed at the group management server. The known consumer of this API operation is the VAL server.

Describe the coding and significance of various bucket-related information elements in 3GPP TS 48.018.,"The 3GPP TS 48.018 specification outlines several bucket-related information elements, each with specific coding and significance:

1. **Default Bucket Size (Bmax) for an MS**: This element indicates the default bucket size in octets for a Mobile Station (MS). It is coded as per Table 11.3.2 and is referenced in sub-clause 11.3.5.

2. **Maximum Bucket Size (Bmax) for a BVC**: This element specifies the maximum bucket size in octets for a BVC (Base Station Controller Virtual Connection). The coding varies based on whether the Gigabit Interface feature has been negotiated. If not negotiated, the Bmax field is encoded in 100 octet increments, ranging from 0 x 100 octets to 65,535 x 100 octets (6 Mbytes). If negotiated, the Bmax field is encoded according to the Flow Control Granularity IE, as detailed in Table 11.3.5.

3. **Leak Rate (R) for a Flow Control Bucket**: This element indicates the leak rate to be applied to a flow control bucket. Similar to Bmax, the coding depends on the negotiation of the Gigabit Interface feature. Without negotiation, the R field is encoded in 100 bits/s increments, ranging from 0 x 100 bits/s to 65,535 x 100 bits/s (6 Mbps). With negotiation, the R field is encoded according to the Flow Control Granularity IE, as described in Table 11.3.4.

"Describe the procedures and requirements for LPP message transactions, including message types, sequence numbers, and segmentation.","LPP (LTE Positioning Protocol) message transactions involve the exchange of one or more LPP messages between the location server and the target device. Each LPP message consists of a set of common fields followed by a body, which may contain information specific to a particular message type. The common fields include the Transaction ID and Transaction End fields, which conform to specific procedures and are independent of the transport method used for LPP messages.

The defined message types for LPP transactions are:
- Request Capabilities
- Provide Capabilities
- Request Assistance Data
- Provide Assistance Data
- Request Location Information
- Provide Location Information
- Abort
- Error

For each location session, a sender must include a sequence number in all LPP messages. The sequence number must be distinct for different LPP messages sent in the same direction within the same session. Sequence numbers used in the uplink and downlink are independent. The receiver records the most recent sequence number for each session and discards any message with a duplicate sequence number. Sequence numbers are deleted in the server when the session is terminated and in the target device after 10 minutes of inactivity.

LPP message segmentation allows a large message body to be sent in several shorter messages. When segmenting, the sender includes the IE SegmentationInfo in each segment and indicates if more messages are on the way. The receiver may store these segments and processes them once the final segment is received, indicating that no more messages are on the way. Reliable transport rules and common field settings apply to each individual segment independently.

In summary, LPP message transactions require adherence to specific procedures for message types, sequence numbers, and segmentation to ensure reliable and orderly communication between the location server and the target device.","The answer must include the structure and types of LPP messages, the use and management of sequence numbers, the procedure for segmenting LPP messages, and how segmented messages are processed.

This includes interactions with SIP/SDP signalling of the IMS when the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service is used by the P-CSCF, and both the PCF and the P-CSCF support the 'IMS_SBI' feature. Additionally, the P-CSCF may use the Rx reference point with the PCF.
   - In PLMNs or SNPNs where both Rx and Npcf_PolicyAuthorization are used, it is implementation-specific how the P-CSCF determines the applicable interface/protocol to use with the PCF. This could involve separate P-CSCFs for Rx and Npcf_PolicyAuthorization or local routing configuration in the P-CSCF.
   - For this release, only IMS voice and emergency services are provided for SNPN.

2. **Procedure for AF/NEF Requesting PCF to Delete AF Application Session Context**:
   - This procedure is performed when the AF/NEF requests the PCF to delete the AF application session context. The NEF acts as an AF to support network exposure functionality for policy/charging capability.
   - The AF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the 'Individual Application Session Context' resource to request the removal of the AF application session. This request may include events to subscribe to.
   - The PCF identifies the affected PDU Session where PCC rules related to this AF session are installed and removes these PCC rules.
   - The PCF then removes the AF application session context and sends an HTTP '204 No Content' or '200 OK' response to the AF. If the request includes events to subscribe to, the PCF sends the corresponding information in the response.
   - The PCF interacts with the SMF according to the defined procedures.

3. **Procedure for PCF Modifying Policy Decisions for a PDU Session**:
   - This procedure is performed when the PCF decides to modify policy decisions for a PDU session. The PCF receives an internal or external trigger to re-evaluate PCC Rules and policy decisions for a PDU session.
   - Possible external triggers include notifications from the UDR about policy data changes or application data changes, and spending limit reports from the CHF.
   - The PCF makes a policy decision and determines if updated or new policy information needs to be sent to the SMF.
   - If network slice data rate related policy control applies, the PCF may update the Remaining Maximum Slice Data Rate information by invoking the Nudr_DataRepository_Update service operation.
   - The PCF notifies the SMF of the updated policies by sending an HTTP POST request with the updated policies to the SMF.
   - The SMF responds with an HTTP '200 OK' or '204 No Content' to the PCF.

These procedures ensure that IMS services and policy control are effectively managed and updated in accordance with the defined standards.","The answer should cover the following key details: 
  - The signalling flows for IMS services, including interactions with SIP/SDP signalling and the use of Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service and Rx reference point.
  - The procedure for AF/NEF requesting PCF to delete AF application session context, including the steps involved in session termination and interaction with SMF.
  - The procedure for PCF modifying policy decisions for a PDU session, including triggers for policy decision modification, interaction with CHF, and steps involved in policy decision and notification to SMF."
"Describe the process and requirements for creating a new subscription to provision 5G LAN related parameters and a VAL group, including the necessary HTTP POST requests, authorization checks, and data structures involved.","To create a new subscription to provision 5G LAN related parameters, the Application Function (AF) must initiate an HTTP POST request to the Network Exposure Function (NEF) for the '5GLAN Parameters Provision Subscriptions' resource. The body of this HTTP POST message should include the 5G LAN service related parameters within the '5gLanParams' attribute. Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the NEF will verify if the AF is authorized to provision these parameters. If authorized, the NEF will interact with the Unified Data Management (UDM) using the Nudm_ParameterProvision service to create a subscription at the UDM. If the UDM accepts the request and responds successfully, the NEF will create a new subscription and assign a subscription identifier for the 'Individual 5GLAN Parameters Provision Subscription' resource. The NEF will then send an HTTP '201 Created' response, including the 5GLanParametersProvision data structure in the response body and a Location header field containing the URI of the created individual subscription resource.

For creating a VAL group, the VAL server must send an HTTP POST message to the group management server. The body of this POST message should include VAL group document information as specified. The group management server will first verify the identity of the VAL server and check if it is authorized to create the VAL group document. If the VAL group document includes location criteria, the server will obtain a list of VAL users or VAL User Equipment (UEs) within the requested location criteria from the Location Management server and include them in the VAL group members of the new VAL group. If the VAL group document includes 5G LAN-Type communication, the server will invoke the 5GLANParameterProvision API towards the NEF via an HTTP POST message. If the VAL server is authorized to create the VAL group document, the group management server will create a new resource and return the VAL group document and its Resource URI in the response message.

Both processes involve specific data structures and response codes. The POST method supports URI query parameters, request data structures, and response data structures as specified. The response to a successful creation request will include a '201 Created' status code, appropriate data structures, and headers.","Key details the answer must include:

Describe the requirements and conditions for measuring the absolute accuracy of RSRP as defined in 3GPP TS 36.521 and the reference sensitivity power level as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101.,"The absolute accuracy of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) is defined as the RSRP measured from a cell that has a different carrier frequency from the serving cell. The accuracy requirements are valid under specific conditions: cell-specific reference signals must be transmitted from one, two, or four antenna ports, conditions defined in 3GPP TS 36.101 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity must be fulfilled, and RSRP must be measured according to clause I.3.3 for the corresponding band. The reporting range of RSRP is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with 1 dB resolution, and the mapping of the measured quantity is detailed in Table 9.1.5.1.3-2. The normative references for these requirements are found in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 9.1.3.1, clause 9.1.4, and A.9.1.5.

The reference sensitivity power level (REFSENS) is the minimum mean power applied to each UE antenna port for all UE categories except category 0, category M1, category M2, and category 1bis, or to the single antenna port for UE category 0, UE category M1, category M2, and UE category 1bis, at which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.

What are the mandatory requirements and functionalities of UE test loop mode E for 5GS UEs supporting NR sidelink as specified in TS 38.509?,"UE test loop mode E is mandatory for all 5GS UEs supporting NR sidelink. This mode provides functionalities for both transmit and receive operations of SDAP SDUs for PC5 QoS Flows while the UE is operating in NR sidelink. For communication receive operation, UE test loop mode E counts successfully received STCH PDCP SDUs, PSCCH PHY transport blocks, and PSSCH PHY transport blocks. For communication transmit operation, it triggers the transmission of NR sidelink communication packets, utilizing AT commands and requiring an appropriate physical interface in V2X out-of-coverage scenarios. Functional block diagrams illustrate the UE test loop function for different operational cases: intra-frequency or inter-frequency concurrent operation and PC5-only operation, with separate diagrams for communication receive and transmit indications. The operation of UE test loop mode E is similar to that described in TS 36.509, subclause 5.4.4c, with specific exceptions where V2X references apply to NR sidelink and subclause 5.4.4c.1 is replaced by subclause 5.3.4.3.1 in the current specification.","The answer should include the mandatory requirement for UE test loop mode E in 5GS UEs supporting NR sidelink, the functionalities provided for both transmit and receive operations, the counting mechanism for received SDUs and transport blocks, the trigger mechanism for transmission in V2X out-of-coverage scenarios, and a brief description of the functional block diagrams for different operational cases.

Describe the process and parameters involved in estimating the noise floor and inverse filtering levels in the SBR frame.,"The process of estimating the noise floor and inverse filtering levels in the SBR frame involves several steps and parameters. The HF generator in the decoder plays a crucial role in this process. Apart from the spectral envelope, additional parameters are assessed to achieve optimal results. The noise floor is defined as the ratio between the energy of the noise that should be added to a particular frequency band to obtain a similar tonal to noise ratio as the original signal, and the energy of the HF generated signal for that frequency band. The noise floor is estimated once or twice per SBR frame, depending on the number of spectral envelopes estimated for the frame. The frequency resolution for the noise floor scalefactor is calculated using the same algorithm as in the decoder. The start and stop time borders of the different noise floors are determined by the time grid.

The level of inverse filtering applied in the decoder is estimated for different frequency ranges with the same frequency resolution as used for the noise floor scalefactor estimation. The estimation algorithm compares the tonality of the original signal with the tonality that will be achieved after the HF generator in the decoder. The ratio between the two is mapped to four different inverse filtering levels: off, low, mid, and high. These levels correspond to different chirp factors in the HF generator. Additionally, the encoder detects where a strong tonal component will be missing after the HF generation in the decoder. This detection is performed at the highest frequency resolution provided by the high frequency resolution table, fTableHigh. The level of the tonal component is implicitly coded by the SBR envelope and the noise floor scalefactors, so only the frequency needs to be coded.","Key details the answer must include:
  - Explanation of the HF generator's role in the decoder.

"Describe the optimizations and functionalities of Cellular IoT (CIoT) in 5GS as outlined in the 3GPP TS 23.501 specifications, including the roles of Control Plane and User Plane optimizations, and the registration process for UE capabilities.","Cellular Internet-of-Things (CIoT) in 5GS is designed to optimize and enhance the functionality of IoT devices within cellular networks. The optimizations and functionalities are detailed in the 3GPP TS 23.501 specifications and can be categorized into Control Plane and User Plane optimizations.

Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimizations focus on the signaling aspects and are supported over E-UTRA. These optimizations are not supported over Non-3GPP RAT type accesses. The functionalities provided by Control Plane CIoT include efficient handling of signaling messages and subscriber data, which are crucial for IoT devices that typically generate small amounts of data but require frequent signaling.

User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimizations enable the transfer of user plane data from CM-IDLE without the need for using the Service Request procedure to establish Access Stratum (AS) context in NG-RAN and UE. Preconditions for these optimizations include the negotiation of support between UE and AMF, indication of support in UE radio capabilities, and establishment of at least one PDU session with active UP connection. Key procedures involved are Connection Suspend and Connection Resume, which allow the UE to store and resume AS information, facilitating efficient data transfer and mobility across different NG-RAN nodes.

The registration process for UE capabilities involves the UE signaling its 5G Preferred Network Behaviour, which includes support for Control Plane and User Plane CIoT optimizations, N3 data transfer, and header compression. The AMF then indicates the network's accepted behavior in the 5G Supported Network Behaviour information. This interaction ensures that both the UE and the network are aligned on the supported optimizations, influencing policy decisions and potentially causing rerouting of the Registration Request.

Historically, CIoT was referred to as Machine Type Communication (MTC) in earlier 3GPP releases. The functionalities added to support CIoT have general applicability and are not constrained to specific scenarios, use cases, or UE types, except where explicitly stated.

Overall, CIoT optimizations in 5GS enhance the efficiency and functionality of IoT devices in cellular networks, ensuring seamless data transfer and mobility while accommodating the unique requirements of IoT applications.","The answer should cover the following key points:

How is message throttling and prioritization handled in PFCP according to 3GPP TS 29.244?,"Message throttling and prioritization in PFCP, as outlined in 3GPP TS 29.244, involve several key principles and mechanisms to ensure effective traffic management and congestion control. 

Firstly, priority traffic, such as eMPS (as described in 3GPP TS 22.153) and emergency traffic, is given the highest priority. These types of traffic are exempted from throttling until it becomes absolutely necessary to achieve the requested traffic reduction. This ensures that critical communications are maintained even during network congestion.

For other types of sessions, the relative priority of messages is considered for throttling. Messages deemed to be of lower priority are throttled before higher priority messages. The relative priority can be derived from various session parameters such as APN, QCI, ARP, and LAPI. This targeted approach helps in maintaining a better user experience and effective congestion mitigation compared to random throttling, which is discouraged due to its potential to result in poor overall performance.

In situations where a node is overloaded, message prioritization schemes can be applied as part of a self-protection mechanism. This involves handling incoming initial messages based on their relative priority.

Additionally, message prioritization can be performed based on the PFCP message priority signalled in the PFCP header. The determination of whether to set and use message priority in PFCP signalling is based on operator policy. When a PFCP entity sends a message, it determines the relative message priority according to the principles specified in clause 6.2.4.5.1. If a message affects multiple bearers, the highest priority ARP among all bearers is considered.

For incoming PFCP messages that do not have a message priority in the PFCP header, a default priority is applied if the message is a Request. If the message is a Response, the priority sent in the corresponding Request message is applied. This feature should be supported uniformly across CP and UP functions in the network to ensure consistent handling of messages.

The PFCP message header for session-related messages includes fields such as SEID and Sequence Number, followed by a spare octet. The spare bits are set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver, ensuring a standardized structure for message headers.

Overall, these mechanisms ensure that message throttling and prioritization are handled in a structured and efficient manner, maintaining network performance and user experience during congestion.","The answer must include:
  - Explanation of priority traffic handling and exemption from throttling.
  - Description of how relative priority of messages is determined and applied.

Describe the receiver exclusion band for terminals and the test arrangements for radio equipment as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.124 document.,"The receiver exclusion band for terminals, as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.124 document, extends from the lower frequency of the allocated receiver band minus 85 MHz to the upper frequency of the allocated receiver band plus 85 MHz.

"Describe the conditions and rules for establishing immediate TFO (Tandem Free Operation) in a network, including the criteria for ACS (Active Codec Set) optimization and matching.","Immediate TFO (Tandem Free Operation) can be established in a network under several conditions and rules related to the Active Codec Set (ACS). 

Firstly, immediate TFO can be established if the local and distant ACS are identical, which is often the case within one operator's homogenous network. This requires no optimization and is always acceptable.

For FR (Full Rate) and HR (Half Rate) matching, the rules are stated in clause 12.6. The goal is to enable immediate TFO between 3G channels and 2G FR and 2G HR channels. Optimization rules for FR-HR are detailed in clause 11.4, where the FR_AMR-side adopts the ACS of the HR_AMR-side if supported and allowed by the optimization mode, without interrupting the TFO connection.

The calculation of the Optimized ACS (OACS) is described in clause 12. The Immediate ACS (IACS) is given by the common ACS (CACS) if it is contiguous. The acceptability rules for the OACS are stated in clause 12.5, which include the Highest-Mode-Rule and Lowest-Mode-Rule. The Highest-Mode-Rule ensures that the highest mode in the OACS is not lower than one mode below the minimum of the highest modes of both ACS. The Lowest-Mode-Rule ensures that either the lowest mode of the OACS is not higher than a specific maximum mode or both ACS do not contain lower modes than the lowest mode in the OACS. The specific maximum mode is 5.9 for TFO connections involving a half rate channel and 7.4 otherwise.

If the immediate ACS is already optimal, immediate TFO can be established. If the IACS is a subset of the OACS, immediate TFO is established on a contiguous subset of the OACS, followed by codec mode optimization without interrupting the TFO connection. If immediate TFO cannot be established, both sides must change their ACS to the OACS to enable TFO. If one side does not support an ACS change, the OACS determination rules ensure that the OACS is a contiguous subset of the fixed ACS, allowing TFO connection without the need for an ACS change on that side.

A common ACS (CACS) is acceptable for immediate TFO establishment without consideration of the OACS if all of the following conditions are fulfilled: one radio leg uses FR_AMR or UMTS_AMR_2 or HR_AMR, the other uses HR_AMR; the CACS is contiguous; and the CACS fulfills the acceptability rule.

In cases of codec mismatch, a TFO connection with the currently used AMR codec types may not be possible, but the remaining codec types must be investigated to establish the connection.","The answer must include the conditions for immediate TFO establishment, including the matching and optimization rules for FR and HR channels. It should detail the calculation and acceptability criteria for OACS, including the Highest-Mode-Rule and Lowest-Mode-Rule.

   - The MRO function receives MRO information reports from UEs and analyzes them to determine actions to optimize MRO performance by updating handover parameters if the performance does not meet the targets.
   - The D-SON management function collects MRO-related performance measurements and analyzes them to evaluate MRO performance.
   - If the MRO performance does not meet the targets, the D-SON management function updates the targets, ranges of handover parameters, or control parameters of the MRO function using the provisioning MnS.

3. **LBO Procedure**:
   - The D-SON management function consumes the management service for NF provisioning with the modifyMOIAttributes operation to configure the ranges of handover and/or reselection parameters for the LBO function.
   - The provisioning MnS sets the ranges for the LBO function.
   - The D-SON management function enables the LBO function for a given NR cell if it is not enabled using the NF provisioning MnS.
   - The LBO function collects real-time load information to determine and perform actions to balance traffic loads among NR cells.
   - The D-SON management function collects LBO-related performance measurements and analyzes them to evaluate LBO performance.
   - If the LBO performance does not meet expectations, the D-SON management function updates the ranges of handover and/or reselection parameters using the provisioning MnS.

In all these procedures, the interface between the provisioning MnS and the respective functions (RACH optimization, MRO, and LBO) is not subject to standardization.","The answer must include a detailed description of each procedure (RACH optimization, MRO, and LBO) as outlined in TS 28.313. It should cover the steps involved, the role of the D-SON management function, the operations performed using the provisioning MnS, and how performance measurements are collected and analyzed. Additionally, it should mention that the interface between provisioning MnS and the respective functions is not subject to standardization."
"Describe the process and actions taken by the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control server upon receiving unauthorized RTP media packets from the associated floor participant, including the subsequent state transitions and timer operations.","Upon receiving an indication from the network media interface that RTP media packets with payload are received from the associated floor participant, the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control server undertakes several actions. Firstly, it requests the network media interface in the MCPTT server to not forward the received RTP media packets to the media distributor in the MCPTT server. Secondly, it sends a Floor Revoke message to the associated floor participant. This message includes the Reject Cause field with the value set to #3 (No permission to send a Media Burst). Additionally, if the group call is a broadcast group call, a system call, an emergency call, an imminent peril call, or a temporary group session, the Floor Indicator field is included with appropriate indications.

Following these actions, the floor control interface enters the 'U: not permitted but sends media' state. Upon entering this state, it starts timer T8 (Floor Revoke) and ensures that RTP media packets from the MCPTT client are not forwarded to the media distributor in the MCPTT server. This state transition and the associated operations are crucial for maintaining control and ensuring that unauthorized media packets are not disseminated within the MCPTT server.","The answer should cover the following key points: 
1. The initial actions taken by the floor control interface upon receiving unauthorized RTP media packets, including the request to the network media interface and the sending of a Floor Revoke message with specific fields.
2. The transition to the 'U: not permitted but sends media' state and the operations within this state, including the starting of timer T8 and the prohibition on forwarding RTP media packets.
3. Any specific conditions or types of calls that affect the inclusion of the Floor Indicator field in the Floor Revoke message."
Describe the constants and their roles in the VAD algorithm as specified in TS 26.194.,"The VAD (Voice Activity Detection) algorithm in TS 26.194 utilizes various constants to perform noise estimation, signal level updating, VAD hangover addition, speech estimation, VAD threshold adaptation, and stationary detection. 

Document 1 provides a comprehensive list of these constants and their roles:
- ALPHA_UP1, ALPHA_DOWN1, ALPHA_UP2, ALPHA_DOWN2, ALPHA3, NOISE_MAX, NOISE_MIN, STAT_COUNT, STAT_THR, and STAT_THR_LEVEL are used for updating noise estimates.
- ALPHA4 and ALPHA5 are used for updating average signal levels.
- BURST_HIGH, BURST_P1, BURST_SLOPE, HANG_HIGH, HANG_LOW, HANG_P1, HANG_SLOPE, and VAD_POW_LOW control VAD hangover addition.
- MIN_SPEECH_LEVEL1, MIN_SPEECH_LEVEL2, SP_ACTIVITY_COUNT, SP_ALPHA_DOWN, SP_ALPHA_UP, SP_EST_COUNT, and SP_P1 are constants for speech estimation.
- MIN_SPEECH_SNR, NO_P1, NO_SLOPE, SP_CH_MAX, SP_CH_MIN, SP_SLOPE, and THR_HIGH are used for VAD threshold adaptation.
- POW_TONE_THR and TONE_THR are thresholds for tone detection.
- FRAME_LEN defines the size of a speech frame, which is 256 samples (20 ms).

Document 2 describes the filter bank used in the VAD algorithm. The input signal is divided into frequency bands using a 12-band filter bank. The filter bank consists of 5th and 3rd order filter blocks, which divide the input into high-pass and low-pass parts and decimate the sampling frequency by 2. The coefficients for the all-pass filters in the filter blocks are COEFF5_1, COEFF5_2, and COEFF3. Signal levels are calculated at the output of the filter bank at each frequency band.

Document 3 explains the VAD decision algorithm. The power of the input frame is calculated, and the difference between the signal levels of the input frame and the background noise estimate is determined. The VAD decision is made by comparing the variable snr_sum to a threshold (vad_thr), which is adapted based on estimated speech and background noise levels. The average background noise level is calculated, and if the SNR is lower than the threshold (MIN_SPEECH_SNR), the speech level is increased. The logarithmic value for noise estimate and the threshold for VAD decision are calculated using constants such as NO_SLOPE, SP_SLOPE, NO_P1, SP_P1, THR_HIGH, SP_CH_MAX, and SP_CH_MIN. The intermediate VAD decision is indicated by the variable vadreg.

In summary, the constants play crucial roles in various aspects of the VAD algorithm, including noise estimation, signal level updating, VAD hangover addition, speech estimation, VAD threshold adaptation, and stationary detection, as detailed in TS 26.194.","The answer should include a detailed list of constants from Document 1, explaining their roles in noise estimation, signal level updating, VAD hangover addition, speech estimation, VAD threshold adaptation, and stationary detection. It should also describe the filter bank from Document 2, including the cut-off frequencies, filter blocks, and coefficients. Finally, it should explain the VAD decision algorithm from Document 3, covering the calculation of power, signal levels, background noise estimate, SNR, and the threshold for VAD decision."

"Describe the requirements and conditions for UE measurement reporting when highSpeedEnhancedMeasFlag is configured, including the accuracy and delay specifications.","When the highSpeedEnhancedMeasFlag is configured, the User Equipment (UE) must be able to identify a new detectable FDD intra-frequency cell within the time period Tidentify_intra as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.1.2.2.1.2. A cell is considered detectable if the following conditions are met for the corresponding band: RSRP related conditions (clauses 9.1.2.1 and 9.1.2.2), RSRQ related conditions (clause 9.1.5.1), RS-SINR related conditions (clause 9.1.17.2.1), and SCH_RP and SCH Ês/Iot conditions according to Annex B.2.1.

In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the measurement period for intra-frequency measurements is Tmeasure_intra, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.133 clause 8.1.2.2.1.2. The UE must be capable of performing RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements for up to 8 identified intra-frequency cells and report these measurements to higher layers within the Tmeasure_intra period. The accuracy of RSRP measurements for all measured cells must comply with the specifications in clauses 9.1.2.1 and 9.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 36.133, while the accuracy of RSRQ measurements must comply with clause 9.1.5.1.

Event triggered measurement reports must meet the requirements specified in clauses 9.1.2.1, 9.1.2.2, and 9.1.5.1 of 3GPP TS 36.133. The UE should not send any event triggered measurement reports unless the reporting criteria are fulfilled. The measurement reporting delay, defined as the time between the event triggering the report and the UE starting to transmit the report over the air interface, must be less than Tidentify_intra, excluding delays caused by other RRC signaling or lack of UL resources. If L3 filtering is used, additional delay can be expected.

If a cell becomes undetectable for a period of ≤ 5 seconds and then becomes detectable again, triggering an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay must be less than TMeasurement_Period Intra, provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than 50 Ts and L3 filtering has not been used. The normative references for these requirements are 3GPP TS 36.133 clauses 8.1.2.2.1.2 and A.8.1.40.

"Describe the functional entities involved in the IOPS MC system as per 3GPP TS 23.180, including their roles and interactions.","The IOPS MC system, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.180, comprises several functional entities that support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation. These entities include the IOPS MC connectivity function, the IOPS distribution function, and the signalling application server.

1. **IOPS MC Connectivity Function**: This entity is responsible for providing supporting MC services in the IOPS mode of operation. It includes functionalities such as registering and discovering users within the IOPS MC system. The IOPS MC connectivity function is a specific instantiation of the GCS AS, which manages unicast and multicast transmissions for group communication-related sessions. It is supported by the signalling application server functional entity of the signalling control plane.

2. **IOPS Distribution Function**: This entity supports the distribution of IP packets containing MC service application data received from an MC service UE in the IOPS mode of operation. Utilizing information provided by the IOPS MC connectivity function (such as IP addresses and transport layer ports), it performs the following tasks:
   - Receiving uplink IP transmissions from the MC service UE via the MCPTT-IOPS-3 reference point for MCPTT and the MCData-IOPS-3 reference point for MCData.
   - Distributing the related IP packets via downlink IP unicast transmissions to MC service UEs through the same reference points.
   - Distributing the related IP packets via downlink IP multicast transmissions to MC service UEs via the MCPTT-IOPS-4 reference point for MCPTT and the MCData-IOPS-4 reference point for MCData.

3. **Signalling Application Server**: This functional entity supports all required transactions related to IOPS discovery within the IOPS MC system. This includes supporting registration, publication, subscription, and notification events.

The overall composition of the IOPS MC system includes these three functional entities, each playing a crucial role in ensuring the effective operation and management of MC services in the IOPS mode.","The answer should include a detailed description of each functional entity within the IOPS MC system, their specific roles, and how they interact with each other. It should cover the IOPS MC connectivity function's role in user registration and discovery, the IOPS distribution function's role in IP packet distribution, and the signalling application server's role in supporting discovery-related transactions. Additionally, it should mention the reference points involved in the distribution function and the overall composition of the IOPS MC system."
"Describe the structure and processing of DIMS Units, including the roles of the DIMS Unit Header and Body, and the different processing states.","A DIMS Unit is composed of a header and a body. The DIMS Unit Body can either be a complete SVG document or a textually concatenated sequence of scene commands. The body may also be compressed. The DIMS Unit Header is 1 byte long and includes several fields: S (is-Scene), M (is-RAP), I (is-redundant), D (redundant-exit), P (priority), C (compression), and X (reserved). Each field has a specific role in signaling the characteristics and processing requirements of the DIMS Unit.

The processing of DIMS Units occurs in three states: normal, tune-in, and redundant-processing. In the normal state, redundant units are discarded while non-redundant units are processed. In the tune-in state, only units marked as RAP are processed, and others are discarded. In the redundant-processing state, both redundant units and non-redundant RAP units are processed, while other units are discarded.

High-priority units must be processed during normal decoding, while low-priority units should be processed but can be ignored without causing errors or requiring tune-in or repair states. The pseudo-code for processing DIMS Units in each state ensures that the terminal handles the units appropriately based on their flags and priority, maintaining the integrity and continuity of the scene.","The answer should include:
  - The structure of a DIMS Unit, including the header and body.
  - The types of DIMS Unit Bodies (complete SVG document or sequence of scene commands).
