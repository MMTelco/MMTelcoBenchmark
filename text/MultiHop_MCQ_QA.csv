1,1,Which entity is responsible for providing past location information as per the identified gaps in TS 23.280?,Only the Location Management Server (LMS) if it stores historical data.,"The MC service server, since it initiates requests.",Both LMS and the target MC service ID’s location management client if they have storage capabilities.,None of them; past location information is not supported in current specifications.,Option C,"The main context explicitly states that past location information can be provided either by the LMS (if it stores data) or the target MC service ID’s location management client (if they store for a defined period). This aligns with aspect ""b"" and ""c"" in use case #12, requiring no references to sections but relying on understanding storage capabilities distributed between entities."
2,2,"To distinguish past location information from the latest report in responses, which mechanism is essential?",Timestamp fields indicating when the location was acquired.,Unique identifiers for each MC service server request.,Separate protocol messages reserved exclusively for historical data.,Priority flags to mark older reports as deprecated.,Option A,"The main context highlights aspect ""e,"" which requires identifying and separating past location information from the latest report. Timestamps are a standard technical solution in telecom protocols (e.g., 3GPP) for time-based separation, making this the most plausible answer without requiring additional messages or identifiers."
3,3,"What modification is needed to existing information flows (e.g., Tables 10.9.2.3-1 to -3) to support requesting past location data?",Removing latency constraints in the LMS-to-client message path.,Adding parameters specifying time ranges or retention periods in request messages.,Increasing the maximum allowed size of location information reports.,Requiring authentication for all historical data requests.,Option B,"The main context identifies gaps where current flows (described in the reference tables) lack elements to specify past timeframes. Adding parameters like time ranges or retention periods aligns with aspect ""a"" of use case #12, as this directly addresses how to request historical data without altering message sizes or paths fundamentally."
4,4,"In a 3GPP-compliant network using the location reporting procedure described in TS 23.280 clause 10.9.3.1, which scenario would **require** the use of unicast bearer instead of MBMS for sending configuration updates to multiple Location Management Clients?  
•","All clients share identical location reporting criteria and no new triggers from solution #1 or #2 are applied.  
•","Clients have varying location reporting configurations due to different trigger conditions added in solutions #1 and #2.  
•","The configuration update only modifies non-critical parameters like measurement accuracy, not event triggers.  
•","The network is operating in single MC system mode as specified in NOTE 1 of the reference content.  
•","Option B  
•","The reference states that configurations can be sent via MBMS to multiple clients ""at the same time"" when using group messages. However, NOTE 3 clarifies that different clients may have distinct criteria. If solutions #1 and #2 introduce new triggers that differentiate client configurations (e.g., some require cell change while others need MBMS SAI changes), a unicast approach would be necessary to individually address each client with its tailored settings. MBMS group messaging cannot handle per-client variations efficiently in this case."
5,5,"When configuring location reporting for an emergency alert trigger added via solution #1, which constraint must be strictly adhered to according to the referenced procedure?  
•","The location report must include ECGI and PLMN identifiers but exclude speed or altitude.  
•","The configuration message can only be sent during initial registration of the UE.  
•","Emergency alert triggers override all previously configured event conditions for affected clients.  
•","The procedure is limited to operation within a single Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MC) system as per NOTE 1.  
•","Option D  
•","The reference explicitly states in NOTE 1 that the entire procedure applies ""for single MC system operation only."" This constraint remains binding even when adding new triggers like emergency alerts via solution #1. Deploying such triggers across multiple MC systems would violate this restriction, necessitating adherence to the single-system limitation."
6,6,"A network operator wants to minimize signaling overhead while updating location reporting configurations for 100 UEs with mixed trigger requirements (some using solution #1, others solution #2). Which approach is **invalid** under the described procedure?  
•","Use MBMS bearers for clients sharing identical criteria and unicast for those needing custom triggers.  
•","Rely on pre-stored user profiles (as in NOTE 2) for UEs with unchanged configurations.  
•","Consolidate all updates into a single broadcast message, ignoring per-UE differences.  
•","Avoid sending configuration messages to UEs that already have the required triggers from prior updates.  
•","Option C  
•","The reference allows group messaging (MBMS) only when configurations are uniform for multiple clients (step 1). If UEs require distinct trigger conditions (e.g., some with solution #1 and others with #2), consolidating into a single broadcast message would fail because it cannot address per-UE differences. This violates the procedure’s requirement to handle varying criteria individually or via segmentation, as noted in NOTE 3."
7,7,"Why would an MC system use an MBMS bearer for application level control signaling during a location reporting temporary configuration request?  
•","To reduce latency compared to unicast transmissions  
•","To handle high load scenarios more efficiently  
•","To ensure lower packet loss than media bearers  
•","To allow individual member-specific responses  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context explicitly states that MBMS bearers for application level control signaling are used beyond resource efficiency, such as handling high load scenarios. While the main content mentions multicast (compatible with MBMS), the direct justification aligns with improved scalability in high-load cases rather than solely packet loss or latency requirements."
8,8,"In group-addressed location reporting temporary configuration requests, why do MC clients typically not respond to application level control signaling?  
•","To avoid overwhelming the network with redundant responses  
•","Because multicast messages lack individual addressing capabilities  
•","As per protocol rules requiring explicit instructions to respond  
•","To prioritize media bearer traffic over control signaling  
•","Option C  
•","The reference context mandates that clients ""shall not send responses"" unless instructed, a protocol requirement. This applies even when group-addressed messages (like those in the main content) are used for location reporting configurations."
9,9,"What QoS characteristic distinguishes MBMS bearers for application level control signaling from media bearers during location reporting?  
•","Lower latency requirements for real-time media  
•","Stricter packet loss requirements to ensure reliability  
•","Higher bandwidth allocation for multimedia content  
•","Support for dynamic service area adjustments  
•","Option B  
•","The reference specifies that MBMS bearers for control signaling have stricter packet loss requirements than media bearers, directly impacting their QoS configuration. This is critical for reliable delivery of messages like location reporting configurations (main context), even when using multicast."
10,10,"Which IEEE standard defines the time-aware scheduling with absolute cyclic time boundaries required for 5G-based Ethernet links supporting high performance applications?  
•","IEEE 802.1AS  
•","IEEE 802.1Qbv  
•","IEEE 802.3br  
•","IEEE 802.1AR  
•","Option B  
•","The reference content explicitly states that time-aware scheduling with absolute cyclic time boundaries is defined by IEEE 802.1Qbv, which is part of the TSN enhancements required for 5G-based Ethernet links. While IEEE 802.1AS (Option A) addresses clock synchronization, it does not specify scheduling mechanisms like Qbv."
11,11,"What is a critical requirement for clock synchronization accuracy in infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications within 3GPP systems?  
•","±5 ms deviation  
•","Better than 1 µs  
•","Synchronized via GPS only  
•","±20 ns jitter  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context mandates that clock synchronization accuracy for high performance Ethernet applications must be ""better than 1µs,"" making this the correct requirement. Options like ±5 ms or GPS dependency are too lenient or restrictive compared to specified standards."
12,12,"How does the 3GPP system ensure coexistence of hard-real-time (RT) traffic and lower-priority traffic over Ethernet links?  
•","Lower-priority traffic must use separate physical channels  
•","Hard-RT traffic has absolute scheduling priority, preventing performance degradation from lower-priority flows  
•","All traffic is treated equally to maintain fairness  
•","Lower-priority traffic dynamically adjusts its rate based on network load  
•","Option B  
•","The reference specifies that hard-RT traffic follows a time-aware schedule (e.g., via IEEE 802.1Qbv), and lower-priority traffic cannot degrade their performance. This ensures strict scheduling priority for critical flows, which aligns with Option B rather than requiring physical separation or equal treatment."
13,13,What is the maximum allowable synchronicity budget (in nanoseconds) for **both** the global time domain and any working clock domain within a 5G system?,900 ns,"1,000 ns","1 µs (equivalent to 1,000 ns)",500 ns,A) **900 ns**,"The reference context explicitly states that the synchronicity budget for both domains must not exceed **900 nanoseconds**, regardless of their specific precision requirements.

14,14,"During an SSC Mode 2 PDU Session Anchor change procedure, how does the UE receive the updated local DNS server address for the same DN?",The old SMF directly sends the DNS address to the UE via a dedicated message.,The new DNS address is provided through ePCO in the **PDU Session Establishment Accept** of the re-established session.,DHCP automatically provides the updated DNS address after PDU Session Release.,The AMF includes the DNS address in the **Registration Accept** following re-establishment.,B,"During an SSC Mode 2 anchor change, the UE releases the old session and initiates a new establishment (step 3 of the reference). The SMF selects the new UPF based on stored target DNAI information. In the **PDU Session Establishment Accept**, the DNS address is conveyed via ePCO (main content step 5), ensuring the UE receives the updated configuration for the same DN.

15,15,"Which existing service operation could be extended by the SMF to implement the forwarding of UP packets carrying DNS queries as part of Step 2?  
•","Nsmf_PDUSession_SendMOData  
•","Nnef_TrafficInfluence  
•","Nsmf_EventExposure  
•","Nnef_NIDD  
•","Option A  
•","The SMF service operation for Step 2 can extend Nsmf_PDUSession_SendMOData (described in the reference) because it aligns with sending MO data to the SMF, even though its original purpose was for UE-initiated small data. This extension allows reusing existing interfaces while adapting for DNS query forwarding requirements."
16,16,"During a PDU session re-anchoring procedure in SSC Mode 2 or 3, what mechanism ensures the new SMF is selected based on the target DNAI?",The UE directly selects the SMF using the stored DNAI from its configuration.,The AMF stores the target DNAI received via `Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify` and uses it to select the SMF during subsequent PDU Session Establishment.,The old SMF (SMF1) directly selects the new SMF by querying a centralized database.,The UPF autonomously switches to a suitable SMF based on DNAI connectivity.,B,"Both sections emphasize that the target DNAI is communicated from SMF1 to AMF via `Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify`, and the AMF stores this information (without transferring it externally, e.g., during AMF relocation). During PDU Session re-establishment, the AMF uses this stored DNAI to select the appropriate new SMF.

17,17,"When establishing a unicast PC5 link via UE-to-Network Relay in 5GS ProSe, which mechanism ensures the application's priority requirement overrides the default QoS characteristics mapped to a PQI value?",The Relay modifies the PFI based on the target UE's capabilities.,The application layer directly configures the PCF to adjust the PQI mapping table.,The source UE’s indicated priority is applied to override the Default Priority Level of the selected PQI.,"The AMF enforces a global QoS profile for all V2X services, overriding individual priorities.",Option C,"According to the reference context (NOTE 3), an application can indicate a priority that overrides the Default Priority Level specified in the standardized PQI mapping. In the main process, during step 1 where E2E QoS parameters are set via PFI, this override mechanism applies directly without requiring modifications to network components like PCF or AMF."
18,18,"During the split of E2E QoS parameters into source and target parts by a Relay in ProSe, which statement accurately describes the use of standardized PQI values?",The Relay selects PQIs based solely on the application’s interactive service requirements from TS 22.261.,PQI mappings are mandatory for V2X services but cannot be combined with application-specific priorities under any scenario.,"PQIs define default QoS characteristics (e.g., priority level), which may be adjusted by the application’s indicated priority as per the mapping table’s rules.",The Relay must use alternative QoS profiles instead of standardized PQI values to ensure compliance with TS 23.287.,Option C,"The reference context clarifies that PQIs map to default characteristics but allow application priorities to override them (NOTE 3). This aligns with the main process where the Relay splits E2E QoS parameters using these mappings without relying on unsupported alternative profiles (as noted in ""Alternative QoS Profiles aren’t supported"")."
19,19,"In a UE-to-Network Relay scenario, why are standardized PQI values critical when configuring PC5 QoS flows?",They ensure backward compatibility with legacy systems not supporting application-layer priority overrides.,The mappings guarantee interoperability by providing a predefined set of parameters for default and override scenarios.,"PQIs eliminate the need for Relays to process E2E QoS parameters, simplifying network architecture.","They are required exclusively for non-V2X services, as V2X relies entirely on dynamic application priorities.",Option B,"The reference context specifies that standardized PQI mappings define default characteristics (e.g., priority levels) while allowing overrides by applications. In the main process, this ensures that even with splits into source/target parameters via Relays, predefined interoperable QoS rules are maintained without requiring dynamic parameter renegotiation for every use case."
20,20,"When configuring a UE for V2X direct discovery over the PC5 interface, which parameter determines whether metadata is included in the discovery messages?  
•","The size of the Uu interface message buffer.  
•","The SLA-defined service domain requirements from the operator.  
•","The geographical area coverage of the TA list mapped by the PCF.  
•","The maximum allowed payload size of the PC5-S message.  
•","Option D  
•","According to the note in the main content, whether metadata is included depends on the size constraints of the PC5-S message. If the metadata exceeds this limit, it may not be configured directly via the PC1 interface (as noted), making option D correct. Other options relate to SLA agreements, area mapping, or Uu interface parameters, which are unrelated to payload size limits."
21,21,"How does the NG-RAN become aware that a UE is authorized for direct discovery over PC5?  
•","The AMF provides this authorization status during N2 establishment based on PCF policy.  
•","The V2X Application Server directly signals the NG-RAN via NEF during service provisioning.  
•","The UE autonomously requests access after receiving metadata from the AF.  
•","The SMF includes discovery permissions in session establishment messages to NG-RAN.  
•","Option A  
•","In the main context, it states that when the AMF confirms authorization based on area information from PCF (guided by AF inputs), it informs the corresponding NG-RAN during N2 setup for the UE. This excludes direct signaling from V2X AS or SMF involvement."
22,22,"Which function processes V2X service parameters from the Application Server to map geographical area information into TA lists before provisioning them to the UE?  
•","The AMF, using subscription data and location registration inputs.  
•","The NEF, as part of normalizing application data formats for network functions.  
•","The PCF, by translating service domain SLAs into access control policies.  
•","The PCF, converting area parameters received via the AF/NEF into TA lists for UE configuration.  
•","Option D  
•","From the main context, PCF handles authorization and provisioning of parameters like geographical TAs mapped from area info provided by the AF (V2X App Server) through NEF. The note specifies this mapping responsibility lies with the policy function (PCF), not AMF or NEF translation roles."
23,23,What must a User Equipment (UE) first perform before initiating discovery announcement or solicitation on the PC5 interface?,Obtain security keys directly from another UE.,Receive provisioned authorization via the ProSe Application Function through NEF from the V2X Application Server.,Generate an application user ID without network interaction.,Wait for a metadata request to trigger parameter configuration.,B,"According to the MAIN CONTEXT, UEs must first obtain authorization and provisioning (Step 1), which aligns with the REFERENCE CONTEXT’s process where V2X Application Servers use NEF to provision service parameters into the 5GC for PC5 communications. This ensures security and policy compliance before discovery procedures can occur.

292,292,"When an operator disagrees with test results from a vendor's security compliance testing, which process is initiated according to the described frameworks?  
•","The operator must re-accredit their own laboratory using SECAM standards before disputing.  
•","The operator may enter a conflict resolution process involving the SECAM Accreditation Body.  
•","The vendor is required to revise tests using tools defined by 3GPP for dispute resolution.  
•","The operator must independently repeat all security compliance tests without oversight.

•","The reference context explicitly states that if an operator disagrees with test results, they can initiate a conflict resolution process involving the SECAM Accreditation Body and the vendor. This aligns with the mention of dispute resolution being managed by the SECAM body (outside 3GPP scope), making this the correct choice. Option A is incorrect because operators do not need to be accredited to perform supplementary evaluations, while option C incorrectly assigns responsibility to 3GPP for defining tools, which is outside their scope. Option D ignores the reference’s clarification that retesting by the operator is optional and does not require repeating all tests."
293,293,"Which factor allows an operator to trust third-party evaluation results without conducting full retests?  
•","The mandatory requirement for operators to use SECAM-accredited tools exclusively.  
•","Accreditation documents from the SECAM Accreditation Body attesting to vendors’ and labs’ trustworthiness.  
•","Internal operator policies overriding third-party compliance testing outcomes.  
•","Automatic validation of all test results if submitted via standardized 3GPP formats.

297,297,"Why does SECAM define one security baseline per network product class rather than allowing multiple baselines?  
•","To ensure uniform security requirements across all network elements regardless of their role.  
•","Because the attacker model, operational environment assumptions, and security requirements are tailored specifically to each product class's threat landscape.  
•","To simplify compliance audits by reducing the number of standards.  
•","Due to technical limitations in virtualized environments that prevent customization per instance.  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context explicitly states that the security baseline is defined based on the attacker model, operational environment assumptions, and requirements specific to each product class's threat analysis. This tailored approach ensures effectiveness against identified risks for that class, making a single baseline sufficient. Other options misrepresent the rationale (e.g., uniformity or simplicity are not mentioned; technical limitations in virtualization are contradicted by the main context)."
298,298,"How does exposure level of a network element influence its security requirements according to the threat and risk analysis outcomes?  
•","Less exposed elements require stricter hardening to compensate for potential internal threats.  
•","Exposed nodes may implement more demanding requirements, such as enhanced hardening measures, due to their higher vulnerability to external attacks.  
•","Exposure level only affects the operational environment assumptions but not the security requirements themselves.  
•","Security requirements are identical across exposed and less exposed elements to maintain consistency in baseline definitions.  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context clarifies that security requirements can be more demanding for exposed nodes (e.g., hardening) compared to less exposed elements, as their threat potential differs based on attacker access. This aligns with the attacker model and vulnerability assessment depth tied to exposure, making Option B correct. Other options either reverse logic or ignore the explicit link between exposure and requirement stringency."
299,299,"In cases where existing network product classes cannot adequately represent a new configuration (e.g., collapsed RNC/NBs), what does SECAM recommend?

•","Merge multiple baselines into one to cover all potential scenarios.  
•","Increase the operational environment assumptions scope to include non-standard configurations temporarily.  
•","Option B  
•","The reference explicitly notes that SECAM may define a new product class (e.g., collapsed RNC/NBs) when no existing baseline fits, as stated in the ""NOTE"" section. This ensures each configuration has a specific attacker model and requirements aligned with its unique threat profile. Other options either ignore the note or suggest invalid methods like merging baselines or temporary assumptions."

•","Verify the Security Requirements
•","Identify the security requirements and test cases
•","Define the security problem
•","Describe and model the network product class
•","Option D
•","The MAIN CONTEXT specifies that when describing and modelling a virtualised network product class, analysts must consider whether components are decoupled (e.g., type2 implementations). This step determines if interfaces between components require security requirements. If not assessed here, subsequent steps like defining the security problem or identifying requirements may overlook interface risks inherent to decoupled architectures."
301,301,"Why is precise definition of terms such as ""management traffic"" critical during the identification of security requirements for SCAS documents?
•","To simplify verification processes by reducing documentation needs
•","To prevent ambiguity in test case execution and avoid disputes over requirement fulfillment
•","To ensure compatibility with non-3GPP virtualisation layers
•","To align threat analysis exclusively with external attacker models
•","Option B
•","The REFERENCE CONTEXT emphasizes that vague terminology (e.g., ""management traffic"") risks inconsistent interpretations during testing. This ambiguity could lead to judgment calls in test execution, potentially causing disagreements between parties over whether requirements are met, as highlighted in the example provided."

303,303,"What is the primary reason the SCAS emphasizes identifying security requirements that may not be captured through ordinary testing of network elements?  
•","Because 3GPP has developed comprehensive test cases for all network elements  
•","Because vendors must independently ensure compliance with non-security procedures only  
•","Because 3GPP does not provide test specifications for network elements, relying on vendors' testing which might miss security aspects embedded in broader procedures  
•","Because all security requirements are explicitly tested through 34-series specifications  
•","Option C  
•","The SCAS focuses on highlighting specific security requirements because 3GPP does not develop test specifications for network elements (relying on vendor testing), and these requirements may be embedded in non-security procedures, leading to gaps if only standard tests are performed."
304,304,Why does 3GPP not develop standardized test specifications for network elements' security procedures?,To reduce complexity in certification processes,Vendors are entrusted to handle their own testing responsibilities,Insufficient industry demand for such specifications,Focus on user equipment testing is prioritized,Option B,"The reference context explicitly states that 3GPP does not develop test specifications for network elements because they trust vendors to conduct their own tests, unlike UE testing which is managed under TS 34-series by RAN5."

This aligns with the requirement in TS 36.331, ensuring coordination without violating ROM restrictions (e.g., IRAT reselection or paging-related operations). Options A and C are invalid because cell reselection to another RAT is prohibited in ROM, and inter-RAT handover is unrelated to resource signaling. Option D is incorrect since CSG cells are explicitly excluded from ROM support."

•","Option C  
•","The correct answer is Option C because AR-5.2.10.2-b explicitly requires mechanisms to allow the EAS to update its published KPIs or requirements when changes occur, such as altered resource needs for an existing instance. Option A corresponds to new application onboarding, which uses the mechanism described in AR-5.2.10.2-a (initial publication).

• Question: What distinguishes how Sy and Cx interfaces handle feature dependency across nodes?  
• Option A: Sy requires mandatory capabilities via I-CSCF selection, while Cx uses dynamic discovery only.  
• Option B: Cx allows features to depend on each other through S-CSCF capabilities, whereas Sy mandates features be independent.  
• Option C: Both use Feature-List-ID 1 exclusively for all post-rel versions without differentiation.  
• Option D: Sy’s base is Rel-11 while Cx starts at Rel-5, but both require cleared M bits on new AVPs regardless of dependency.  
• Answer: Option D  
•","The main content specifies Sy uses Rel-11 as baseline and cleared M bits for features (like Cx), while reference notes Cx’s Rel-5 base.

1866,1866,"Why is an existing unused bit within the UE Network Capability or UE Security Capability information element suitable for indicating user plane integrity protection support?  
•","It avoids additional signaling overhead since these elements are already transmitted to the RAN.  
•","The network requires fixed-length fields for all new capabilities.  
•","Frequency band-specific adaptations ensure backward compatibility.  
•","Unused bits in these elements guarantee better encryption strength.  
•","Option A  
•",Reusing an unused bit in existing information elements (UE Network Capability or UE Security Capability) eliminates the need for additional signaling because these elements are already part of standard messages sent to the RAN. This avoids protocol complexity and ensures compatibility without introducing new fields.
1867,1867,"How does this solution mitigate Man-in-the-Middle attacks when communicating integrity protection capabilities?  
•","The bit is randomly generated for each session, making replay impossible.  
•","NAS signaling protects the information element end-to-end, and it is validated at both ends (UE and network).  
•","Unused bits are inherently more secure due to their obscurity.  
•","Integrity protection algorithms are only enabled after mutual authentication completes.  
•","Option B  
•","The solution leverages existing NAS signaling security mechanisms, which protect the information element end-to-end between the UE and core network. Additionally, replaying the bit’s value to the UE ensures consistency and detects tampering, preventing MitM attacks without requiring new security measures."
1868,1868,"Why is it unnecessary to define a new information element for this capability?  
•","The existing UE Network Capability and Security Capability elements have unused bits that can be repurposed.

1871,1871,"When handling a request for tracking unknown UAVs in a specific geographic area from a USS/UTM, which mechanism ensures only UAVs authorized by the requesting USS/UTM are included in the response?  
•","The AMF verifies the validity of each UAV's aerial subscription with the CAA.  
•","The AMF filters UAVs based on stored USS/UTM identifiers associated with their 3GPP UAV IDs.  
•","The NEF selects between AMF or GMLC based on the geographic area mapping to TAI/Cell Ids.  
•","The UAVF compares the reported UAV locations against the target area using GPS coordinates.  
•","Option B  
•","The correct answer is Option B because the main content specifies that the AMF filters UAVs by checking if they have been authorized by the USS/UTM, referencing stored identifiers (as per clause 8.5 and explicit mention of ""USS/UTM authorization""). The reference material also highlights mapping between 3GPP UAV IDs and internal identifiers like SUPI, which ties to stored associations with specific USS/UTMs. Other options address subscriptions, procedure selection, or location comparison but do not directly enforce the requester's authorization check."
1872,1872,"In Solution #25, what ensures that an unknown UAV tracking request from a USS/UTM only returns results for UAVs under its jurisdiction?  
•","The AMF maps the geographic area to 3GPP TAI/Cell Ids and excludes unregistered devices.  
•","The UAVF associates each returned 3GPP UAV ID with the requesting USS/UTM's identifier during response generation.  
•","The NEF enforces access control by validating the USS/UTM's administrative privileges before initiating the request.  
•","The AMF filters UAVs based on authorization records linking their SUPI to the requesting USS/UTM’s GPSI mapping.  
•","Option B  
•","Option B is correct because the main content states that after filtering, the UAVF ensures responses include UAVs authorized by the requester by matching 3GPP IDs with stored associations (not just internal mappings like SUPI).

•","Option B  
•","According to the reference context, static authorization relies on the NRF's discovery check (Nnrf_NFDiscovery) and subsequent local policy evaluation by the NF Service Producer (MFAF). Since MFAF adheres to SBA mechanisms per the main content, this dual-step verification aligns with both sections. TLS/HTTPS handles transport security but does not replace authorization checks."
1875,1875,"What ensures confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between NFs via MFAF within a single PLMN?

1876,1876,"In scenarios where token-based authorization is disabled, how does MFAF ensure an NF Service Consumer is authorized to receive data?  
•","The NRF blocks all non-token requests to enforce strict security.  
•","The MFAF relies on the consumer's IP address for implicit permission checks.  
•","The producer validates access via its local authorization policy after discovery approval by the NRF.  
•","Data transmission proceeds without authorization due to TLS encryption sufficiency.  
•","Option C  
•","Per reference content, if token-based auth is disabled, the NF Service Producer (MFAF) enforces authorization through its own local policies post-NRF discovery verification. This follows SBA requirements outlined in both sections, ensuring layered security without tokens."
1877,1877,"In a roaming scenario between two PLMNs, if an NF Service Consumer (NFc) from a PLMN using only static authorization attempts to access an NF Service Producer (NFp) that requires OAuth authorization, what is the expected outcome?  
•","The service request proceeds successfully because the NRF authorizes it during discovery.  
•","The NFp grants access based on local policies since static authorization was used.  
•","The NFc automatically switches to OAuth after receiving the discovery response.  
•","The NFp rejects the request due to missing token, as OAuth is required but not provided.  
•","Option D  
•","According to TS 29.510, if the NFp requires OAuth (via the oauthRequired flag in discovery), the NFc must obtain a token first. Since the NFc only supports static authorization, it cannot provide the token, leading the NFp to reject the request. The NRF may have authorized during discovery but does not resolve this mismatch at the service access layer."

•","Incompatibility between local policy checks and token-based requirements in service requests.  
•","The absence of a discovery procedure in one of the PLMNs.  
•","Option C  
•","The conflict arises because static authorization relies on local policies, while OAuth requires tokens.

1999,1999,"What is the primary trigger for a UAS application server to switch C2 communication to UTM-Navigated mode as described?  
•","The UAV's battery level drops below 20%  
•","The UAV enters a predefined no-fly zone detected by the USS/UTM  
•","The UAV controller loses video feedback from the UAV  
•","Network latency exceeds 100ms during direct communication  
•","Option B  
•","The main context specifies that switching to UTM-Navigated occurs when a ""C2 switching condition"" is detected, such as entering a no-fly zone. This aligns with the reference context's example of UTM taking over in cases like proximity to restricted zones. Other options (e.g., battery levels or latency) are not explicitly tied to the server-initiated switch described."
2000,2000,"Why might an operator prefer Network-Assisted C2 communication over Direct C2 for beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) UAV operations?  
•","To enable lower latency control messages for manual steering  
•","To ensure reliable routing when the UAV and controller are connected via different 5G cells  
•","To reduce power consumption on the UAV's communication module  
•","To prioritize video feedback bandwidth for real-time monitoring  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context states Network-Assisted uses the 5G network, allowing operation across multiple nodes (different cells), critical for BLOS. Direct C2 requires a direct link, which may fail over long distances or terrain obstacles. Other options misrepresent latency priorities (manual steering can use either mode) and power/video trade-offs not specified as primary factors."
2001,2001,"Which control mode is exclusively associated with UTM-Navigated C2 communication?  
•","Direct stick steering with video feedback  
•","Steer to waypoints for routine navigation  
•","Automatic flight using a pre-scheduled 4D polygon route  
•","Low-latency manual override commands  
•","Option C  
•","The reference context explicitly ties ""Automatic flight by UTM"" (using pre-scheduled routes) and ""approaching autonomous infrastructure"" to UTM-Navigated mode. Other modes like steer-to-waypoints or stick steering are shared across Direct/Network-Assisted, while low-latency overrides aren’t specified as exclusive."

•","The client is the original initiator of the emergency alert.  
•","The group has no other affiliated members still in emergency state.  
•","The request includes sufficient technical authentication credentials.  
•","The requesting user is authorized based on implementation-defined roles (e.g., dispatcher).  
•","Option D  
•","The reference context specifies that an authorized user (e.g., a dispatcher or supervisor) can cancel the group’s emergency state, while the main content emphasizes that the server separately evaluates such requests.

•","Whenever the server denies the group’s emergency state cancellation.  
•","Option B  
•","The reference context explicitly states that acknowledgments are not sent during multicast cancellations ""unless configured otherwise,"" directly tying this behavior to the technical implementation of unicast versus multicast protocols."
2026,2026,"Why might an MC service server accept a client’s request to cancel its own emergency state but reject cancellation of the group’s emergency state?  
•","The client lacks sufficient privileges for group-level changes.  
•","Another member’s active emergency state via a different protocol (e.g., SDS or TS 23.280) persists.  
•","Multicast transmission failed to propagate the cancellation to all members.  
•","The server requires manual override before modifying group status.  
•","Option B  
•","The main context mentions separate procedures (e.g., via SDS or TS 23.280) that could independently sustain the group’s emergency state, even if one client cancels its own status. This interplay between overlapping protocols explains why the server might reject a group cancellation while approving an individual one."
